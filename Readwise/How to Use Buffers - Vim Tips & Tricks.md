## Highlights
- **Buffer Management Instructions in Vim**
  - **Switch to the next buffer:** Use the command `:bnext` or its shortcut `:bn`. 
  - **Switch to the previous buffer:** Use `:bprevious` or `:bp`. 
  - **Jump to a buffer by index:** Use `:b` followed by the index number, e.g., `:b 1`. 
  - **Switch to a buffer by name or partial name:** Use `:b` followed by part of the buffer's name, e.g., `:b ori`. 
  - **Jump to the first or last buffer:** Use `:bfirst` or `:blast`. 
  - **Close a buffer without closing Vim:** Use `:bd` followed by the buffer index or name, e.g., `:bd 1`. 
  - **Create a new buffer (unsaved):** Use `:e` followed by a filename or `:enew` for a new unnamed buffer. 
  - **Set 'hidden' option to allow buffer switching without saving:** Use `:set hidden`. 
  - **Use buffer index for quick navigation:** Use `b` command with index, e.g., `:b 3`.

  So we're still in our shell and this vim buffers directory. Let's see what files are here. Let's open up the first one, CLI tool replacements in vim. So now vim loaded this file into memory as a buffer. It's also directly displayed in this window. So this is the active buffer for now. We can get a list of our buffers with ls. So currently we just have this one buffer, CLI tool replacements. So let's open up a few more files let's use the edit command for that go into command mode edit and just tap our way through the files we have here so let's open comparing fuzzy finders and Also let's open origins of bin so now we have multiple buffers open let's see the list again with ls each of these buffers has a name it also has an index and it also has a status and some other Symbol there. The current buffer is marked with a percentage sign so origins of Vim is the buffer we currently have open. Then there's the concept of the alternate buffer, that's the last buffer you've been to. You can quickly switch between the last buffer and the current buffer with a shortcut we'll see later. And the H in this list means the buffer is hidden and the A means it's active so let's switch a little bit around between these buffers there are a few methods you can do this for example If i wanted to switch to the next buffer in the list i can simply type buffer next and now i'm at comparing fuzzy finders let's list out the buffers again the percentage sign is now at buffer Number two comparing fuzzy finders and origins of vim is marked as the alternate buffer to switch quickly between the alternate buffer and the current buffer you can use ctrl caret So you can spam this and switch between those buffers very quickly and very easily so if you only have two files you're switching between this is a very handy shortcut by the way in the Comments of one of my last videos there was a request to create a official vim cheat sheet from my side so i actually did that and it's linked in the description below feel free to take a Look let's list the buffers again also you can use the index to jump to a buffer so if i wanted to jump to cli tool replacements i can simply type b and then the index and now at CLI tool replacements. What you can also do is use the name or parts of the name. If I wanted to go back to origins of Vim I can simply type B ori and I would switch to origins of Vim. So a few moments before I showed you the B next command there's also the B previous command that you can use to switch to the previous buffer in the list and let's list out the buffers again You can also switch to the first or the last buffer in this list with two commands these commands are b first this is now switched to the first buffer in the list with the first index and We can also use the last go to the last buffer in the list you can also close buffers without closing them. For that we can use the bd command. So bd followed by an index or whatever. Let's close the one with the first index that was the CLI tool replacement one. So just use index one. And now if we list the buffers again, we see we only have two buffers open and the CLI tool replacements are just gone from here. We can also create a new file which is also loaded into a buffer even if it's not written on disk yet. So let's use e for that. E new buffer text. Now we also have this buffer open. Let's list it out. We see this buffer has the index 4 now. So buffer indices are always unique across sessions. So let's talk about something that tripped me up a little bit when I discovered buffers and switching between them let me show you we're gonna add a line here like and subscribe always Have a really great line to add to some files and to talk to about in these videos I think and now let's go back to normal mode let's try to switch a buffer now let's just write the end for be Next now if you look at the bottom of the screen here we get this error 37 no write since last change so by default vim is configured in a way that it doesn't allow for changing to another Buffer if you have changes on the current buffer and didn't write them to disk yet there are a few things you can do about this first thing is of course write the changes to the file and then You could switch so let's try this first so we're going to write and now if we do bn for buffer next we can switch to the other buffer let's switch back again with ctrl caret so let's make Another change here thank you and now if you want to switch again it won't work again right so let's try it again just to that you see that it still doesn't work so if we try to switch we see This error again so let's try a different way here we could use bn again and then we could force it with the exclamation mark it's a force operator here in vim so let's try this and you see We could switch this way no problem let's switch back again what you can also do is set an option for this you can set the option hidden this option allows you to switch to different buffers Even if the current buffer you're on is not written to this get so let's try again switching bn and this time it works like a charm without problem so this option i always set in my config File i think in new vim this is also the default actually. Let's check. So this page actually tells you about the differences between new vim and vim. If we scroll down a little bit we see some defaults are different than the configuration options in vim and one of these options is this hidden. This is enabled by default so in new vim you won't run into this problem. ([Time 0:01:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ba8d0f82-b2c5-4f28-907f-94423e2a90a8))

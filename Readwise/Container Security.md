## Highlights
- Risks, Threats, and Mitigations A risk is a potential problem, and the effects of that problem if it were to occur. A threat is a path to that risk occurring. A mitigation is a countermeasure against a threat — something you can do to prevent the threat or at least reduce the likelihood of its success.

- For more on threat models in Kubernetes deployments, you may be interested in reading the Kubernetes Threat Model commissioned by the CNCF. In addition, the CNCF’s Financial User Group has published a Kubernetes Attack Tree created using the STRIDE methodology.

- Application containers in Kubernetes pods that happen to be running on the same host are protected from each other only by container isolation, as described in this book, even if they are in different namespaces. If an attacker can escape a container to the host, the Kubernetes namespace boundary makes not one jot of difference to their ability to affect other containers.

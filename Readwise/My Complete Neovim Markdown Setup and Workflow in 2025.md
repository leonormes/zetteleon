## Highlights
- **Setting Up Keybindings for Jumping to Daily Notes**
  The presenter uses the command **hyper tr** to create or jump to daily notes. 
  - This is mapped to a key binding, **"hyper"**, which is part of his custom keymaps for quick access. 
  - **Hyper** is a prefix key that combines multiple sublayers, like **T** for Tmux sessions and **R** for apps. 
  - To jump to daily notes, he presses **hyper tr**. 
  - He also mentions using **space E** to access mini.files, which can be used to open or create daily notes based on his setup. 
  **Additional Details:** 
  - The **hyper** prefix is configured to work across different layers for efficient navigation. 
  - The setup is part of his custom keymaps, which include other shortcuts for productivity workflows.

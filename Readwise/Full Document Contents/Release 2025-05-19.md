Announcements

Customers using Azure Linux 2.0 should migrate to Azure Linux 3.0 before November 2025. For details on how to migrate from Azure Linux 2.0 to Azure Linux 3.0, see this doc. AKS is currently working on a feature to allow for migrations between Azure Linux 2.0 and Azure Linux 3.0 through a node pool update command. For updates on feature progress and availability, see Github issue.
Starting in June 2025, AKS clusters with version >= 1.28 and using Azure Linux 2.0 can be opted into Long Term Support.
Starting in June 2025, Azure Kubernetes Service will begin rolling out a change to enable quota for all current and new AKS customers. AKS quota will represent a limit of the maximum number of managed clusters that an Azure subscription can consume per region. Existing AKS customer subscriptions will be given a quota limit at or above their current usage, depending on region availability. Once quota is enabled, customers can view their available quota and request quota increases in the Quotas page in the Azure Portal or by using the Quotas REST API. For details on how to view and request quota increases via the Portal Quotas page, visit Azure Quotas. For details on how to view and request quota increases via the Quotas REST API, visit: Azure Quota REST API Reference. New AKS customer subscriptions will be given a default limit upon new subscription creation. More information on the default limits for new subscriptions is available in documentation here.
Starting on 17 June 2025, AKS will no longer create new node images for Ubuntu 18.04 or provide security updates. Existing node images will be deleted. Your node pools will be unsupported and you will no longer be able to scale. To avoid service disruptions, scaling restrictions, and remain supported, please follow our instructions to upgrade to a supported Kubernetes version.

##### Announcements

* Customers using Azure Linux 2.0 should migrate to Azure Linux 3.0 before November 2025. For details on how to migrate from Azure Linux 2.0 to Azure Linux 3.0, see this [doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-linux/how-to-enable-azure-linux-3). AKS is currently working on a feature to allow for migrations between Azure Linux 2.0 and Azure Linux 3.0 through a node pool update command. For updates on feature progress and availability, see Github [issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4987).
* Starting in June 2025, AKS clusters with version >= 1.28 and using Azure Linux 2.0 can be opted into [Long Term Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/long-term-support).
* Starting in June 2025, Azure Kubernetes Service will begin rolling out a change to enable quota for all current and new AKS customers. AKS quota will represent a limit of the maximum number of managed clusters that an Azure subscription can consume per region. Existing AKS customer subscriptions will be given a quota limit at or above their current usage, depending on region availability. Once quota is enabled, customers can view their available quota and request quota increases in the Quotas page in the Azure Portal or by using the Quotas REST API. For details on how to view and request quota increases via the Portal Quotas page, visit [Azure Quotas](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quotas/view-quotas). For details on how to view and request quota increases via the Quotas REST API, visit: [Azure Quota REST API Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/reserved-vm-instances/quotaapi). New AKS customer subscriptions will be given a default limit upon new subscription creation. More information on the default limits for new subscriptions is available in documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits).
* Starting on 17 June 2025, AKS will no longer create new node images for [Ubuntu 18.04](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4873) or provide security updates. Existing node images will be deleted. Your node pools will be unsupported and you will no longer be able to scale. To avoid service disruptions, scaling restrictions, and remain supported, please follow our instructions to [upgrade](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster?tabs=azure-cli) to a [supported Kubernetes version](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions).
* [Teleport (preview)](https://github.com/Azure/acr/blob/main/docs/teleport/aks-getting-started.md) on AKS will be retired on 15 July 2025, please [migrate to Artifact Streaming (preview) on AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/artifact-streaming) or update your node pools to set --aks-custom-headers EnableACRTeleport=false. Azure Container Registry has removed the Teleport API meaning that any nodes with Teleport enabled are pulling images from Azure Container Registry as any other AKS node. After 15 July 2025, any node pools with Teleport (preview) enabled may experience breakage and node provisioning failures. For more information, see [aka.ms/aks/teleport-retirement](https://aka.ms/aks/teleport-retirement).
* Azure Kubernetes Service will no longer support the --skip-gpu-driver-install node pool tag to skip automatic driver installation. Starting on August 14 2025, you will no longer be able to use this node pool tag at AKS node pool creation time to install custom GPU drivers or use the GPU Operator. Alternatively, you should use the generally available gpu-driver API field to update your existing node pools or create new GPU-enabled node pools to [skip automatic GPU driver installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/gpu-cluster?tabs=add-ubuntu-gpu-node-pool#skip-gpu-driver-installation-preview).

##### Release Notes

* Preview Features

	+ For clusters with [Layer 7 policies with Advanced Container Networking Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/how-to-apply-l7-policies?tabs=cilium) enabled, a new metric [proxy\_datapath\_update\_timeout\_total](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/observability/metrics/#policy-l7-http-kafka-fqdn) has been introduced in disabled by default mode.
* Features

	+ Kubernetes 1.31 and 1.32 are now designated as [Long-Term Support (LTS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/long-term-support) versions.
	+ [Kubernetes 1.33](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/23/kubernetes-v1-33-release/) is available in Preview. A full matrix of supported add-ons and components is published at the [AKS versions page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-cli#kubernetes-1330).
	+ AKS now allows [upgrading](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-azure-cni#node-subnet-cluster-upgrade) from Azure CNI NodeSubnet to Azure CNI NodeSubnet with Cilium dataplane, and from Azure CNI NodeSubnet with Cilium dataplane to Azure CNI Overlay with Cilium dataplane.
* Bug Fixes

	+ Fixed failures triggered by duplicate [tag keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-tags) that differed only by character case.
* Behavior Changes

	+ Static egress gateway memory limits increased from 128Mi to 500Mi for greater stability.
	+ Memory for Azure Monitor Container Insights container `ama-logs` increased from `750Mi` to `1Gi`.
	+ AKS nodes now use **Azure Container Registry (ACR)-scoped Entra ID tokens** for kubelet authentication when pulling images from ACR. This enhancement replaces the legacy ARM-based Entra token model, aligning with modern security practices by scoping credentials directly to the registry and improving isolation and traceability.
	+ Timeouts due to FQDN IP updates are exported by Cilium Agent as [cilium\_proxy\_datapath\_update\_timeout\_total](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/observability/metrics/#policy-l7-http-kafka-fqdn) on Azure CNI Powered by Cilium.
	+ ARM requests made with an api-version >= `2025-03-01` to obtain the status of async AKS operations can now return RP-defined status values for ongoing operations. Requests made with an api-version < `2025-03-01` will only return an `InProgress` status for ongoing operations.

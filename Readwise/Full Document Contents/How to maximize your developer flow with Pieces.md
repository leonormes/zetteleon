Every modern dev stack is a mosaic of tools: IDEs, CLIs, browsers, docs, tickets, and chats. The friction is not that we *lack* information, it’s that we drown in it, and we have to rebuild working memory whenever we switch tasks. Pieces starts from a simple thesis: **context, not code, is the bottleneck.** If you remove the toil of chasing breadcrumbs, your work accelerates.

That’s why Pieces invests in a **local-first** substrate (PiecesOS), a **Long-Term Memory (LTM-2.5) engine** to remember your work across sessions, **Pieces Drive** to store and enrich artifacts, and an **AI Copilot** that sits on top of your context rather than ignoring it. The result is not just an assistant that answers questions but a a companion that **remembers with you**.

This article is a practical guide, summarizing best practices by our team, to maximize Pieces across your daily flow, Desktop, IDEs, web, and terminal, grounded in the latest documentation and real-world patterns.

We’ll close with **10 specific ways** to squeeze more value from day one.

#### What you need to know about Pieces before getting started

PiecesOS is the background service that orchestrates on-device processing, storage, and ML inference for the suite. Think of it as your **context engine**: it indexes and enriches what you save, runs local models (via [**Ollama**](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/ollama)) when you want offline or private inference, and exposes APIs (e.g., MCP) that other tools can tap. Practically speaking, that means your snippets, embeddings, [LTM memory,](https://pieces.app/features/long-term-memory) and [Copilot](https://pieces.app/features/copilot) history live on your machine, with cloud features being **opt-in** rather than the default. For enterprises or heavy travelers, this matters, your assistant remains useful on bad Wi-Fi, and your data sovereignty is straightforward.

The [privacy & security](https://docs.pieces.app/products/privacy-security-your-data) posture follows logically: the system is local-first and offline-capable; telemetry is controlled; and when you do enable cloud features, infrastructure is built for isolation and audited (e.g., SOC-2). If you share a snippet from [Drive](https://pieces.app/features/drive), **secret detection** helps prevent accidental credential leaks. These are not nice-to-haves, they’re enabling constraints that make you *trust* your assistant.

##### The brain: LTM-2.5 and Workstream context

Most copilots are brilliant goldfish: they dazzle, then forget. **LTM-2.5** flips that script by explicitly remembering your workflow, content you read, code you save, commits you make, discussions you reference so you can ask better questions later. In practical terms, [Quick Guides](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/ltm-context) show how to grab context from a webpage or document, then query Copilot: `“what did you see?”` The answer arrives grounded in the artifacts you were just working with. Over time, that becomes a long-view memory of your projects, bugs, and decisions.

What makes this powerful is not just recall, but **retrieval**: LTM is searchable, and your Copilot can use it to tie together disparate threads (`“the error from last week’s Slack mention”` + `“the closed GitHub issue from last month”)`.

##### The hands: Pieces Copilot, Desktop, and Drive

The [**Desktop App**](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop) is your command center: a clean space to search, chat with Copilot, and manage your Drive. You can tweak **Views & Layouts**, select a **default search mode** (e.g., Neural Code Search), and decide how the UI behaves.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/25L2t1Y4bgl2yZfTtEQjSTz50I.gif?width=960&height=589)
Copilot can run on **cloud** or **local models** depending on the task, latency, and privacy needs; the [desktop surfaces those choices](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/navigation/settings) right where you work. On Windows/macOS, install flows are straightforward; Linux leans on snaps for PiecesOS + app.

[**Pieces Drive**](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/drive) is your personal, rich library. It stores code and text with syntax highlighting, tags, and annotations; when you share, you’ll get a secure, readable view. It’s a surprisingly delightful way to build the “second brain” devs talk about, without losing detail or structure.

##### The bridges: MCP, IDEs, Web Extension, and CLI

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started) connects LLMs to tools and data, allowing Pieces to feed *your* context into the agents you already like using. The docs include [prompting examples](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/prompting) (`“what version did Mark ask me to update?`” then apply it to `package.json`) and walk through integrations like [Cursor](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started), including a local SSE endpoint format exposed by PiecesOS. This is the connective tissue that keeps your AI useful across environments.

In [VS Code](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code) and [JetBrains](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains), you get inline Copilot with LTM context. That means you can weave prior commits, notes, and recently read materials into queries without copy-pasting. The Web Extension makes capturing from the browser trivial; [JupyterLab](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jupyterlab) shows how Drive fits into data science notebooks. If you prefer the terminal, [the CLI](https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli) lets you create, search, and manage snippets from your shell and even swap the Copilot model the same way you switch Python venvs.

Finally, models: you can [mix cloud LLMs](https://docs.pieces.app/products/large-language-models) (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) and local models served by Ollama. If you need snappy, private iteration, pick a local model; if you need best-in-class reasoning or code understanding, switch to a premium cloud model. Pieces Pro unlocks a broader catalog and speed/accuracy perks. The key insight: model choice is a workflow decision, not a global setting.

Here are some other ways you can use Pieces to maximize your experience.

#### Make LTM your default habit

Don’t save “only the final solution.” Save *the trail*: a key forum answer, the architectural diagram you skimmed, that Slack thread that resolved a debate. Use the [Web Extension](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/get-started) or [IDE plugins](https://pieces.app/plugins) to capture on the fly; then ask Copilot to summarize `“what did we read and decide?”` You’re building future leverage, tomorrow-you will thank today-you

#### Ask Copilot about *your* work, not generic code

Copilot is most effective when it’s pointed at your context. Use prompts that reference LTM `(“Based on the doc I saved earlier”` or `“Generate a stantup styled summary of my work today”)`. The [LTM Prompting Guide](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/ltm-prompting) offers patterns, adopt them until it’s muscle memory.

#### Capture decisions, not just snippets, in Drive

When you store a code fragment, add a one-line rationale and a tag (“hot path,” “security,” “migration-v2”). Over time, Drive becomes a decision log with runnable examples, not a pastebin. [Sharing is safe](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/drive/sharing), Pieces warns about detected secrets and lets you mark sensitive strings.

#### Treat model selection like choosing the right tool

Use local models for quick, private, iterative edits; switch to a premium cloud model for heavyweight refactors or deep explanations. Different environments (Desktop, Web Extension, JetBrains, [CLI](https://docs.pieces.app/products/cli)) expose simple model switching, use it often. This is the single fastest way to balance speed, cost, and quality.

#### Wire up MCP where you actually work

If you’re in Cursor (or another MCP-aware tool), plug in the Pieces MCP SSE endpoint and start prompting with *your* context. The move from `“ask + paste”` to `“ask with context attached”` is night and day. Keep a cheatsheet of [MCP prompts](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/prompting) you like, e.g., `“apply the requested version update to package.json.”`

#### Curate your Desktop Settings like you curate your dotfiles

Set a default Layout that matches your mental model, and pick a default search mode (e.g., Neural Code Search) that aligns with how you recall work. Small preference tweaks, big daily wins. Revisit [settings monthly](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/navigation/settings); your habits will evolve.

#### Keep installation tidy and versions current

Use the recommended installers (macOS/Windows) or snaps on Linux to reduce drift. When running into weird behavior, check the [cross-platform troubleshooting](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/troubleshooting) and the PiecesOS storage/log paths; 90% of “it’s haunted” bugs are fixable with a clean, updated stack and clarity on where the data lives.

#### Make the CLI a first-class citizen

Save and retrieve snippets without leaving your terminal, then jump to Desktop for richer context or sharing. If you already maintain a dotfiles repo, add a couple of helper aliases for `pieces create`, `pieces search`, and model switching. This keeps your flow uninterrupted.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/xv8XeDjKtbJlh1SJ3ZfYP55UL1c.gif?width=960&height=540)
#### Establish a “privacy posture” and revisit it

Default local-first and offline when you’re dealing with sensitive code; enable cloud features for collaboration or premium models when the task calls for it. Use telemetry/controls intentionally, and communicate expectations with your team. Trust compounds.

#### Invest in prompt hygiene, once. Reuse forever

Collect prompts that consistently produce the right actions (e.g., “`Diff this snippet against the one I saved last week,” “Summarize the doc I captured and propose a test plan`”). Add a short library of “Pieces-aware” prompts to your knowledge base or dotfiles so teammates benefit immediately.

#### Flow through your day with fewer context switches

Here’s a concrete rhythm that folds the ten practices together:

* **Morning pull-up:** Open Desktop, scan Drive’s recent items, and ask Copilot for a quick summary of yesterday’s Workstream activity. Skim for risks or dangling threads. (If you’re in the browser, the Web Extension can capture new docs you’ll need later.)
* **Coding focus:** In VS Code or JetBrains, keep Copilot docked and LTM on. When you touch a tricky area, ask, `“have we seen similar errors?”` or `“does the last migration pattern apply here?”` Swap models if you need deep reasoning.
* **Terminal sprints:** Save quick snippets via CLI, setup commands, one-liners, SQL fragments, then tag them. Later, ask Copilot to reconcile your terminal lore with repo history.
* **Review & share:** Use Drive’s sharing with secret checks when circulating examples. If the team uses Cursor, plug in MCP so your context accompanies the request.
* **End-of-day sweep:** Capture the issue summary you closed, the doc you read, and the commit rationale. Future-you eliminates rediscovery time tomorrow.

#### What about cost, speed, and “which model should I use?”

Treat models like you treat databases: fit for purpose (no need to burn tokens when you can do [smaller tasks](https://pieces.app/blog/nano-models)).

Use a fast, local model while iterating tight loops (rename vars, stub tests, small refactors). Switch to a premium cloud model for gnarly debugging, codegen with many moving parts, or architectural justifications.

If your org uses [Pieces Pro](https://docs.pieces.app/products/more-pieces/paid-plans), encourage teammates to adopt the same “switch often” culture so answers stay consistent across environments. The point is not to pick a winner, it’s to pick the **right** model for the **current** problem.

#### The bottom line

With Pieces, you’re not teaching an assistant *what* to know every time, you’re teaching it **what to remember**. That difference compounds: a week of captured context becomes a month of better recall, a month becomes a quarter of faster decision-making. The ten practices above aren’t theory, they’re a way to make the invisible glue of software work, context, visible, searchable, and collaborative.

If you adopt just three habits: **capture everything into LTM**, **prompt Copilot against your own context**, and **switch models deliberately**, you’ll feel the compounding effect within a few days.

Add MCP and CLI as your bridges, and you’ve got a personal platform that travels with you from browser to IDE to terminal. It’s time to [try Pieces!](https://pieces.app/)

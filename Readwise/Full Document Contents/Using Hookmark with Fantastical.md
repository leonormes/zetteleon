##### Copy Link, Copy Markdown Link and Hook to Copied Link

When you use Hookmark’s `Copy Link` and `Copy Markdown Link` in the context of Fantastical, you get a native Fantastical link whose URL is `x-fantastical`.

Here’s an example Markdown URL to a Fantastical date: `x-fantastical://show?item=226CE2D7-2757-4FBB-8CC1-B85F9B71BD6A&calendarIdentifier=3C8C2A71-84BF-4C87-8EFD-BB4827650D16`

You can of course paste your links to Fantastical events anywhere, such as your task lists, notes, reminders, etc. You can use these links on all your synced devices (Mac, iPhone, iPad and Windows) even if Hookmark is not installed on them.

##### Use cases

Important meetings are typically related to your projects, contacts and other information on your Mac. So you need to be able to quickly navigate between that information, without searching. Use Hookmark to connect your calendar entries to:

* project information (e.g., in Merlin Project, OmniFocus or Things)
* meeting agenda
* past meeting minutes
* contact information of the person you’re meeting with
* Zoom, Google or other video session information
* other pertinent information

There are countless ways in which linking your calendar entries can be helpful.

##### Search for Fantastical bookmarks in Hookmark

Whenever you copy links in Hookmark, Hookmark creates a bookmark for you. So you can quickly find your Fantastical bookmarks in Hookmark as follows:

1. Invoke Hookmark’s contextual window (`⌃H`).
2. Enter search mode (with ⌘F or a click).
3. Type: `"x-fantastical"` and hit the Return key.

Your Fantastical bookmarks will show up in the search results.

You can use the wildcard character (`*`) in step 3 to shorten your search string, such as `x-fant*`.

See Hookmark’s [help page on searching](https://hookproductivity.com/help/hook-window/search/) for more information.

With Hookmark’s search, within a few keystrokes you can find the relevant meeting you are looking for. Unlike other search tools, Hookmark is optimized to only show you information to which you have copied links. That turns out to be an excellent signal of relevance that leaves out noisy information.

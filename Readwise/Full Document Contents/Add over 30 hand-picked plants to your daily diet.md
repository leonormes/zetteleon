Is Daily30+ the most scientific way to feed your gut? Our scientists believe it is. Why? Because we ran our own randomised controlled trial to check if it worked — the results blew us away and helped us create the formulation we sell today.

Elevating real over artificial ingredients, our scientists carefully selected each plant to create a formula of over 30 diverse fibers that support your gut health\*, improve digestion\*, and increase energy\*\*

Contains: chaga, cordyceps, lions mane, maitake, reishi, shiitake, tremella and white

Contains: chia seed, flaxseed, grape seed, hemp seed, pumpkin seed, and sunflower seed

Yes, it is completely vegan, with no added salt or sugar. It is also a source of plant protein and omega-3. Daily30+ is gluten-free and made in a gluten-free facility so there is no risk of cross-contamination.

While we try to source organic ingredients, this is not always possible for some of the plants in Daily30+, either because there is not a reliable source of organic options or because these options are not as high-quality.

We are constantly working to improve the organic makeup of our product. Our ingredients are sourced to be of the highest quality, and all our suppliers must comply with strict sustainability standards.

Our randomised control trial (RCT) was done as part of the development process for Daily30+ and we have since made some small changes. This means the results apply to a slightly different recipe than the one we currently sell, but we think the changes we have made make it even better! We will be retesting again later this year.

BIOME was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 399 people, with the final analysis on 349 people over 6 weeks. Participants were all healthy, 76% women, 24% men with a mean age 51 years recruited from the ZOE Health Study. The study had 3 arms: a functional control arm: consumed bread croutons (28g/day), intervention 1: consumed Daily30+ (30g/day i.e. 2 scoops) and intervention 2: took a daily probiotic (1 capsule/day).

We have added North Atlantic seaweed into Daily30+ as it is a naturally rich source of calcium. We have also removed the carrot and beetroot. We were not happy with the consistent quality of these two ingredients so are looking for a new supplier.

\* Gut health & digestion: Daily30+ is a natural source of calcium. Calcium contributes to the normal function of digestive enzymes.

\*\* Energy: Daily30+ is a natural source of copper, which contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism and the normal function of the immune system.

\*\*\* High in fibre and a source of calcium, copper, omega-3s and plant protein.

*Supplements should not be used as a substitute for a varied diet. Please use Daily30+ as part of a healthy lifestyle. Do not exceed the stated, recommended daily dose (15g).*

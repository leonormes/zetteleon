How to use a REM node for beginners. Hey everyone, in this video I'm going to walk you through Remnote, the all-in-one tool that combines note-taking and space repetition. Whether you're a student or professional or trying to master complex information, Remnote has something for you. By the end of this video, you will know exactly how to sign up, create effective notes, turn them into flashcard, and use them spared repetition system to actually remember what you study. So let's get started. 

Before we deep dive into the video, let's understand what is REM. So basically a REM is just a smart bullet point. It can be a simple note, a question and answer, a tag or folder for organizing other node. You can connect your ideas like a web using tags and back links. You can use flashcard. You can use hierarchy in the nodes customization. You will get lot of option in RAM node. So let's get 

started. Sign up. So first thing first what you have to do is just come on this website which is RAM note and then click on the RAM note for free and then it will ask you to sign up. Just simply click on the Google or email if you have just simply give all the access. Once you are in you will land on the home dashboard. This is your base of everything. Let's understand this dashboard. What are the feature and what you can access from here. So first we 

will start with this. At the top we can see the user profile name and author. And then we have settings. This is where you can configure your account setting including your profile, theme and other uh preferences like notification setting and app integration. Now the second one is upgrade. From here you can buy uh a plan from here if you want. This is import. This option allows you to import document, flashcard or notes from other 

sources or platforms. It is useful if you are migrating content from apps like Anki, notion or even a node from this RAM node then it is useful for you. This is MCA. It's like it seems like a specific collection or folder possibly tailored for MCAT related study notes. You can create custom folder to group your notes. So this could be a a workspace or subject area dedicated to 

MCAT preparation. Now this is a group. This might represent shared node group or study group within the remn where you can collab with collaborate with others. You can organize notes by group or topics helping your track shared project or collaborative learning. Now these are some basic feature or uh options over here. This is the trash where something if you delete something in the remode then it will appear over here. So that was the basic of uh this dashboard. Now 

let's move through this dashboard. This is a main navigation, all notes, today not flashcard. And let's understand what is this. Now this is a search bar. Uh the search bar allows you to quickly search for specific notes or documents within the Rev Note. You can search for keywords and tags and folders, source, a lot of option, daily notes. Yeah, you can search with the filter as well. Now 

let's move to the all note where you can uh this all note is the first section showing an overall list of documents or notes in your RAM note workspace. Clicking on this will display every document you have created or organized into folder and subfolders. Now as you can see let's move to today's nodes. This section is where you where your daily uh notes are stored. You can access your notes for the current day 

directly and it helps you to quickly jot down ideas or reflection without navigating through your entire folder. Let's move to flashcard. Flash card is uh this shows a badge with the number one as you can see here uh indicating that there is one flash card that needs to review. But yeah uh by clicking on the flash card it will take you to your study query where you can review and 

study flashcard that have been scheduled for today via space repetition as you can see here. Now let's move this is MCAT uh this is all related to study I guess. Now let's switch to import from an or switch from an guide. This might be a guide or folder to help user transition from Anki to Remnote including tips, resources or tutorial on how to import your Anki flashcard and notes into 

remnot. Now this is a import from Anki. It's basically this section allows you to import notes from Anki into Remnote. Anki users can migrate their text into Remnote for enhancing their note takingaking and study features. Now this is a AI learning tool. Uh this section likely includes AI powered study tools integrated with RAM node such as smart suggestion autogenerating flashcard or lot of as you can see PDF to card any 

source to card. You can create a lot of flash card over here. Now let's move to create. This is where you can create a new document or new folder. As you can see, you can upload and annotate a file. You can upload your source file as well from here. So yeah, that's it for the dashboard. First, let's create a simple note from here. So in order to do that, 

what you have to do is just simply click on the create button and it will ask you to create a folder or document. So if you create a folder then it will uh basically it will create a separate folder where you can add your documents or you can create notes for that folder. So I will just simply go with the documents. Now over here you can give a name for example first document and then over here you can choose bullet notes, note bullets or 

to-do list. So this is a basic uh card. If I add so this is like a create a card for example what is my name then give to is equal to and it will make this arrow then press tab so it's like autofilling as well right now my name is so yeah so for example you can create 

notes but you can ask ution over here as well. So this is a basic creating document. Now let's create a folder. Just click on the folder and from here you can create a folder for college and then if you want to create a subfolder into your folder just simply click on it. It will create a subfolder. Now hit enter and then as you can see there is a option of create 

a document where you can create a documents in that folder. Now let's understand the rims and hierarch hierarchical structure. So basically a remnot uses something called rims. These are individual units of information like a bullet point. They can be nested to create a hierarchy. For example, we will create a new document. Just simply give the name which is rem just for this tutorial and let's create a bullet point. Now type a line and hit enter. 

For example, what is my name? And then hit the enter button and click on the tab. It will make a nested or it make a child bullet of this bullet point. So, so this is how you can make a child of your main bullet point. Then you can uh of course you can make child of the child as well. For example, my name is nothing and then click on the enter and again click on the tab. So here we go. 

We have successfully created a nested uh child into the child. So this is a parent child structure is great for breaking down complex topics or if you don't know like let's say uh I'm making again let's say I am uh let's add one more text over here now I what I will do I will do uh what is this then I will uh for example 

you have added a complex word over here let's say this is a complex word. Then if you want to add the definition of that uh specific word, what you can do is just simply hit enter and click on the tab and you can add the description over here. So this is how it works. You can use folder for broad subject and use intended trends to group related ideas. Use the search bar to find anything even buried deep in your notes. This is where the search comes here. So you can use 

search as well to find your notes or find your bullet point. Now let's create a flash card. In the left side you will get the option of flash card. So if you don't know what is flash card, so basically flash card is rem not uh uh like designed to help you to actively recall and retain information using space repetition. Remnote makes flashcard creation seamless by integrating it directly into your note takingaking process. 

So now let's get started. So first thing like unlike traditional flashc card apps like remnotes lets you to create take notes and create flashc card simultaneously you can organize them in two hierarchical way. You can review them with the smarter scheduling. Now how to create a flash card in remnot just simply click on the flash card and then from here what you can do uh either you can create from here basic card or just simply go into 

flashc card and click on the practice with a specic repetition. Just simply click on it. Now over here you will get to see create more flashcard option. Just simply click on it. Now over here you can see there is a option like here you have to add front of card and then back of the card. So like first is a basic I will uh tell you how you can create a basic flash card. So what you have to do left in the left side uh you 

have to add a question like for example what is uh mistaken what is okay what is my name and then give two is equal to and then you can add answer over here like my name is 

rocket. Now when you review the question appears first and you try to recall the answer. So let's give a practice. Click on it and then whenever you see this card you will get the uh question uh like what is my name and you are going to like what is my name? You will think about that question and if you figure out then click on the show answer. If you don't remember or just simply if you if you honestly if you recall that question's answer then you can click on 

this easily recall. If you don't then just simply click on the forget. So it will work like this. Now you can you can create bid reactional flash card. So how it works is like you can create two flash cards front uh and reverse. just uh do let's do an example for example uh we have two flash card over here like what is my name and then I will give the answer again what is it's like you can 

create two flash card into one for example in the front what you are going to do is add the answer of that specific question then Type this symbol and then add the powerhouse of cell then click on the hit enter like add one more. So this is we have created. Now 

let's click on that again. Then you have to give a reverse that. Now add the first last line of that that card power house of the cell. Then click on it. Give the answer of that question. And yeah, here we go. And click on this Q flash card here. As you can see, we have a question uh answer. And then we will remember the question. 

Click on it. Then you have the question. Now if you uh partially recall then again there we go. So this is useful memorizing definitions, formulas or association. Now these are some ways. This is how you can create flashc card. Uh there are lot of ways you can do that. Uh let's click on the add uh notes. You can add this is our first which we have created some flashcard over here. Now let's get back to the flash card and as you can see here this 

says now if you want to add practice click on it. Now you will remember the answer of this question. If you give the right answer then click on the easily recalled. If you don't forget about the answer just simply click on the forget. So this is how it works. It's very easy and uh very productive to remember everything about formulas to answer of the specific question. you can create flashc card. So yeah, now let's say if 

you want to add nodes, just simply click on the create nodes. If you want to create folder from here, you can create it. Uh I will go with the document. From here you can as I said I have already created a note. So you can add that specific name of your node and then uh click on generate card from notes. So this is how it works. Uh so that's it. Uh uh this is a complete tutorial how you can use uh RAM 

node. It's very easy and very beginner friendly. If you learned something new, like and subscribe and comment below with what topics you want to build in remote note.

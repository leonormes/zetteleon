## Full Document
Hey, what's up guys? Spacebar here.Today, I just wanted to make a video onhow you can jailbreak your Kindle.There are various reasons you'd want to do that.One of the biggest advantages isthat you can natively use e-pubs on yourKindle, and then you can really customizethe UI and use something calledKoreader. So your actual bookreading experience will be far morecustomizable.

Okay, so the first thing that we're going to need to do is grabyour Kindle, turn it on airplanemode, and then plug it into yourcomputer, whether it's Mac or Windows.This tutorial is going to be followingme on a Windows computer, but it willwork for Mac as well.

Okay, so we're on the computer now, and what we're goingto need to do is head over to thisGitHub link. Um, again, there will be alink in the description, but if you want totype it in manually, it'sgithub.com/kindlemoding/winterbreak.

This is the actual jailbreak we’re going to need to download.So we will head over to the releases section and wewill just download whatever is thelatest release.

First, we will get the tar.gzfile and then we will head over to ourdownloads. We will open this, and wewill actually—let's extract this.We'll just right-click, extract, andwe're going to put it in the winterbreak folder. So, it's been extracted toour downloads. Now, we're going to openour Kindle up. And what we're going todo is take the mosquitofolder, the apps folder, basically everythingbesides the .githuband the readme. Um, make sure that youcan see these hidden files. They have a periodin the start of the file name. Ifyou can't see those, click view, show,

and hidden items. If you don't have thaton, you're not going to be able to seethem probably. Um, so, and I think onMac, there's a keyboard shortcut, whichI will also put on the screen. Um, soanyway, we're going to drag theseover to our Kindle's root directory. So,that is if you go to your Kindleand go as far out as you can. So, likethis PC Kindle, it's the furthestout. Okay. So, now that we've draggedthe files onto the device, all we'regoing to do is unplug it and then we'reGoing to reboot it. Make sure toensure that your airplane mode is on.

That is incredibly important. This isn'tgoing to work if you turn off theairplane mode. So, we're going to holddown the powerbutton and then we're going to restartthe Kindle. Okay. So, our Kindle hasrebooted and now what we need to do islaunch the Kindle store. We can eitherdo that by clicking on any of thediscover books that are not alreadydownloaded on the device or you canclick up here on the cart. So, I'm goingto click thecart. It's going to tell you that you needto turn on Wi-Fi basically and it'sgoing to ask if you want to turnairplane mode off. So, we're going toclickyes. Okay. Okay. So then it's going topop up with this screen that you'veprobably never seen before. What we'regoing to do is we're going to click thiswinter breakicon. So now we are actuallyjailbreaking the device. We just have towait a few seconds and you can seehere it's finished installing. Um, I gotconfused the first time I did this.

You can now disregard the thing that sayswait. Uh, it just says, "Please install thehot fix now." So we're going to move onto actually installing the hot fix onthe device. Okay, so we're on thecomputer now. I just wanted to explainwhat the hot fix actually does. Um, soas of now, if you were to install anupdate on your Kindle or restart it, youwill lose jailbreak. Um, so if youhave experienced jailbreakingiPhones, that would be considered likean untethered jailbreak. Um, in atethered jailbreak, you'd be able toactually reboot the device. So, uh, whatwe're going to do is we're going toinstall this hot fix. We're going to

head over to this GitHub link, which is,of course, in the description. Uh, we'regoing to head over to thereleases, and we're going to download theupdate hotfix universal bin. Okay, sowe're going to go back to our Kindle'sroot directory as we did before, andwe're going to take this file and we'rejust going to drop it on the Kindle.Okay, so you guys can go ahead andunplug your Kindle. So we are going togo over tosettings and then we're going to go toDeviceoptions and then software updates.

So then, we're going to click the updatebutton. We're going to wait a littlewhile for it to actually work. And nowyour Kindle is going to reboot andinstall the new update. It should gopretty quick because it's a prettysmall file. Okay, so our Kindle hasturned back on and now we should see abook called run hot fix. So whatwe're going to do is we're going toclick that and you'll only need to dothis one time ever. You will never haveto do it again. Okay, so the Kindle hasturned back on. We are now officiallyjailbroken and we have installed the hot

fix that'll prevent the jailbreak fromgoing away. What we need to do now isactually install a package manager and alauncher. So the launcher will basicallyallow you to launch any other mods youdownload. So in this example,it's going to be co-reader. So toactually get to co-reader, we'll need todownload the launcher. This will allow youto use both a default Kindle experienceand use your standard AW books, use theKindle store, all that as well as usingco-reader and using ePubs.

Switching to it entirely if you want,but it's always going to be completelyreversible. Um, so we're going to do itthis way. So, what we've got to do is wehave to plug back in the Kindle, and we'regoing to install two different packages.So, I will see you guys on the computer.Okay, so we're back on the computer.We've got to install two differentthings. The first thing is going to becalledMRPI, which I have no idea what itstands for, but it's something packageinstaller. Um, and then Kool. Kal is thelauncher that we're going to be using.Um, so we're going to scroll down here.Here is Kuall. Uh, make sure we do theC-plate one. This is going to be for allof your common newer Kindles. And sojust click this right here, and it'lldownload that file. Okay, so we've gotthe Kalplate version downloaded on thecomputer. And we also need to install

this MR package installer. So, we'regoing to click that as well. Okay. So,the first thing we're going to do isinstall MRPI. So, we're going toright-click the MRPI installer, um, zippedfile, and we're going to extractthat. So, once you've done that, you'reWe're going to click both of these folders andyou're going to drag them onto yourKindle. And then we're going to move onto installing Koal. Okay. Okay, so Ijust wanted to have a quick note. Um,there's this guide that I've beenfollowing along with on here and I'mgoing to link it in the description, um,to give a little bit of credit, but I dowant to let you guys know that it'spretty out of date, and if you try to useit for the installing Koal section, it'snot going to work properly. Um, so youguys will need to do what I'm doing inthis video instead of following this.

So, what we're going to do instead ofwhat they're suggesting is we're goingto take this update Koalbooklet\_hotfix file and we're going todrop it on the root directory of ourKindle. Okay, so the Kindle's unplugged.Once again, we're going to go tosettings,device, softwareupdates,update again. This should be prettyquick. Your Kindle is going to reboot,so it's going to take a while to turnback on because they're slow. Okay, soour Kindle has turned back on, and whatWe can see now that we have anothernew book. It's called Kool. And this ishow we're actually going to launchstuff. So again, there is no need to click therun hotfix anymore. You can totallyignore that. You might even be able tohide it. If we click the Kal button,this is actually going to be ourlauncher where we're going to be able tolaunch KoReader and any otherapplications that we install. Currently,we have nothing installed, so the onlyoptions are Kowal helper and quit.

What we're going to do is exit out of that, and then we're going toget into actually installing KoReader.Hey, it's me from the future. There'sactually one more thing that we need todo. We need to prevent OTA updatesbecause if an update initiates, it'sgoing to unjailbreak your Kindle, and ifthat update patches the jailbreak, thatmeans that there's no way to goback. So, it's very important that wedisable these updates.

So what we're going to do is plug theKindle back in, and we’re going toinstall an extension just like we didbefore. Okay. So once we are plugged in,our Kindle's plugged in, um there areThere are two different ways we can proceed. Formost of you, you’re probably onfirmware version 5.11 or greater. Forme, I’m on 5.17. It is the mostup-to-date version as of April10th, 2025. So, we need to download thisfile. If you click this link, it’sgoing to send you over to the MobileReads forums. All we have to do isclick it. I’ve already done that.

So, let me open my downloads. We’ve gotthis zipped folder here. All we haveto do is right click,extract all, and extract. And there yougo. Now, what we need to do is plug inthe Kindle and open itup. Then, we will go over to theextensions folder, or you can just dragthis folder to the extensions folder.You don’t even need to open it. Now,if you are on version 5.1 or less,it’s actually even easier thanthis. For you guys, you willneed to plug in your Kindle just likeI’ve done. You’ll need to create afolder called this. You’ll have toright click the folder and clickproperties, and then check theread-only check box. That will makethe file read-only, and the Kindle willYou will no longer be able to change anything or update anything. Now, if you're onversion 5.11 or greater like me, allwe have to do is unplug the Kindle, andI will show you what to do after that. So, we've got the Kindle here.

What we're going to do is open Koalagain. This time you're going to seesomething new pop up. It's called renameOTAA binaries. So you're going to clickthat and then click rename. Your Kindlewill restart automatically in just asecond, and that'sokay. Okay. So to download KoReader,we're actually going to head over tothis link here. We're going to haveto use the nightly builds. If you have aKindle version after 2012, headover to the latest release. So for me,it's April 10th today. There was onereleased today a few hours ago. So we'regoing to click the most up-to-date oneand then we're going to download theKindle HF version. Again, this is superimportant if you have a newer Kindleafter 2012. So we're goingto click this. We'll save thefile. And then once it's completed,we're going to click it. We're going totake these both and drag them back out.

To yourdownloads. This will take a second, sojust be patient. So, while thisdownloads, we're actually going to beinstalling a plugin. Now, this part istotally optional, but it should makeyour life easier to adjust toKoreader. The plugin is called All MyEbooks, and what it'll do is add everysingle book that you have into acollection automatically, and it justmakes navigating Koreader way easieressentially. Okay, so to download thisplugin, we're going to head over to thisGitHub link. Again, the link will be inthe description. We're going to head to

the latest release. This one wasreleased on February 28th, and we'regoing to download the source code. So,to get the plugin ready, it shouldalready be done because it's small. So,what we're going to do is we're going toclick it. We're going todrag this to yourdownloads. What you need to do now isright-click,extract. And now it'll be in its ownfolder called all my ebooks.co plugin,the one without the zip. So this oneright here.

It has finished installing on our Kindle.Uh, or sorry, it's finished extracting all the way. So, we're goingto take the Koreader and the extensionsfolder. We're going to drag them over toyourKindle. Okay. It's asking me if Iwant to replace any files in my Kindledirectory. We are going to sayyes. And then, now technically,Koreader is installed. If you do notwant this plugin that I've discussed,which I said was optional, youcan unplug your Kindle now andyou will have Koreader. But to installthis plugin, which I promise is justgoing to make your life so much easier,we're going to take the folder thatwe've already extracted here. We'regoing to go over to Koreader on ourKindle and then we're going to go toplugins, and we're going to take it anddrag ithere. Okay, so we're back on our Kindle.

We're going to launch Koreader just like wedid before. When you first launch Koreader,there's going to be a quick start guide.You guys are welcome to take your timereading this. Using Koreader did takeme a little while to get used to.

I think I’m going to end up liking itmore, but for now, I’m not a huge fan.I actually kind of hate it.What we’re going to do is click thatfile manager button to exit out of that.So, at this point, we do technicallyhave KoReader installed.

So now we need to add books to it.I’m going to create abooks folder on KoReader.You guys can actually do that manually if youclick this button and then new folder,which we’re just going to title "Books."Create.Now, if we go to ourcomputer, any books we add here willactually appear on here.

We are going to set thisas our new home folder.To set this as our home folder, so it opens bydefault when we start KoReader,we’re going to click this button here andclick "Set as home folder"and then "Set as home."So now, when we restart KoReader,it’s just going to open right to where all of our booksare.

Now that we’ve got this folder created,what we need to do is add books to it.I’m going to plug back in myKindle and then I’ll see you guys on the computerto show you how to do it.

That thing worth mentioning is if youplug in your Kindle in Koreader, it'snot actually going to appear on yourcomputer. Um, so what you need to do isactually exit out of Koreader. So,we're going to click up here, and thenwe're going to clickthis button here, and then we'regoing to click exit and then exit again.So once it does that, it's going to exitback to your normal Kindle experience.

And there you go. Okay. So we are backon the computer. And if weopen our Kindle directory, you can seethat we now have this books folder. Nowthis is only for your Koreader books.It is important to note that theKoreader can only read EPUB books. Souh we’re going to be using Calibre toactually put the books onto the device.But, uh, if you have any EPUBs fromanywhere else, you can just drop them inhere. I'm going to use Calibre. II'm not going to get into how to useCalibre because that's not the point ofthis guide, but I can make a tutorial ifthat's something you guys would beinterested in. If you don't have an EPUBbook, but you have like a KFX file or anAW, you can convert it to EPUB.

Calibre and then basically just drag iton. So, what I'm going to do is I wantmy whole library on my Kindle. So, I’mgoing to select everything. I’m going toright-click and choose, um, I’ve alreadyconverted them, but if you don’t havethem converted, you can convert, um, inbulk, and then what I’m going to do isI’m going to click save to disk. I’mgoing to click save single format todisk and I’m going to click EPUB. Thatway I just want to make sure only theEPUBs are going over. I don’t, becauseco-reader can’t read anythingelse. So, we’re going to click okay. And

then we’re going to go over to yourKindle and then books. And we’re goingto select that folder there. And as youguys can see, it’s starting to createfolders with authors. Okay, so the booktransfer is done. We’re going to openKoala again. We’re going to clickco-reader andstart. And this time, it’s going to openour books folder that we have full ofbooks. Now, as you can see, these areall the books. It is kind of annoying tobrowse like this. So, what we’re goingto do is use that plugin I mentioned.

Going to click the screwdriver andwrench icon. Go to pagetwo. Click moretools. And then we’re going to click allebooks collection. This will run prettymuch immediately. Um, and it’s going totake effect on the next restart. So, wedo have to restart Koreader, but wedon’t have to restart the whole Kindle.So, we’re just going to click up here,click thisbutton, click exit, and restartKoreader. Again, this shouldn’t taketoo long. So, I’ll see you guys in justa second. Okay, it was actually prettymuch immediate. I didn’t even need to

cut. So, before we actually get to thecollection view, what I want to do is Iwant to, so I want to click up hereagain. I want to go to start with andwe’re going to change it to ourfavorites folder. This, uh, is technicallyempty, but uh, it will immediately putyou into the collections view, uh, andit’ll just make getting to all yourebooks faster. It’ll save you a coupleof clicks. So, if we press exit andrestart Koreader again, it’s going toput you in this collection view, whichis empty.

Downhere, we now have an all ebookscollection, and it is full of books. Um,now the first time you set this up,you're not going to have any covers, butthey'll download automatically if you'reconnected to Wi-Fi or if they'reembedded in the EPUB folder or file likemost are. So, um, what I do when I firstset it up is I just go through andlet them all update. And, basically,after every page is updated, I go on tothe next one. There's unfortunately nofaster way to do this. You kind of haveto do this the first time you set it upif you care about your book folders. It

doesn't take too long. I have quite afew books. It will probably be faster for youguys. So, I'm going to go through andget this all set up, and then I'll seeyou guys in just a second. Okay, so I'vegone through every single page. All mybooks have covers now. So, I'm going toopen what I'm currently reading, whichis the Game of Thrones series. Um, thisis like a 5,000-page book, so it'll takea little while to open. There is alittle progress bar up here as it getsready. Okay, so our book is open. I amcurrently pretty far into this series.

So I'm going to go down here. I thinkI'm somewhere around like chapter 17.Um, it's worth noting that you caneither navigate with these buttons hereor, like a standard book, you can swipe.This has taken me some getting used to.I'm not used to doing this. You canchange it, but I do think this isbetter. So I've just got to spendtime getting used to it. One thing forme that I noticed is I just wasn't ahuge fan of the way things were beinglaid out. So, to actually change stuff,um, if you click up here and downhere, you are now able to change yourfont, uh font size, your word spacing,word expansion. I do want to bring your

attention to, um, the publisher fontstyling or just styling in general. Um,it really kind of ruins some books. So,I want to show you guys how to actuallydisable it. Okay. So, what you're goingto want to do to disable this, uh, settingI'm talking about is you're going towant to open the menu, click the secondtab, click style tweaks, and then textfont size and families. And then you'regoing to ignore the publisher font sizesand font families. Um, so for me thatreally see now, now the contrast is tooHigh, but before on my other Kindle,it was way too low and there was just noway to change it.

So, I'm going to leave it like thatprobably. And for me, this is kind ofhow I like it. It's pretty close to thisone. I'll probably tweak it a little bitmore, but it's close enough. So,guys, at this point, you are fullyjailbroken. You have both KoReaderand the standard Kindle experience. Youare fully set up to use Koal to installother items or plugins. You cando things like Game Boy emulators or whateveryou’re into; you canprobably do it. Hope you guys enjoyed.Thank you guys for watching. If you haveany questions or run into anyissues, let me know. Let me know ifyou see anything that I did that waswrong.

Search in Google "Coreader."Nightly likeso, uh, and click onthat. Here we have all the nightliesthat are available. Uh, today isJanuary the 4th, so we have a new C-reader for January 4th. We'll try that.Uh, click on that. I heard that some haveproblems installing the C- reader. Icould do that on my basic Kindle, but some hadproblems with this file, so please hopethat this works. Now, uh, like the file youshould install is this KindleHF, because that means that it's um, newerKindles. The other Kindle is for all theKindles, so download this from the fourth.It says the third here, but okay, it's thethird. We takethat, likeso. Now itdownloads. Uh, like, so now we havedownloaded C reader, and now we have, wecan double tap on that to extract it. Wehave all the files you need here now, andnow we plug in the Kindle for the lasttime, hopefully.

Uh, in thisvideo, like so, uh, hope you see this.We have two folders here; we have theIn the extensions folder in the package wedownloaded and the KOReader folder wedownloaded. So if we open the Kindle inanother tab and go into the extensionsfolder there,what's inside this folder should becopied to the extensions folder. So drag thisfolder over to the[Music]extension. Now we have that in the extensionsfolder, and we go back to the root of theKindle. Now we go back to the otherfolder, the KOReader folder; that's theapplication. We drag that to the rootof the KOReader.

It's about a 100 megabytes, so it willtake a few seconds or a minute. Maybe you see itcopy the files here. I don't think Ican. As you see,here, it takes a while. So nowwhen I disconnect the Kindle, we shouldfind KOReader in the menu.Hopefully in the KOReader menu thatis.So now we open KOReaderagain and please find KOReader there sowe go into KOReaderand here we have some options tostart KOReader.

No framework means that you, uh, say someRAM memory, but that is a kind of buggystart Cod ASAP. It is a faster way ofstarting Cod. I don't know, actually,what's the difference there, uh, but startC reader is the one I usually use. Youalso have tools here. You can update yourC reader from here and clean install Creader if you want. Uh,but I should start Creader. No, it didn't work.Yes, maybe. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.Yes, it took a while. Only so that is howyou install everything. I'm so happynow. So we go back to my face cam instead.

So this isawesome, gentlemen and ladies. Thisis amazing. This is amazing! I'm so happynow. So, uh, I don't know what todo, really. This is awesome! I succeededwith my Paperwhite. It runs Cod readernow, and I'm so happy. Uh, so now I canstart setting up Cod reader as I wantit and so on. On my Paperwhite, it worksawesomely. Uh, it's hard to see here, butyou have, um, some simple settings already:the progress bar and so on. So this isawesome, actually. So now we have Codreader on it, as you see here.

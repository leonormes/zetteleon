## Full Document
This is my Kindle e-reader. Um, and Iabsolutely love it. I am a big fan ofreading in this format, particularlywhen I travel. But you know what thischannel's about. So, today, let's dosome stuff with this that it reallyshouldn't be capable of.[Music]So, I've had this for years. Itis looking a bit worn, a bit tired. Um,and yeah, I really have no faults forit. I'm not particularly happy about thewhole walled garden thing that Amazonhas and the controversies thatthey've had over the years around theirebooks and all that sort of stuff. Not afan of that. Uh, so today we're going tobreak free. We are going to jailbreak

this Kindle and then we're going to seewhat we can do with this becausefundamentally under the interface it's aLinux computer and you know I do love agood Linux computer, particularly ininteresting form factors. So, let's seeif we can get a full Linux distributionrunning on this. Uh, and let's see whatother jailbroken apps are availablehere. Let's get into it. So, here it isin all its glory. I do believe this isthe 10th gen Kindle. It's definitelyLooking a bit worse for wear, it’s quiteworn around the edges, especially on theback as well. I do just literally throwthis into my bag whenever I’m traveling.

And it’s great for reading,particularly, but there are lots oflimitations with the Kindle system.Namely, of course, the fact that youcan’t use all different types ofe-reading formats, and you have to useAmazon services to actually get anythingon here or do anything with it. So, let’schange that and see what we cando. Now, there is a website calledKindle Modding which has everything youneed to jailbreak your Kindle. Dependingon which Kindle you have and which OSversion you have is going to depend onwhat jailbreaking you can actually use.I know that the very latest version ofthe Kindle operating system isn’tjailbroken yet. This is actually byhabit; I am actually still running an olderversion just because I don’t reallyconnect to Wi-Fi unless I have to, tosave battery. So, this is running anolder version, which means we can stilljailbreak it. But if you had one thathas recently been updated, you may haveto wait.

This wiki and the Discord that thereis as well. I know that they're workingon a new jailbreak, so I can't imagineit'll be long. It might already be out.Make sure you go check that out. So,we're going to follow the steps on thewebsite and then, yeah, let's see howthis goes and go from there. Really,nothing much more to say. Let's get itdone. Okay, so following the guide onthe website, we're just rebooting ourKindle. Like I said, it was already inairplane mode anyway. Uh, and then we'vegot these files here that we need tocopy across to the Kindle. All right, sowe are all booted up. Let's plug it in

andallow it to connect. It's in USB drivemode and it comes up here. So, here wego. We can thenjust extract that and we're going tojust copy all of thesefiles onto the machine, replacing anythat it tells us to. So, we're now goingto inject the Kindle. And there we go.And then here it says, "Open the Kindlestore on your Kindle by clicking the caricon on thescreen. When prompted, click yes to turnoff airplane.

Mode. And you can see that it's loadingin thehack. And then it says, "Click on thewinter brick icon when itloads." That just says jailbreaking.Please wait. Oh, and it's doing hackerythings.There we go. It says finishedinstalling jailbreak. Please installhotfix now. So now we have to go throughand set up the hot fix. Now we need toplug our Kindle backinto thecomputer and copy over the file.We have this and we have this bin filethat we're going to copy over to there.Once again, eject it. And then we aregoing to turn on Wi-Fi, um, airplane modeagain. And then we're going to go intosettings and we're going to click on thethree dots and we're going to say updateyour Kindle.It's doing more Linuxy[Music]things. And we're back to the homescreen. And we have this run hot fixwhich we can then run. And it does somemore funthings. Okay, that's now done. So now we

can install the application loader andThe package installer allows us toinstall Homebrew stuff on here. So let'sdo that next. Plug back in and we'regoing to copy over the extensions and MLpackage folders from the nextdownload. Like so. Yeah, we've got thebin file. So, we're going to put that inthe MRpackage. Mr. Packages, don'tknow, but there we go. We're going to dothat. And then we're going toinject Kendall. Then we need to typeinsemicolonlog spacemrpi. Hitenter. And it's doing things.

On with the video.

[Music][Music]And it's again done restarting theUI. And there we go. That is now loadedon here as well. So finally, we justneed to disable the over-the-air updates.

Otherwise, every time we get an update,we may break the jailbreak, or at thevery least we have to run the hot fixagain. It's just easier to disable ituntil we hit a point where we need toupgrade the operating system. So, let'sdo that next. All right, so next up,disabling the over-the-air updates doesdepend on the current firmware version.So, gone in and checked what that is.Uh, but let's go through. So, we can sayif it's above 5.11, we need to do somestuff. Uh, which unfortunately ours is.It's 5.17. So, we're going to downloadthis extension. Plug the Kindle into yourPC. Wait for your computer to recognizethedevice. Unzip and copy the renamed OTAAbin folder to the extensions folder inyour Kindle.So, we'vegotthat. Come over here. We've gotextensions. So, we're going to copy thatinto there likeso.And safely check the computer Kindle.

From the computer,open the applicationloader and then we can select renameOTAA binaries. Selectrename. It's doing stuff. It will rebootall back on. So we should actually nowbe able to safely turn offairplane mode and reenableWi-Fi. So we can do that. Job done.And we can now also then reenable accessto the Kindle store. Personally, I don'treally need that. There'snothing that I need to get from theKindle store now. So, we're going toskip that step and go straight into

installing the KO reader, which is anadditional ebook reader that supportsall sorts of formats, which basicallymeans you can read what you want on yourKindle instead of having to rely on theUI and library system that the Kindlecurrently uses. So, let's dothat. We can take a look here, andit kind of tells you to check whatfirmware version you're using. Wealready know that. So we can go to thenext step and we can choose to downloadour version from here. So we can usethis bottom one here: Kindle HF.

The Kindle device is running firmware that isgreater than5.16. So we can come here to the releasepage and find the version that wewant. Next, we can copy the pluginagain. We just need to extractthat, and then we've got KO reader andextensions. We need to copy those twofoldersover, and we do that.We’ll merge the extensionsfolder because I'm guessing the extensionadds in another extension. Look at that.Who would have thunk it?

And then we have, if we go into our applicationloader, we now have KO reader here.We can kind of, basically, there are acouple of different ways thatwe can run this. We can either justuse the stark KO reader, which is thedesigned way to run it, just how you’resupposed to run it. We can use noframework, which kills the Kindle UI toallocate more resources to it. Um, orASAP, which skips a couple of checks andstarts KO reader as soon as possible.

So we'll go with the normal one and load thatup.And here we go. It's loaded up and we'vegot this kind of quick start guide thatThis gives usinformation on the user interface. It showsyou all the different things that youcan do. It's very similar to the UIcontrols that you get on the normalKindle interface by the looks of things.

You've got a status bar, and you've got allsorts going on here. Uh, so yeah, this isreally cool. Now you canadd in your own documentsand files and just transfer them overhere. As you can see, it's just reallyeasy. Now you have full control. Anydocument you want to read, youcan do it with this. That's perfect.Actually, for a lot of people, that'sprobably as far as they want to take it.Having said that, that's not what thischannel's about. We are not most people.So, let's get some other apps installedand let’s see what they’re like, and uhI’ll get back to you. It’s a fewdays later, uh, because such is time. Uh,but we do now have everythingthat I could get set up. I willsay there was a bit of an issue in thatin very recent versions of the Kindlefirmware, Kindle OS, uh, they've made aswitch from using software floatingpoint to hardware floating point.

Essentially, what that means is anysoftware that was compiled for the olderfirmwares won't work on the newfirmwares. So what that does mean isthat a lot of the stuff that's floatingout there for apps and stuff to runon hacked Kindles, unfortunately, theydon't work because they haven't beenupdated to use the latestfirmware. So we're kind of limited inwhat I was able to get set up. Butimportantly, I was able to set up theone thing I actually wanted to be ableto do. So, you know, that's good.

As we already saw, we got thealternative e-reader softwareinstalled and running. That was fine.But let's have a look at the other bitsthat I have managed to get installed.So, there's essentially two things thatI managed to get installed on here.

If we go into our application loader,the main one being this program herecalled Kerm, which gives you aninteractive terminal. So this isjust booting into kind of the underlyingLinux operating system that is run onthese Kindles. It's very stripped down.There isn't a huge amount you can do,but this application acts as a niceThe interface allows you to interface with a commandline. Um, the keyboard works reallywell. Uh, yeah, I'm a big fan ofthis and, uh, yeah, it works.

I'm happy with that. Now, the reasonwhy I wanted this is to bundle it withthe other thing that I've been able todo, which is basically getting a fullLinux distribution running on here.

The other thing that I wanted to do withthis was a little project that I foundcalled Alpine Kindle. This isbasically a collection of scripts tohelp you get Alpine Linux running onyour Kindle. So, because this is using aLinux kernel, you can use a littleprogram called chirut to change the rootdirectory that the kernel is looking at.

Therefore, you can basically runany Linux distribution you want as longas it's compiled for the rightprocessor. I used to do this all the timewith my Android devices since they use aLinux kernel. You could do that andthen get access to Linuxutilities. That's the next thing thatwe did with this. This project makes it super easy to do.You can download one of the preconfiguredLinux images if you want.

They are 6 years old now, so I would probablyadvise you to build your own, but you can dothat as well. They provide a script todo that. The provided image does includea GUI, and you can actuallyaccess the web, file manager, andnormal stuff like that. Honestly, it'snot the best experience. Um, it kind ofdoesn't work very well with the e-screen because the display managerdoesn't know it needs to refresh thescreen more often, and different thingsfor the e-ink. So, you get a lot ofghosting, a lot of floating stuff about,Um, I would actually advise againstusing this and instead focus on theterminal version. So, I built an image.

It doesn't have a GUI. Um, but they doprovide a nice little launcherapplication. So you can pop in and justdrop straight down into a Linuxshell. And here we are. We have a fullLinux shell. We can kind of see that weare in this root file system which looksa lot more like a normal Linux root filesystem. We can do Linuxy things. Uh, Idon't know what else is actually installed here,but there you go.There's top. So we can see the processesrunning on our Kindle.

You can do different bits and pieces.However, the one thing I really wantedto be able to do with this is thenactually use SSH to connect to my ownserver. And just like that, we areconnected to my Linux home server,which is sitting over there somewhere.And, yeah, you can then obviouslymanage your home server. We could alsodrop in and check on the systemprocesses that are running on there,make sure what's going on and all thatsort of fun stuff. We can obviously doany management tasks that we need. Thisis a full, lightweight, portableLinux terminal, and that is very cool. I

the nerd in me is justloving this. I think it's a great formfactor for it. The keyboard is prettyeasy to use. Obviously, it's not thebest in the world, but you know, as aon-screen keyboard, I think it worksquite well. Overall, yeah, it's justa great little package if you wanted tobe able to monitor things on a lowpower machine. It's great. Ilove it. This is such a cool idea, andI've had a lot of fun doing this. Um, soI hope you've had a lot of fun watchingit as well.

I recommend this as a little project. Ithink it's very easy now to jailbreakthe Kindle and to be able to get accessto these sorts of things. I hope thatwe'll see more applications getrecompiled for the hard floatingpoint, but for now, this is what we'vegot and I think it's very, very cool.All right, then. So, there we have it.I'm going to wrap it up there for today.I think it's really cool that we cankind of repurpose things like Kindle andstuff and make a really cool e- inkind of Linux shell basically. I thinkthat's really cool. Uh, yeah.Okay. And you know, you can still doe-reading as well. So, that's good.It means I don't lose my books, but alsoit means I have a Linux terminal in mypocket. Very cool. All right. We'regoing to wrap it up there. Thank youvery much for watching. I hope you haveenjoyed this video. As always, I'veenjoyed putting it together, and I'll seeyou again for another one very, verysoon. Bye for now.[Music]

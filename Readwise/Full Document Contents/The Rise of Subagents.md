- Summary: Subagents are specialized AI helpers designed to handle specific tasks with their own tools and context. They can be fixed and user-defined or created on-the-fly by an orchestrator to fit unique needs. Using subagents improves focus and reliability but balancing control and flexibility remains a challenge.

## Full Document
There is an increasing use of Subagents to reliably handle specific user goals. We can see this in tools like Claude Code and [Poke.com](http://poke.com/). A subagent is a specialized Agent that is purpose-built for a single, well-defined task. Subagents can be explicit, where a user or model defines them for reuse or implicit and dynamically defined. This addresses a key limitation of monolithic AI agents context pollution. When a single, big and complex agent handles many tasks, its context window, number of tools, can become cluttered and less reliable.

#### What are Subagents?

Subagents are specialized AI agents. They are most of the time used in combination with an orchestrator, which delegates tasks to them. A subagent is just like a normal agent and has the same components. This includes a name for identification, a description of its capabilities, system instructions and a set of tools to interact with environments. It also has its own isolated context window.

```

        │- Analyzes Request         │
        │- Decomposes Task          │
        │- Delegates to Subagents   │

```

Explicit, User-defined Subagents are a permanent team of reusable specialists. Subagent can be defined in a static file or directly in code and the orchestrator uses them trough their name or when a prompt matches its `description`. Claude Code uses this method. The tools are manually listed in the definition, and the agent is stateless, meaning it starts fresh on every run.

**Pros:**

* You have full control over the agent's tools and behavior.
* The agent's actions are very predictable and secure.
* Reusable and easy to test in isolation

**Cons:**

* The system is rigid. You must update the definition file to add new tools.
* The orchestrator must manage all the state between steps.
* Hard to scale to hunderds of specialized task.

Here is a pseudo-code snippet of a definition file, inspired from Claude Code:

```

description: "MUST BE USED for reviewing code against style guides and security practices."
tools: ['file_read', 'search_code']

You are an expert security code reviewer. Your purpose is to analyze code and identify vulnerabilities. Provide feedback in a numbered list.

```

Implicit, On-the-Fly Subagents can be created temporary by an orchestrator to handle tasks as they come up. The orchestrator uses a tool (`send_message_to_agent`) to create and interact with the agent. The system dynamically assigns tools based on the user's natural language request from pre-defined pool which are needed to solve the task. Poke.com uses this method to created unlimited agents for specific user request. A key feature is that these agents can be stateful, e.g. keep context from previous runs when called with the same `agent_name`.

Here is a pseudo-code snippet for how the orchestrator calls the agent:

```

    agent_name="q3_report_email_draft",
    description="An agent specializing in drafting internal company communications, specifically for report summaries and team updates.",
    message=f"""Draft an email to the marketing team about the Q3 report.
 

    - Professional yet approachable and optimistic.
    - Be concise and data-driven. Avoid corporate jargon.
    - IMPORTANT: Analyze my last 5 sent emails to the 'marketing-team@' mailing list to match my typical writing style, greeting, and sign-off.

    RULES & CONSTRAINTS:

    - Use bullet points to present the key metrics for scannability.
    - Keep the total email length under 200 words.
    - End with a clear call to action: ask the team to review the full report and send their feedback for the Q4 planning session by EOD Friday.

```

* **Pros:**
	+ The system is very flexible and requires no setup.
	+ Tools are selected based on the unique user task.
	+ Multi-step tasks are straightforward because the agent remembers its context.
* **Cons:**
	+ The system is less predictable and you have less direct control.
	+ It might fail if it misunderstands the task and assigns the wrong tools.
	+ Harder to debug and reproduce failures since the agent’s configuration is generated dynamically.

Both predefined and on-the-fly subagents will see increased usage. Dynamic agents might find more adoption in general B2C applications. Predefined agents are a great fit for more structured and repeatable enterprise workflows.

[Context Engineering is everything](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering). The key to success is giving the LLM the right information and tools at the right time. Using Subagents allows us to create a focused environment for the LLM with a clear, isolated context, specific system instructions, and a limited set of tools for the task. This improves performance and can reduce the cost of reaching the goal.

But even with a subagent architecture, [reliability is still a challenge](https://www.philschmid.de/agents-pass-at-k-pass-power-k) for agentic systems, breaking down a complex task into smaller subagent functions can make them easier to test and evaluate in isolation.

Models are improving very fast. Don’t over-engineer a solution today that a simpler or better model can solve tomorrow.

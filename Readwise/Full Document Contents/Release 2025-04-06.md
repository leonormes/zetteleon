Announcements

Starting in May 2025, Azure Kubernetes Service will begin rolling out a change to enable quota for all current and new AKS customers. AKS quota will represent a limit of the maximum number of managed clusters that an Azure subscription can consume per region. Existing AKS customer subscriptions will be given a quota limit at or above their current usage, depending on region availability. Once quota is enabled, customers can view their available quota and request quota increases in the Quotas page in the Azure Portal or by using the Quotas REST API. For details on how to view and request quota increases via the Portal Quotas page, visit Azure Quotas. For details on how to view and request quota increases via the Quotas REST API, visit: Azure Quota REST API Reference. New AKS customer subscriptions will be given a default limit upon new subscription creation. More information on the default limits for new subscriptions is available in documentation here.
AKS Kubernetes version 1.32 roll out has been delayed and is now expected to reach all regions on or before the end of April. Please use the az-aks-get-versions command to accurately capture if Kubernetes version 1.32 is available in your region.
Kubernetes version 1.28 will become an additional Long Term Support (LTS) version in AKS, alongside existing LTS versions 1.27 and 1.30.
You can now switch non-LTS clusters on Kubernetes versions 1.25 onwards and within 3 versions of the current LTS versions to LTS by switching their tier to Premium.
As of 31 March 2025, AKS no longer allows new cluster creation with the Basic Load Balancer. On 30 September 2025, the Basic Load Balancer will be retired. We will be posting updates on migration paths to the Standard Load Balancer. See AKS Basic LB Migration Issue for updates on when a simplified upgrade path is available. Refer to Basic Load Balancer Deprecation Upda...

##### Announcements

* Starting in May 2025, Azure Kubernetes Service will begin rolling out a change to enable quota for all current and new AKS customers. AKS quota will represent a limit of the maximum number of managed clusters that an Azure subscription can consume per region. Existing AKS customer subscriptions will be given a quota limit at or above their current usage, depending on region availability. Once quota is enabled, customers can view their available quota and request quota increases in the Quotas page in the Azure Portal or by using the Quotas REST API. For details on how to view and request quota increases via the Portal Quotas page, visit [Azure Quotas](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quotas/view-quotas). For details on how to view and request quota increases via the Quotas REST API, visit: [Azure Quota REST API Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/reserved-vm-instances/quotaapi). New AKS customer subscriptions will be given a default limit upon new subscription creation. More information on the default limits for new subscriptions is available in documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits).
* AKS Kubernetes version 1.32 roll out has been delayed and is now expected to reach all regions on or before the end of April. Please use the [az-aks-get-versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-get-versions) command to accurately capture if Kubernetes version 1.32 is available in your region.
* Kubernetes version 1.28 will become an **additional** [Long Term Support (LTS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/long-term-support) version in AKS, alongside existing LTS versions 1.27 and 1.30.
* You can now [switch non-LTS clusters](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-cli#faq) on Kubernetes versions 1.25 onwards and within 3 versions of the current LTS versions to LTS by switching their tier to Premium.
* As of 31 March 2025, AKS no longer allows new cluster creation with the Basic Load Balancer. On 30 September 2025, the Basic Load Balancer will be retired. We will be posting updates on migration paths to the Standard Load Balancer. See [AKS Basic LB Migration Issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/1687) for updates on when a simplified upgrade path is available. Refer to [Basic Load Balancer Deprecation Update](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=azure-basic-load-balancer-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2025-upgrade-to-standard-load-balancer) for more information.
* The asm-1-22 revision for the Istio-based service mesh add-on has been deprecated. Migrate to a supported revision following the [AKS Istio upgrade guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/istio-upgrade).

* Starting on 17 June 2025, AKS will no longer create new node images for [Ubuntu 18.04](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4873) or provide security updates. Existing node images will be deleted. Your node pools will be unsupported and you will no longer be able to scale. To avoid service disruptions, scaling restrictions, and remain supported, please follow our instructions to [upgrade](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster?tabs=azure-cli) to a [supported Kubernetes version](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions).
* Starting on 17 March 2027, AKS will no longer create new node images for [Ubuntu 20.04](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4874) or provide security updates. Existing node images will be deleted. Your node pools will be unsupported and you will no longer be able to scale. To avoid service disruptions, scaling restrictions, and remain supported, please follow our instructions to [upgrade](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster?tabs=azure-cli) to Kubernetes version 1.34+ by the retirement date.
* HTTP Application Routing (preview) has been retired as of March 3, 2025 and AKS will start to block new cluster creation with HTTP App routing enabled. Affected clusters must [migrate](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/app-routing-migration) to the generally available Application Routing add-on prior to that date.
* Customers with nodepools using [Standard\_NC24rsv3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-nc24rs-retirement) VM sizes should resize or deallocate those VMs. Microsoft will deallocate remaining Standard\_NC24rsv3 VMs in the coming weeks.

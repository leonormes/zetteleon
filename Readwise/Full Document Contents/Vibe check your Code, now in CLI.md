#### Fix with AI.

CodeRabbit CLI hands off both the recommended code changes and deep context it generates to your AI agent via a prompt. Maintain your flow state with reviews that seamlessly integrate with your CLI coding agent letting it know what code change to make, with context, all in natural language.

##### Seamless integration with AI coding assistants

CodeRabbit CLI bridges AI code generation and production readiness. Works with Claude Code, Cursor CLI, Gemini CLI, and others to enable autonomous generate-review-iterate cycles. One command coderabbit review --plain transforms any CLI Coding agent into a complete development system. The missing piece for production-ready AI code.

See [AGC networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/container-networking) for details on Overlay compatibility.
* [Advanced Container Networking Services: Layer 7 Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/azure-cni-network-security) reached General Availability.
* [Disabling SSH](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/manage-ssh-node-access?tabs=node-shell#disable-ssh-overview) on Windows node pools is now available.
* [Ubuntu 24.04 CVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-cvm) is now enabled by default for K8s version 1.34-1.38.
* [OpenID Connect (OIDC) issuer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-oidc-issuer) is now enabled by default on new cluster creation for Kubernetes version 1.34 and above.
* [Node Auto-provisioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/node-autoprovision?tabs=azure-cli) enabled clusters can use [planned maintenance](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/planned-maintenance?tabs=azure-cli) for scheduling node image upgrades that adhere to `aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`.
* When upgrading from kubenet to Azure CNI Overlay, customers can now specify a different pod CIDR using the --pod-cidr parameter. See [Upgrade Azure CNI](https://docs.azure.cn/aks/upgrade-azure-cni#upgrade-to-azure-cni-overlay) for more information.
* The migration CLI command to migrate from Availability Sets on AKS is now Generally Available. The feature is accessible in the [Azure CLI v2.76.0 (August 2025)](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/release-notes-azure-cli#august-05-2025). For more information on the migration tool, visit our [Availability Sets migration documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/availability-sets-on-aks).
* The migration CLI command to migrate from the Basic Load Balancer on AKS is now Generally Available. The feature is accessible in the [Azure CLI v2.76.0 (August 2025)](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/release-notes-azure-cli#august-05-2025). For more information on the migration tool, visit our [Basic Load Balancer migration documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/%5Bupgrade-basic-load-balancer-on-aks).
* Azure Linux 3.0 now supports the [NVIDIA NC A100](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-linux/intro-azure-linux#azure-linux-container-host-supported-gpu-virtual-machine-sizes) GPU on AKS.
* AKS now supports a new OS Sku enum, [`AzureLinux3`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version#migrate-to-azure-linux-30). This enum is now GA and supported in Kubernetes versions 1.28 to 1.36 using Azure CLI version 18.0.0b36 or later for preview and version 2.78.0 or later for GA. OS Sku `AzureLinux3` is recommended if you need to migrate to Azure Linux 3.0 without upgrading your Kubernetes version.

###### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where [ETag](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_design.html#conditional-requests) was not returned in [ManagedClusters](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/aks/managed-clusters?view=rest-aks-2025-05-01) or [AgentPools](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/aks/agent-pools?view=rest-aks-2025-05-01) responses in API versions 2024-09-01 or newer, even though the API specification said it would be.
* Fixed [cluster autoscaler bug 7694](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues/7964) in kubernetes version 1.31+, where the "DeletionCandidateOfClusterAutoscaler" taint would persist on some of the remaining nodes after scale-down. This incorrect tainting prevented new pods from being scheduled on those nodes.

###### Behavioral Changes

* All AKS Automatic clusters, and AKS Standard clusters that enabled [Deployment Safeguards](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/deployment-safeguards) via the safeguardsProfile, will now have a new `Microsoft.ContainerService/deploymentSafeguards` sub-resource created under `managedClusters`. See [Use Deployment Safeguards](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/deployment-safeguards) for more information.
* Disallow adding non-Node auto provisioning pools to [AKS Automatic](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-aks-automatic) clusters. There is no effect on existing Automatic Clusters that have non-Node auto provisioning pools.
* A new runTimeClassName, `kata-vm-isolation`, has been added for [Pod Sandboxing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-pod-sandboxing) in preparation for deprecating the old `kata-mshv-vm-isolation` name. Users can continue using the original name for the time being.
* Starting with Kubernetes version 1.34, all AKS Automatic clusters will include a new AKS-managed component named `Cluster Health Monitor` within the kube-system namespace. This component is designed to collect metrics related to the cluster’s control plane and AKS-managed components, helping ensure these services are operating as expected and improving overall observability.

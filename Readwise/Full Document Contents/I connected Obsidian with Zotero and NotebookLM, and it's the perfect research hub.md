Research can feel like juggling. I need a note-taking app to jot down my ideas. I also need an app to help me gather the information I need, and another to help me analyze what I collect. So I connected Obsidian, Zotero, and NotebookLM, and chaos finally had lanes.

Now, researching is so much easier. I add the sources I need to Zotero with clean metadata, Obsidian keeps my outlines in one place, and NotebookLM works as my assistant, summarizing what I save and highlighting recurring topics. With this triple threat, there’s no topic too difficult to understand.

####  How Obsidian streamlines your research workflow

#####  Tools that turn notes into a network

Obsidian is my note-taking app where I keep all my thoughts and research notes. I like that it stores everything locally, which lowers the risk of hacking. [Graph View](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-visualize-your-notes-in-obsidian-with-graph-view/) helped me realize I hadn’t linked a VPN note. It was sitting alone, even though it should have been connected to my other notes on Android Security.

Thanks to the wide variety of [Community Plugins in Obsidian](https://www.xda-developers.com/obsidian-plugin-makes-graph-feature-less-overwhelming-useful/), I can customize the note-taking app so that everything is in place to help me work more efficiently. For example, after installing the Calendar plugin, I clicked on a meeting day and added notes for reference. I can also save time by using internal links between notes, like when I had to connect a Gmail note with the importance of having a strong password.

Obsidian is a feature-rich note-taking app that's available on different platforms and offers a neat and clean interface. It's also free to use for individuals.

####  How I use Zotero to organize my research

#####  Saving articles quickly and tracking ideas over time

   ![Zotero showing collection created for Obsidian, Proxy, and Android](https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/zotero-research-tool.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2) 
Before, when I needed to save a site for future reference, I would create a folder in my browser and file it there. Not too long ago, I needed to save a site that shared useful Obsidian tips. I clicked the Comet Zotero connector, selected the collector where I wanted to file it, and clicked Save. One thing I love is how Zotero automatically grabs key citation details, so I never have to copy titles or authors by hand.

Besides adding references via the connector, Zotero also lets you add them by DOI, ISBN, or URL. I created various collections of the topics I research most, for fun or for work, so when I come across something I want to keep, I can easily find it later. To do this, I had to install Zotero for Windows and the Zotero Connector. The setup took a few minutes, but it saves time later when gathering sources.

Zotero collects sources and other metadata from research papers, webpages, etc., that can be inserted into documents in the form of citations.

   ![NotebookLM showing research text on internet quiet hours](https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/notebook-lm-research-tool.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2) 
I set up a notebook called Quiet Internet. I added the sources I could find and pasted them into [NotebookLM](https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm/). The audio and video overviews helped me understand the parts I struggled with; I learn better visually. The podcast-style audio overview made specific terminology clearer in a conversational way, and the option to ask follow-up questions when I needed them helped deepen my understanding of internet quiet hours.

I also downloaded the notebook in case I needed to review it without an internet connection. The source summaries helped me spot gaps in my research, such as missing context on router scheduling. I used the Notebook’s citation view to double-check the source of each claim before adding it to my notes.

   ![NotebookLM](https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/notebooklm-removebg-preview.png?q=70&fit=contain&w=420&dpr=1) 
NotebookLM is a research notebook that works only with the documents you add, building a clear brief from your sources. You can ask questions, get cited answers, and save quotes to a noteboard for quick reuse.

####  When Obsidian, Zotero, and NotebookLM slow you down

#####  Set up overhead, context switching, and duplicate files

   ![NotebookLM self hosting notebook next to tote bag](https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/notebooklm-self-hosting-notebook-next-to-tote-bag.jpeg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2) 
The three apps are a powerful combo, but there can be too many apps to handle. You can be okay with using your note-taking app, whether it's Obsidian or not, and an AI assistant like ChatGPT or Perplexity to help you understand certain parts.

As long as you take small steps in understanding a complex topic, you’re good with two apps. Context switching hurts focus, and the fewer apps you have to switch from, the better.

####  Why three tools are worth it for new projects

#####  Zotero captures, Obsidian organizes, NotebookLM explains

   ![zotero translate annotation pane in the editor](https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/09/zotero-translate-annotation-pane.jpg?q=49&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=2) 
Yes, it’s extra overhead, but each tool earns its keep. Zotero makes it easy for me not only to grab sources, but also to organize them in a collection for easy finding later. Obsidian is one of the most popular note-taking apps, and thanks to Community Plugins, I can set it up to fit my style.

I already have dozens of apps installed on my computer, so adding one or two more won’t make much of a difference. If I ever feel that one of them isn’t giving me the results I need, I can always install it. By using all three apps, you get better note connections and smarter Q&As.

#####  Building a research workflow that actually fits

For different reasons, you’re already juggling various apps. Whether it's for work or personal projects, there is always going to be something a great app lacks. That’s where you look for another app to fill that gap. So far, I haven’t found one app that has everything I need, so I have no choice but to work with a few. But, as long as I get the results I want, I don’t mind.

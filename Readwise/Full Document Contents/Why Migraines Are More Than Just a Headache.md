So today we're going to talk aboutmigraines. Migraines can affect up to15% of the population, with women beingaffected more than men. Now most peoplewill tell you that a migraine is aheadache, and that is true. It doesresult in terrible head pain. However,those who actually get migraines willprobably tell you there's a little bitmore to it than just simply a headache.So we're going to get into exactly whata migraine is: learn that it's actuallymade up of multiple phases. And thiswill help us to understand the symptomsand even potential triggers that peoplecan try to avoid in order to reducetheir risk of getting migraines. And ofcourse, we're obviously going to usesome anatomical awesomeness to help usdescribe these migraines. So, let's dothis.

So, let's start with the definition of amigraine. A migraine is a complexneurological disorder that can bedivided into four different phases. Andso we're going to discuss each one ofthese phases because it will helpexplain why people experience the manydifferent symptoms of a migraine, whichwill also show us that this is more thanJust a basic headache. The first phaseof a migraine is called thepremonitory phase. This can start upto 72 hours before the actual headacheeven starts. People can experiencesymptoms like fatigue, photophobia,which is light sensitivity,irritability, and sometimes even feeldepressed. They can also notice thatthey might yawn more and have foodcravings, and even have stiffness incertain muscles, especially the muscles

of the neck. And so the next questionmight be: What is actually initiating orcausing this premonitory phase? Well,it's believed that this is in part dueto an alteration in homeostasis. And ifyou talk about homeostasis or keepingthe body in balance and equilibrium, youhave to talk about that wonderfulstructure called the hypothalamus. Thehypothalamus is located in the centralcore of the brain, right underneath myprobe here. And here are some otherfamiliar structures like the pituitarygland here. Here's the brain stem, andeven this beautiful cerebellum overhere. But the hypothalamus is involvedwith maintaining homeostasis throughoutthe body. But how does it do this? Well,For one, the hypothalamus is theprincipal autonomic center of the brain.

And if you haven't heard of theautonomic division of the nervous system,this is the part of the nervoussystem that controls unconsciousprocesses. It controls thingsautomatically, so you don't have to thinkabout it. The hypothalamus, being theprincipal autonomic center of the brain,controls many of these processes, such asregulating certain behaviors, regulatingfood cravings, thirst, and hungermechanisms, and it even gets involved inregulating body temperature in thecircadian rhythm. The hypothalamus alsoreleases its own hormones and regulatesthe release of hormones from thepituitary gland. This is probablywhy women are a little bit more affectedby migraines than men, due to thegreater fluctuations in hormone releasewith the menstrual cycle.

So if we kind of just take a step back and comparethe functions of the hypothalamus withsome of the pre-menstrual symptoms, likefatigue, behavioral changes, foodcravings, etc., you can see how thisrelationship between alterations inhomeostatic controls could result inThese various symptoms raise the question: is thereanything that a person could do duringthis premonitory phase, or before that,that could influence their risk of getting amigraine? And the answer is yes. Thedata have shown that people withmigraines tend to have brains that are alittle bit more sensitive to certainstimuli. They have gathered a wholebunch of data on certain environmental

stimuli that could be potential migrainetriggers, and this can be quite the longlist. Some of these triggers includeemotional stress, hormones, not eating,weather, sleep disturbances, evencertain smells or odors, neck pain,alcohol, bright lights, smoke, certaintypes of food, even exercise, and evensexual activity. That last one wasadmittedly kind of a bummer, but luckily,that list is ordered from most common to leastcommon. In the study we arereferencing here, only 5% of peoplereported that sex was a possibletrigger. So you can all probably stillparticipate in safe, consensual activities.

But moving on, why do we care aboutall of this information during thepremonitory phase? Well, remember it canstart up to 72 hours prior to the actualHeadache. And if you can get out aheadand start treatment before the headacheeven starts, the outcomes are muchbetter. So when migraine patients comeinto the clinic with me, I’ll ask themif they can trace or track the previousthree days: specifically the types of foodsthey were eating, what was their moodlike, what were their sleep patternslike, and if they had any of these

symptoms. And if they can gather thisinformation, it can be quite useful forfuture migraines. Now, the problem is,who doesn’t yawn on a daily basis? Whodoesn’t have some food cravings? So,tracking some of these symptoms can bechallenging, but a lot of the timethese migraine patients can actually getenough information to find theirtriggers and what their symptoms areduring this premonitory phase. The nextphase of a migraine is the aura phase.

Only about one-third of people withmigraines experience this phase. Butwhat is an actual aura? Well, an aura isa fully reversible neurological symptomthat precedes or sometimes evenaccompanies the actual headache. Andthere are four types of auras that youcan see in a migraine.

The most common is the visual aura, which isspotted or blurred vision. Sometimespeople will have little zigzag linesthat'll come into their visual field.This is the type of aura that I've hadduring my migraines, and mine completelyprecedes the headache and goes awayprior to the headache starting. But thisis one of my biggest warning signs tohurry and go get the migrainemedications because, again, the sooner youinitiate treatment for migraines, thebetter the outcome. Some people can alsoget a sensory aura, which is tingling onone side of the body, typically in theupper limb or on a side of the face. You

can get a language aura, which isdifficulty with wording and speech, andeven a motor aura, which is weakness onone side of the body. Now, the languageand motor auras can be a bit scary forpeople, especially during the firsttime because people may think thatthese are similar to stroke symptoms.But a couple of things to keep in mindare that these are by far the leastcommon types of migraine auras. And onemain difference between these types ofauras and stroke symptoms is that strokesymptoms tend to come on suddenly.

Whereas the language and motor auras aremore of a gradual onset over 20 to 30minutes. But don't mess around if youhaven't been diagnosed with migrainesbefore. If you experience these types ofsymptoms, get checked out at theemergency department immediately. Butwhat is responsible for the aura phase?Well, the going theory or goinghypothesis is that there's this processcalled cortical spreading depression.

And so let's use this brain to help usbreak down this term and to understandwhat's happening with this corticalspreading depression. What I'm tracinghere is the largest portion of yourbrain called the cerebrum. Down here wehave the cerebellum, but right here thelargest portion is called the cerebrum. Andthe outside surface of an organ iscalled the cortex. And so the outsidesurface of the cerebrum is referred to asthe cerebral cortex. So that is what thecortical part is referring to withcortical spreading depression. But whatis meant by the spreading depressionpart? Well, it's believed that there'sthis depression of neurons that occursthroughout the cortex or this wave ofneuronal depression that's propagating.

Or spreading across the cerebral cortex.Kind of like a drop in a pond creatingthis ripple effect. Now, when a neurondepolarizes, that is essentially when itfires or sends its signal. But in thiscase, you get this wave of neuronsdepolarizing again across the cortex.And after this wave of neuronaldepolarization takes place, the neuronstend to stay depolarized longer thanthey normally would before repolarizingor recharging. So they kind of remain in thisdepressed state; hence corticalspreading depression. And it's believed

that this is responsible for the aurasymptoms that we just previouslymentioned. Now, many people that getmigraines don’t get the aura. So, isthis cortical spreading depression justnot occurring in them? Well, that's notfully understood, and it still may beoccurring, and if it is, it is eitherthought to occur in areas of the brainthat are not under conscious awareness,or it may just be mild enough to whereit doesn’t create any noticeablesymptoms in that person.

And now on to the third stage of a migraine, which isthe actual headache phase. Now, thisheadache is characterized by a pulsatileThrobbing pain that tends to beunilateral or one-sided. Some peoplewill get it on both sides of the headand even sometimes on the back of thehead, but most commonly it's one-sided.

Now, a lot of people will alsoexperience nausea, vomiting, photophobia,which again is light sensitivity,phonophobia, sound sensitivity, and evensome people get sensitive to smells. Fewpeople will get something calledcutaneous allodynia, which is sensitivityto touch, like the skin just gets hypersensitive, and just even touching acertain area of the skin will causepain. But what is the cause of all thismiserable pain? Well, remember this waspreceded by the premonitory phase andthe aura phase with cortical spreadingdepression. And it's thought that theseprevious phases activate the trigeminalvascular system.

Now, some of you mayhave heard of the trigeminal nervebefore, and this nerve gets activatedduring a migraine, and this is going toexplain the cause of the migraine painand even help us understand thelocation. The trigeminal nerveoriginates on the brain stem and thengives rise to three main branches, henceThe prefix "tri". And I'll first show youthese branches inside the skull. Youhave the ophthalmic division, the maxillarydivision, and the mandibular division.

These are named as such because theyleave the skull and then flare outonto the face. The ophthalmic nerve, whichrefers to the eye, goes to the foreheadand around the eye. The maxillary nervegoes to the area of the maxilla or aroundthe cheek. The mandibular nerve goesto the area of the mandible. Now, thisnerve is sometimes nicknamed the greatsensory nerve of the face because if youwere to touch anywhere on your face, allof that sensation is brought into thebrain through the trigeminal nerve. Now,that is part of this story of helping usunderstand migraine pain and itslocation, but there are also some internalstructures that play a role in the painof a migraine. This is a really cooldissection that I'm about to show you.

Here, you can see we are taking a lookat the top left side of the head. Asyou can see, I can remove the scalp. Youcan take a look at the underside there.I can also remove the skull.You can look at that inside surfacethere.

This connective tissue layer is called thedura mater. And of course, we might aswell show you the brain underneath. Andas you can see, we obviously removed partof the frontal lobe there. But comingback to this dura mater. The dura matersurrounds and protects the brain. And itdoes have sensation. Specifically, it cansense pain. And guess what nerve bringsin this pain sensation? The trigeminalnerve. And so when the trigeminal nervegets activated during a migraine, it canalso sensitize the pain receptors callednociceptors in the dura mater, and thatsignal will then come into the brain asa pain signal. So now that we know theorigin of the pain coming in from thedura mater through the trigeminal nerveand into the brain, we have toanswer the question: why do I feel pain aroundthe eye, or the forehead, or in somepeople in the back of the head when thestimulus is essentially coming from thepain receptors in the dura mater that is

inside the skull? Well, that's a storyof referred pain. And to describereferred pain, we have to explainneurons converging into similar areasof the brain. So, for example, if I havea sensory neuron on my forehead thatRuns through the ophthalmic nerve branchof the trigeminal nerve. But then I alsohave a neuron coming in from the dura,which is deeper inside the skull. Butthese are converging on a similarnucleus inside the brain. That sometimestricks the brain into thinking, "Oh, thepain's coming from here on my foreheadand around the eye rather than thisdeeper structure that I hardly ever getpain signals from." And for someone thatexperiences migraine pain in the back ofthe head rather than on the front of thehead, that would just be maybe adifferent area of the dura that isgetting sensitized.

That neuron that's bringing in the pain signal fromthat part of the dura is converging witha neuron that comes from another arealike on the back of the head than asopposed to, say, like a neuron that's onthe front of the head. But this finallygets us to the final stage of amigraine. The last phase of a migraineis called the postdrome phase, and thatis essentially lingering symptoms fromthe migraine. Now, migraines can be quitedebilitating during that pain phase,because it's just this relentlesspulsatile pain that just hurts so bad.

But people also notice that it can evenhurt just to turn their head, sneeze,cough, and bend over. The next dayafter a migraine, a lot of people willrealize, "Oh, I still have some of thatpain or that residual pain from when Iturn my head quickly, or when I cough, orwhen I sneeze." The reason for thisis something called sensitization. Thenerve that we just talked about, thetrigeminal nerve and those tissues,those sensory nerve fibers and nociceptorsessentially get sensitized to stimulithat normally wouldn’t cause pain. Thisexplains why when youturn your head, it can hurt, or when yousneeze or cough, it can hurtthe day after a migraine. Luckily,this sensitization typically goes awayover the next day or so. Hopefully,you’re going to have a huge gap of timebetween this post-drome phase and yournext pre-migraine phase, aka the

beginning of your next migraine, which Iwould never wish upon anyone.

##### Release Notes

* Features:

	+ Application routing add-on support for [configuring the default NGINX ingress controller visibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/app-routing-nginx-configuration?tabs=azurecli#control-the-default-ingress-controller-configuration-when-creating-the-cluster) is now generally available in API 2025-02-01.
	+ Kubernetes events for monitoring [node auto-repair](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/node-auto-repair) actions are now available for your AKS cluster. You can ingest these events and create alerts following the same [process as other Kubernetes events](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/events?tabs=azure-cli).
	+ AKS [Kubernetes patch versions](https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/) 1.29.12, 1.29.13, 1.30.8, 1.30.9, 1.31.4, and 1.31.5 are now available.
* Preview Features:

	+ You can use the `EnableCiliumNodeSubnet` feature in preview to [create Cilium node subnet clusters](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium#option-3-assign-ip-addresses-from-the-node-subnet-preview) using Azure CNI Powered by Cilium.
	+ [Control plane metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/control-plane-metrics-monitor) are now available through Azure Monitor platform metrics in preview to monitor critical control plane components such as API server, etcd, scheculer, autoscaler, and controller-manager.
* Bug Fixes:

	+ Resolved an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4662) with Istio service mesh add-on where having multiple operations with the Lua EnvoyFilter (e.g. adding the Lua filter to call an external service and specifying the cluster referenced by Lua code) was not allowed.
	+ Fixed a bug in Azure CNI Pod Subnet Static Block Allocation mode with Cilium which caused incorrect iptables rules, leading to pod connectivity failures to DNS and IMDS.
	+ Resolved an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/issues/24109) in Azure CNI static block IP allocation mode, where the updated Azure Table client mishandled untyped numbers, causing static block node pools to be misidentified as dynamic and leading to operation failures.
	+ Fixed a bug in Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager hub cluster resource groups (FL\_ prefix resource groups) by truncating the name to avoid issues with long generated managed resource group names breaking the maximum length of resource groups.
* Behavior Changes:

	+ [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) introduced for `ama-metrics replicaset pod` in the [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview) add-on. More details about the configuration of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/internal/docs/HPA.md).
	+ Starting with Kubernetes v1.32, node subnet mode will be installed via the `azure-cns` DaemonSet, allowing for faster security updates.

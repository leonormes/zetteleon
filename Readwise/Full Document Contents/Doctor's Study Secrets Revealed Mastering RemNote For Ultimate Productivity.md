studying as a Cardiology fellow can be a lot and with very little time available I know I need a system that can be quick and predictable so today I'm going to break down exactly how I use R not to je just St hey friends welcome back to the channel in case you're new here my name is Lu I'm A cardiology fellow and today I'm going to break down exactly how I study as a Cardiology follow from Step A to Z using REM node as kind of my go-to tool now if you're not familiar with REM node I've made a full video deep diveing exactly what it is all the features but think of REM node as kind of a combination between a flashcard tool and an outline document tool and there's so much more that I can do but just a nice 

clean way for me to take notes in a very simple format if I wanted to do it as an outline or turn my notes into things like flashcards where I can easily review and have it all in one place and today I'm going to share with you both kind of what my home base looks like in rem node of how I kind of organize everything as well as my four-step process of learning anything in cardiology with very little time that you can duplicate in any aspect of your medical training and while most of the tools and REM node that I use are absolutely free there are some Pro features that I do highly recommend so if you want to actually give REM note a try completely free with all its Pro 

features click down the link on the description I'll actually give you a month free so you can go ahead and test it out but without further Ado let's jump into my study flow okay so the first thing that I want to show you guys is kind of what I consider to be my homepage or my home base of REM note as a Cardiology fellow I have more aspects of REM node that are more about my personal life as you guys can see I have a folder as my personal life that has more of my to-dos and projects that I'm working on but then I have one specifically for being a Cardiology fellow this is where I store all of the things that I learn within the field of Cardiology and also the main place that I go to when I have to review and remind 

myself of things and so just to kind of give you guys an overview of what this looks like to give some inspiration it's not that complicated kind of encouraging that if you do use R node or use any tool to keep it simple and so I really have kind of five buckets that things go into one of them is kind of a to-do list in case I just want to have a quick reminder of all the things that I need to do as a Cardiology fellow whether it's need to review a specific topic or certain chapters or apply to an email of somebody from like the admin staff whatever it may be my life as a Cardiology fellow is put into there and it has checkbox as you can see if I 

click here it'll give me kind of the different projects that I'm working on the different topics that I may have to do for a presentation on as well as extra presentations or to-do items and as I check them off I can go go ahead and quickly delete these if I needed to but the next few buckets are really the most important part this is kind of gets into our four-step process of how I help evaluate learn store and review information as a Cardiology fellow and so the first thing that I'm going to have to do is actually understand what I need to learn there's so much within Cardiology that I have to have some structured way of going to the next thing and so the first thing that I usually do is anything that comes to 

mind that ah you're not good at that or you have known nothing about that or no not enough I kind of put into this obtained bucket and so you can see if I click topics to look up it includes bunch of things that I at one point felt like I need to look into more or understand better so then when I manage a patient independently I just want to have a full kind of Deep dive into it so for example one of the things that I wanted to look at is Skip lesions critical aortic stenosis looking into the entire procedure of a Taver a maze procedure looking into a condition called halt which is a valvular process 

and some of these are kind of more basic overviews so coronary anomalies I started this one which I'll kind of demonstrate for the rest of this episode and this video on the concept of cardiac masses and imaging because right now I'm on an echo rotation so I really want to kind of review all the different modalities of evaluating what a mass is if I see it on a heart picture is it normal is it abnormal how do I know what kind of mass it is and so I'll share with this as an example we'll just kind of do this live but this is my one place where I store everything so as I'm going through this list I will have new things 

that come up and as I'm going through this list I will have things like ideally this cardiac maskk that is taken care of this week and then I will be able to move into my next bucket which is kind of like my storing bucket not everything needs me to immediately go back to it but I want to make sure I have all of my information in one place kind of like a second brain process where if I learn it once I want to have a easy goto way of refreshing so any lectures and any reading that I do are going to be in this bucket and so if I have a professor or an attending give us a conference or a lecture I'll put those in here so these are just a few examples 

of the ones that I've stored in remote if I take something from my obtained bucket and I read about it through like a review article or something then I go ahead and store it here so these are just a few of the topics that I've reviewed for example I was reading about culine and cardiovascular health and these are all the notes that I've taken on the concept I'll even show you how I did this super super quickly if I'm reading a specific article that's like an actual study then I'll go ahead and put those into here and then if there's something that doesn't actually go maybe it's just a pearl or like a formula that I wanted to know for later then I'll just put it in a miscellaneous bucket 

and there's areas for improvements of how I store this but this works for now and then finally is kind of my review question aspect of it if I'm doing board questions or if I miss something that is a topic that I want to make sure I don't ever Miss again I will turn them into the form of questions and I'll show you guys how examples of how that is but I'll put them in here and so for example if I go to things like Imaging then I'll see all of the Imaging questions that I may have missed or topics within Imaging that I may have missed in Echo and those will be there if I go to cath same thing 

if I do General Cardiology which we'll have the most it's even taking a second to load up then these are all the things that I want to make sure that I remember and these are kind of little guides and references but all of these if you are unfamiliar with REM note are essentially flash cards so if I wanted to do a flash card on this it would basically show me this and then I would have to answer this or if I wanted to know what the criteria was for doing anti-coagulation on a valve it would show me this and then it would show me this as the answer um and so that's a nice thing about REM node is again everything can look like 

an outline but it can also quickly be turned into a flash card and that is my basic structure of my homepage this is going to be super helpful especially this last tab for me to do things like board studying cuz as a cardiologist you have to take tons of board exams which is fun and so I am storing anything that I miss within the topics that it goes into so when I have to take my echo boards I just go into my Imaging and do all those questions when I want to study for my general Cardiology boards I'll just do my general Cardiology questions and so this is my nice simple way and the the last one is kind of kind of a need to sort so there's anything that I 

have not kind of moved into a specific topic but maybe I've taken notes on which happens to be a lot at some time when I have some free time I will go ahead and clean that up and put it there but this is kind of my homepage and that's going of set us up for the rest of this episode where we talk about the four-step process on how I learn anything within the field of Cardiology so before we do kind of a deep dive in remn note let's talk about those four phases so step number one is the process of evaluating exactly what you need to learn or what needs to be learned at some point step number two is actually going through the learning phase and actually trying to understand that material whether it be through a lecture 

a review article a video whatever it may be step number three is the process of story not everything needs to be reviewed or turned into a flash card some things just need to be put aside so you can reference at a moment's notice but other things are Concepts that you want to have enough repetition through they become kind of like second nature to you so having to differentiate where certain information goes for me is super important and step number four is actually the process of reviewing and have a very simple and structured way of doing so so starting with step number one which is the process of obtaining I have an obtain folder which I kind of already shared about but just having a 

system where you're reminding yourself on a weekly basis of all the things that you felt uncomfortable with a great place to start are topics that you have already kind of learned throughout the week that you know you're still uneasy about if somebody was to ask you again and if there is information that you're already forgetting within days of learning it those are perfect things to say maybe I didn't get a full deep enough dive or I need to do a deeper dive myself and add those to it so if there are patients that I'm taking care of an ICU or if I'm looking up an image of a patient and I can read their Echo but I probably don't know their entire eny of their condition very well I'll 

add this to this list it's not that these things are topics that I don't know very well but topics I want to become as close to an expert in those by reading one or two review articles and we'll talk about in the future phases of how I do that to make sure that if I ever have a patient come into my clinic with these things I feel more than confident of at least managing it or knowing where I can go back to in my library of information to remind myself what those are and so having a simple process of saying especially things you've learned that you don't feel comfortable with those should go in an obtain folder of some sorts and then if 

you come across topics whether it can be go through a book chapter so if you're in a medicine resident for example or you're in med school and you're going through your oby rotation go through a higher yield review source that you're going to be using for your exams and just look at the topic chapters and if there's specific things and maybe all of them that you feel uncomfortable with go ahead and add those to your obtain folder this a simple way that you can do this for your lectures if you're just in your normal preclinical courses is to look in your syllabi and say what topics will I be learning and put those in an chain folder so that way you know what 

topics you need to be mastering this is what I consider to be equivalent of a Hit List during my journey as a Cardiology traine that I need to master by the time that I am done or close to graduation and so my process is simple if I feel like there's something that I hear about just momentarily and I know I don't know it very well I'll just quickly grab my phone cuz remnet Works digitally on my phone as well as it does on my desktop and I'll just add those to this bucket if there's anything that comes up whether I'm reading an article and I read about something I'll just put it there and while this process is simple it's it's also extremely 

important because I just need to have a framework of what needs to be left to be learned and there's always going to be something on this list but the more I fail to add it I am going to likely have a situation where I knew I had a moment where I wanted to review that information but if I don't add it here I may just forget to review it or add it to the things that need to be reviewed and it won't be till the next time I'm faced with that topic which could be a moment where a patient needs me to know that so having this quick process where I can say crap L you don't know that very well put it in your obtain folder don't expect you're going to remember to 

put it later just do it now on your phone and then it's there for me to refer to later so step number two is the process of actually learning the information so if we take for example one of the topics that's in here which is my cardiac masses it is a topic that I need to learn for being a good EO reader I kind of already started this process where I found an article that maybe I want to go to and this is a nice example of saying that you don't always have to do the entire phase at one go especially when you're kind of more in a flexible form of training like I am or you're resident or you're a and you have topics that you need to 

know but the topics don't necessarily be Mastered by a quiz or a test a it just needs to be mastered sometime during your training and so I didn't have time to actually Deep dive into the actual topic but I found an article that looked promising and so the nice thing about remote is that you can not only put links then you can put pictures but if you use the pro feature you can also upload so for example this article right here this is the PDF to it but I don't want to have to keep going back and forth and taking notes and so the nice thing is I can go ahead and actually just upload the actual PDF file but now after uploading it this entire 18 page 

PDF that I want to review is kind of put right to the side and it's not just there for reference so let's go ahead and zoom in a little bit if I'm reading something in here if I want to highlight something and turn it into a piece of information I want to remember let's say this first paragraph for example remote nicely gives you that ability to say go ahead and highlight it you can also kind of summarize things it also just gives you the ability of turning that paragraph into an automatic flash card so that's really cool for the purposes of this example I'm just going to highlight and it Auto automatically kind of saves my highlights as if it was in 

kind of a copy paste format so if I just go control V or whatever it is command V for Mac users it will take this highlight and just go ahead and copy it into my document and the nice thing is if I'm here later on where I'm on page like seven and like crap where did I get this text from it will quickly just as soon as I click it take me back to that highlight it's really nice if you're reading studies and review articles if you're just taking nit bits through it and then you come back to those to write like a research paper or a presentation you can click on those links and it'll 

take you back to the documents so you can get a better context of what was being talked about and then the last kind of method that I like using in addition to flash cards and image inclusion is to really just make simplistic outline flashcards so for example if I was reading something and I highlighted it maybe I just want to make my own kind of questions from it so I may highlight something like this which is talking about what a fenestrated AV is and I would just write that into a form of question the nice thing about REM node is I can just quickly do a quick forward Arrow twice and anything written after that becomes kind of its own min flash card and so just like here 

I've just done fenestrated aortic valves and then I've taken and copied this paragraph into it as the answer but this is my process of actually learning the information and I'm actually trying to learn this information as I'm reading through this document because I want this to ultimately become luxious organized simplistic model of what cardiac masses are not just a big document with paragraphs that I have to relearn if I was to come back to it the most important part is that this is something that is likely going to take me a few settings it's probably not going to be a 20-minute quickly learn kind of concept it's 18 Pages first of 

all and if at any point I realize that this document is not good enough for the topic or too involve I'll just find another article or video that's going to help you learn this better and then add that to this big outline that I've created now step number three is storing this information I don't want at some point to just have a big list of everything I've reviewed and just in one place and so you have to kind of be a little bit focused on being organizational or having a process initially so that way it's much easier to come back to things and so as I'm learning sometimes I try to ask myself one question is like what topics would 

this easily come back into and the nice thing about remote is that you can make things into references or tags where I can look up something like apib or Cad and find all the topics I've written with within those topics I just have to tag them as such it's very similar as like the tags within anky things like Quizlet have their own stuff and so one of ways you can do this is you can just quickly go into the title and just tag it so if you do two hashtags this will go ahead and tag it to whatever you want now I have tons that I've used before but cardiac masses doesn't necessarily fit within one of them so so it may fit 

with an echo and so I have an echo tag and so I'm just going to put it within there and then so when I'm creating my tags I may think of things like Echoes or Imaging and so let's see if I have an Imaging tag quite yet and doesn't look like it so I'm just going to go ahead and create one and so now this is going to have a tag for Echo and imaging and then I'm just going to add one more for things like masses in case that's what I think of looking for um later on and so now I can see under this tab I have three tags 

added to this so if I ever typed in topic of Echoes or Imaging or mask then it would show me anything in this outline for sure as well as any other outlines that had one of these tags this would show up now the next thing after putting tags and references is actually moving things and organizing them after I'm done so let to say for example that I've actually finished reviewing things on this cardiac math topic I can just go ahead and take it out of the topics to look for and just move it into my lectures and reading and then I can choose within that what I want to move 

it as so let's just say it's going to be something that I'm going to consider that I read about like through a review article if it was something that I had obtained through a lecture that somebody had given to me I'd put it here if it was something I learned by reading a study then I would put it here most of the things I would put in the reading aspect um with any pertinent tags that it has and again this is really nice because you can go ahead and just kind of go into the sidebar and type in anything so I can type in mask and it's going to show me this right here and then likely it's going to show me all of the tags or all the documents that have 

mass tagged into them for our purposes it's just this one but if I did the same thing for Imaging or Echo it would show me all the documents including the cardiac massis one plus anything else which is really nice and as kind of a a teaser as you can see it allows me to do any flash cards on this tag so if I typed in imaging and I was on my echo rotation which I'm on I could do all the flash cards tagged with topics on Echoes for anything I have if I was on my cath rotation EP I could do flashcards on that topic there really allows you to kind of hone in on one topic that you 

need to learn and so as you're adding information as you're adding content to these tags over time it grows the amount of questions you can ask without having to move things around like an ay tech for example so it makes things really easy of just asking specific questions over time now the final step is the aspect of review now we'll get into how I do flashcards which is pretty simple but sometimes you may realize that maybe there's a topic that youve forgotten you go back into your second brain and you go through something like your reading and let's say I'm looking at at this topic of LP little a which is an 

important topic in the idea of preventative Cardiology and Cad and so some of these things are not flash cards right so if I wanted as I'm reviewing them let's say I'm like okay I I shouldn't forget that in the future let's just make that into a flash card the nice thing is that I can just go ahead and take some of these things into flash cards by just doing kind of a double tap clicking enter and now as you can see anything with this arrow pointing down anything below it is kind of a multi-step flash card so what that means is that if this is the question it's it's going to ask me each of these 

as if it's an individual one so if we click preview right here we can see that it's going to take the mainline as a question and it's going to ask me one of the bullet points as kind of an answer if I know it or not and so easily sometimes what I can do is I can just transition what I wrote up here and type it as a question to help me kind of understand what I'm going for so I can talk about how does number a repeats affect l a risk something like that and then turn that into a flash CB but is doing either two arrows forward which 

just makes a nice simple back forward flash card or if you add an enter to it it makes kind of a multi-step flash card so all of your bullet points are then an individual question or an answer to the question which I like more because it allows me to ask more things and then really differentiate which one I don't know out of those three items for example so that is kind of first part of reviewing is if I'm going back to a topic reviewing it and realize man I really should know that and I haven't made that into a flash card I'll quickly do so as well as kind of add any tags that I feel like irrelevant and the second part is actually doing the questions themselves now as a Cardiology 

fellow I can't be stuck doing anky e or remote for an hour a day I just don't have the time and so sometimes what I'll do is I'll pick a certain amount of questions that I'll do instead and then just go into my question and board prep um area and go through here or again if I was on my EP rotation for example but maybe I want to do anything beyond just the questions that I put within my EP folder I can just go and type in within search electrophysiology and it would show me any flash card that I've tagged is electrophysiology in including these ones but I usually will do a certain 

amount of questions per day just to keep it simple so for the process here I can choose to go into one of these individual ones or if I wanted to I can just do an entire kind of flash card thing where I can just go into here and just do flashcards practice with space repetition and then it will start showing me questions so as here you can see here's a question that comes from my EP folder about the different pacemaker modes and so I can go ahead and click show answer it's going to show me the different kind of things it even gives me some different things from their AI near tutor in case I wanted to use it 

but if I didn't remember these four answers I could just click forget just like eny very similar now it's going to ask me a question about Critical Care um and I can do these and this is an example of what a multi-step question looks like so if there's multiple things involved I can say the ones that I didn't get correctly just to help me understand and it's going to give me some pneumonics to memorize things potentially but I'm just going to say that I partially recall this but usually my goal is to do about 10 to 20 questions or no more than 10 to 15 minutes a review and that's simply enough time for me to do enough 

questions within my question block that I can feel like I'm always making progress I know there's tons of flash cards I have not touched but again that's not the goal there's no board exam that I have in a week or quiz coming up I just need to get a little bit better at Cardiology every day you know learn a little bit more I need to review a little bit more and that helps boost up my knowledge and I want to do this without becoming a process that I dread and so this system of understanding and evaluating what I need to learn of actually learning it organizing it in a very simplistic format and then revie viewing it in a very simplistic format is my four step 

process that I use as a Cardiology fellow that I use Remo for and it works extremely well now I know that some of you guys are watching this video because you're just interested in what it looks like to study as a Cardiology fellow and some of you guys are probably understanding how you can use remote for your own medical Journey so hopefully that gives you a little bit of a framework of how you can learn anything in medicine through a very simplistic four-step process but just having a simple system that you can easily go and replicate is really the most important thing I think remote does a really good job of allowing you to put everything in one place a little bit better actually a lot better than Ani and I'm a big an fan 

so if you're interested in checking out remote I'll put a link Down Below in the description that would also give you a free month trial of all the pro features including uploading an entire document and being able to annotate it which I think is super super nice and if you have questions about REM node or specific features or concepts that you want me to include in future episodes and videos go ahead and let me know in the comment section down below but also let me know what from this video did you guys feel that you would use in your own kind of day-to-day studying in medicine what things probably wouldn't work for you really curious so let me in the comment section down below and then if 

you did enjoy this episode then check out this full episode of exactly how I would use remote as a medical student to just help me get the best grades possible but as always my friends hopefully I was a little help to you guys on your journey as always thank you so much for being a part of mine I'll see you guys in the next one peace

don't need it just click skip tutorial once skip your account is created and you can start using REM node how does REM node work right now you're seeing the main menu of the app let's explore all the options it offers for efficient note taking and studying first notice the menu on the left we'll go through each submenu and its sections the all nodes section shows all your created notes documents folders and tags we've covered this in other videos but here you can also up load files like PDFs or 

PowerPoints or paste YouTube link you can upload directly or create a new document using the top right button next we have a section for today's notes or creating new notes for today and next up are flashcards a super important feature for studying you can create various types of flash card when you use them they help you learn for example you might ask what's the most important part of a car you'd make a flash card with engine as the answer the word engine would be hidden helping you practice 

recalling the correct answer you can create many such flash cards if you want to learn how to use this for studying check out our flashcards video we've also added an AI learning tools section which we cover in another video lastly there's a section for all your folders creating new spaces folders and documents to work efficiently that's a brief overview of how end Dog Works what it's for and its features how can we efficiently use flash cards in red node I have a document here showing different typ of flash cards which I'll 

demonstrate today first you see the flash card type name here and examples below I'll show you each type and how to create them yourself let's start with the basic flash card what's its purpose well you put a word in front then an arrow and The Words Answer how do we insert this Arrow how do we make this Arrow appear simply type equals twice and the arrow will point right this hides the section on the right side in the preview you see good morning and the hidden part click show Answer to reveal 

it next we have this one which is the same but in Reverse how do we do the same thing but in Reverse well instead of using equal and equal we use less than symbols this makes the arrow point left hiding the second word instead of the first as you can see this is how all flash cards work first it shows you one side then the other allowing you to study to give you an idea it initially hides this part when I click show answer we have this answer section here this way the program learns what you need to re enforce more or less with these flash 

cards the next flash card is Target concept it does the same as above but for both sides sometimes it'll hide the front other times the back this one's simple to add just put two colons here and it'll show up like this and this so what happens then sometimes it'll appear this way and other times it'll show up differently next is Target descriptor it's like the basic one but it puts the front part in italic how do you add this one you use semicolons semicolons next is Target close these cards hide the 

Bold word if I show an example you can see it's hiding the word I put how do we do this just put two brackets add the word and that's it the second to last I'll show you is the multiple choice card it's very interesting this one lets us choose between a b c d but I haven't set it up properly yet here we need to start with the question what's the largest planet in the solar system then we'd put greater than symbols followed by a in parentheses for the first answer answer right the first option we enter 

will be the correct one right if I hit tab now it's already formatted the text with the new system because it detects the correct answer Jupiter is the largest so we hit tab okay this answer below now moves up here and we're set with the choose option we click preview and here we can select which answer is correct obviously don't always make this one the correct answer okay you can change it move things around and set different options as correct just hit 

enter to add another hook and choose which one's correct and which is incorrect lastly there are image occlusion cards where you put an image and hide the keyword for example I put a heart photo to make it click the three dots then make image occlusion flash card then control click and drag to hide part it creates a new card to hide those letters as you see it hides this part we say which is correct and the flash card is done simple so these are all the 

flash cards you have in the flash card section you'll see stats on your progress which ones you fail most which ones you do best practice them to study more efficiently for any exam let's check out those AI options added to Red Dot and see how they can help with our task first we'll try creating cards as you can see we have all these functionalities available we've got PDF summaries YouTube reading text to card and more we've got everything here to have a bluff so let's see how this guide works and if it can really help us the first first thing we'll do is input some 

tech from all this information taken from our notes right let's see if it can generate flash cards for us okay as you can see it's already starting with the flash cards so far it seems to have only made basic flash cards it hasn't created any complex flash cards yet but hey it did make the flash cards and it used all the content I provided so pretty good for a first attempt so if you want to make some quick flashcards there to study quickly without having to make them by hand it can be really useful and 

it seems we can also have it make a quiz besides cards it can generate multiple choice quizzes now after giving it a different flash card Well a different info to make the flash cards it's supposed to create a multiple choice now let's see if it works I don't get why it says it made an eia quiz because it hasn't made a multiple choice quiz or I'm not seeing it honestly so for now it hasn't really done it weird YouTube card let's see if this one works let's see how it does let's hit create this is our 

Evernote tutorial another app for taking different notes not for studying CRM more but let's see if it really pulls the info oh my goodness right I can't believe it everything I say is spot on what an amazing script right well it seems to be doing quite well let's see sharing for the sake of sharing this option is pretty incredible I really liked it because it does all this for you and you can easily extract info from any video and have it written out clearly I mean wow could keep making 

cards here all day but I just want to try the YouTube quiz lastly which should make a quiz automatically with this info so all right today I'm supposedly doing highlight oops we ran out of tokens but honestly the YouTube one and the AI cards Creator pretty incredible this way you can create with AI in a much simpler manner all of your cards so now you know how to use AI with this tool easily right let's see how we can organize efficiently within REM node we'll click create to make a folder document or 

upload a file we'll create a document which gives us various options we can share docs add favorites and Export or print them the key is to title it like notes and explore options we have bullet notes for basic note taking and list like a shopping list to check off completed items I'll use bullet notes to show you a simple organizing method first let's look at how the program works you'd have the first section here I'd write the first part of the subject I'm working on and within sections there are often subsections we hit enter and 

to create subsections within this section we simply press tab as you can see it's quickly creating that subsection just like what you're seeing on screen now we just need to type something I hit enter still in the subsection if I hit it again I stay in the subsection this can go on and if I hit enter twice I automatically exit the subsection the thing is Within These sections these Rems they're all Rems I can create documents I just click Zoom save for bullet notes then up here on 

the right I click the three dots hit pin to sidebar and I've instantly turned this into a document if I exit and return to points this is automatically marked as a document as you can see I can do this with any item I want I can also pin it to the Side Bar turning it into a document we now have one document another document and in the admin section we can click turn into document at the top we've made it a document and can change its icon for example if we use the f folder icon it becomes a 

folder with different sections inside if I click here I hide these sections clicking open shows or hides all subsections some useful tips for example if we type Administration i' imagine we write several lines here and type Administration I'll show you how to create a link that finds all sections containing that word Administration to create a link we use square brackets don't confuse these with other types of brackets we use them twice to create a new link we'll put the name we want for the link when we click it it'll 

automatically find all references to this name in our notes quickly locating every place we've saved this word this also works in documents as you can see here I have an admin view that finds references from various documents it's useful for managing multiple documents on the same topic lastly you can use hashtags to tag items in Rems for example hash science automatically add science tags inside you'll find all your tagged sections this makes it easy to find matching words and organize content 

more efficiently with these organization tips you now know how to start using this amazing platform it'll definitely improve your study methods and be incredibly helpful the question we always ask is how much does it cost to use this app first remote is free to use but if you want better study options more personalized and efficient there are paid plans we'll look at now the free plan offers unlimited notes flashcards and synced devices you can add three PDFs five scars occlusion

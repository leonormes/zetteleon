## Full Document
hello everyone so today I'm going to show you how you can jailbreak your Kindle device using the new WinterBreak method so this jailbreak has come recently in 2025 and as of now it supports all the versions of the Kindle and I hope it will support all the versions of Kindle until and unless Amazon actually fixes the exploit by any 

kind of update so right now my Kindle is in latest version so this is at 2019 Kindle Basic Kids Edition the process will be the same for all the Kindle devices so if I go into my device options and then software updates as you can see my Kindle is in 5.7.1 right now so I have what Wi-Fi 

turned on and my Kindle is registered with my account so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my computer screen and open the page which describes the method for jailbreaking Kindle so for this as you can see in my device I have opened two windows 

one is my file manager and another is my browser so as you can see uh it says first of all you need a PC then the Kindle must be registered and the Kindle must have a valid internet connection so first of all what I have to do is I have to download the latest WinterBreak release and I have already downloaded it in here as you can see downloaded and extracted 

so this is ready and then I have to turn on airplane mode on my Kindle so I'm going to do this I'm going to go to settings and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and then airplane mode and then turn it on okay now it says me to plug the Kindle into my computer so I'm going to plug this into my computer by the USB 

cable so I'm going to plug it in okay now as you can see it's plugged in so the lights are turned off and it's showing that USB drive mode okay so now I'm going to open my File Explorer and then open the Kindle directory so these these are the things 

in my Kindle which are documents and then fonts these are all default folders what I have to do is I have to extract the contents of the winter break file into my Kindle so I have already extracted all the files so I'm going to copy this copy all these into my Kindle root directory 

so as you can see I have copied all of them now I have to do is I have to eject the Kindle from my computer and I'm going to eject this and plug out my Kindle okay so now I have to reboot my Kindle okay so I'm going to reboot it 

so I'm going to go to my settings and then go to device options okay here I can see that this is the restart option and I'm going to click on it and restart so now I'll wait for the Kindle to reboot [Music] 

[Music] it will take some time I'm going to wait [Music] [Music] 

as you can see it's [Music] rebooting the reboot Time actually depends on the Kindle model since 

uh this one is an older Kindle that's why it takes some time to [Music] reboot 

[Music] [Music] 

[Music] okay now that the Kindle is rebooted now what I'm going to do is I have to go to the store 

so I'll open store now it will ask me to turn off airplane mode and I'm going to do this I have to click [Music] yes so as you can see the jailbreak process is loading what I have to do is I have to click on this icon or image 

okay so now the jailbreak process has started so as you can see the last line which is saying finished installing jailbreak please install hot fix now so the Kindle is already jailbroken now the jailbreak is not persistent on this by default so what we have to do is we have to install the HotFix so that the jailbreak is persistent on this device I mean when you reboot then the jailbreak 

will stay unless uh when you reboot the Kindle you have to jailbreak every time when you turn on the Kindle so I'm going to go to the next process for installing the hot fix now let's get back to my computer screen as you can see this process has been finished so I'm going to go to click on this post jailbreak [Music] 

now okay so once you have jailbroken your Kindle there are still some extremely important steps you have to do so I have to set up hot fix now click on this and it will show me the instruction to set up the hot [Music] fix okay so first of all I have to download the latest hot fix from here 

so if I click on the download hot [Music] fix okay so I have just downloaded the HotFix fix and I'll place the HotFix in here so this is my HotFix so as you can see this is the HotFix file I have just downloaded it's on my computer 

now what I'm going to do is I have to connect my Kindle to the PC again so in this state I have to connect this to the USB cable and as you can see it's saying USB drive mode and now I'm going to go to my file explorer open the Kinder drive and then I have to copy the Update- 

HotFixUniversalDotBin which I have just downloaded to my Kindle's root folder so I'll copy this and then paste it into the Kindle's root folder okay now it's done so I have to eject and and then unplug the 

Kindle okay I'm going to unplug it now I have to go to settings I'll go to home from here and [Music] then I'll cut this and I'll go to settings as you can see there are some 

overlay related to Kindle jailbreak process no worry about that so I'm going to go to [Music] settings and then go to device options and then software updates as you can see it's asking me to update the software so I'm going to click on [Music] update now let's wait [Music] 

okay now the Kindle is restarting the update process has already started okay it's saying update succeeded the Kindle will restart so I'm going to wait for that 

[Music] [Music] the Kindle is rest starting as you can 

see [Music] 

[Music] it's already done now wait for the final touch 

[Music] [Music] sh [Music] 

[Music] oh okay the Kindle has done 

restarting now here as you can see if you have any books or if you don't have any books you will see that a new book has appeared which is named run HotFix by HackerDude so this new book here as you can see we have to click on this so I'm going to click on this so it it will now start running the 

HotFix as you can see the Kindle is restarting so it will actually install the HotFix on your device so we will again wait for the Kindle to [Music] restart also as per the documentation says you will need to run the HotFix after every up it 

[Music] [Music] [Music] 

[Music] 

[Music] [Music] 

[Music] as you can see it's almost [Music] done the process is a bit slow so we will wait [Music] 

the screen has become blank I think it will show content soon okay so as you can see the Kindle has been restarted now we have to go to the next process which is installing KUAL on our Kindle so that we can install HomeBrew apps and other benefits so let's go back to my computer screen as you can see we 

have already finished this process which is installing HotFix now we have to go to the next process which is install KUAL and MRPI [Music] so it's asking us to download MRPI and then download QUAL (Coplate) or download KUAL so for my device I'll install KUAL Coplate because for latest Kindles uh 

it's better to install because the original KUAL might not work I don't know much about this but uh I will install the KUAL (Coplate) so as you can see inside my Post Jailbreak folder I have already downloaded the KUAL (Coplate) and MRPI so I have downloaded the MRP content and then extracted in here and I have also downloaded the QUAL 

contents and extracted in here so as you can see the installation guide says I have to connect my Kindle again to my PC so I'll do [Music] that okay now it's again in USB drive mode and I have to open my Kindle directory 

so what I'm going to do is I have to copy the extensions and MR Packages folder from the MR Package Installer or MRPI to the root of my Kindle so from the MRPI folder I will copy and then paste this two folders into the Kindle's through [Music] directory okay now it's 

done now I will have to move the update QUAL Booklet Install Bin this file to the MR packages folder on my Kindle so I'm going to go to MRPI folder and then go back to my QUAL folder as you can see Update QUAL Booklet and then a code number and then Install 

Dot Bin so this is the file I have to copy only this file and then I have to go to the MR packages which is here inside my Kindle root directory because I have just copied this folder so this folder is empty right now and I have to paste that thing in here so if I see as you can see it's already done 

pasting so I have to now eject and unplug the Kindle that I'm going to do okay now after unplugging I have to go to the Kindle search option this is a search bar I have to go in here and 

type this semicolon and then log space MRPI just like this you have to type in semicolon log space MRPI (;log mrpi) and then click on enter as you can see it's saying "Hush 

Little Baby" so that means the installation of QUAL has been started already as you can see the screen goes blank and there are some icons on the screen and it's saying success done restarting UI so I'm going to wait for this to restart [Music] 

okay so it says selected application could not be started please try again I'm going to close this [Music] 

I don't know why it shows this error but let's wait to restart the [Music] UI maybe there is some issue [Music] 

[Music] okay now that it's restarted the UI as you can see here there is a book named QUAL [Music] 

so I'm going to open this schol okay so as you can see we have successfully installed QUAL on our Kindle and our Kindle is already jailbroken so this was the tutorial in future tutorial I might show how you can install HomeBrew apps and other things and other customizations on your Kindle so this is it for now thank you so much

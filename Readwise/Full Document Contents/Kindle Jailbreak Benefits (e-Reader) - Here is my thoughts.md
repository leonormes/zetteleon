Okay, so in this video, we will talk aboutsome benefits of jailbreaking anAmazon Kindle e-reader. Here, I have aAmazon Kindle Paperwhite SignatureEdition, Generation 11, Paperwhite 5, andhere we have a Kindle Basic from[Music].2022, Generation 11. I think bothof these are already jailbroken with aWinterBreak jailbreak. You can jailbreakany Kindle now with a WinterBreakjailbreak. I have a video on my channelon how to do that. So, of course, thebiggest benefit of jailbreaking aKindle is that you get free fromAmazon. You are not dependent on Amazonanymore; you can use your Kindle withoutAmazon. You can have your books on itwithout Amazon having them on theirservers. You can still sync the progressbetween all your devices without Amazonservers, and you can also access all yourfiles on your Kindle now. So you don’tneed to have the protected version ofall the files; you can now see the bookson your device. You can transfer yourbooks from your computer to your Kindle

and so on, without Amazon. You can alsonow use ePub files directly without the needto convert them. Amazon converts all yourEO files, when you transfer them to yourKindle, but now you can use EO fileswithout transfer, and you have a lot ofmore freedom. You can, for example, nowchoose your margins when reading booksexactly how you want them, and much, muchmore. You can install a lot ofdictionaries, so for example, for me, I cannow use Swedish dictionaries. Swedish toSwedish dictionaries are not availablefor Kindle from Amazon, but nowwhen I have jailbroken it, I can installSwedishdictionaries. So, for example, if I want toknow what this is, I can long-press onthat word, and it starts searching all thedictionaries I have installed—11 of themare installed. So here you see, noresults on that word, though, but, uh,maybe that was a bad word, but you canalso search from Wikipedia here. So now Iget that word from Wikipedia in Swedish.

Mylanguage is reallynice. Uh, that was not so good that Ididn’t find anything inthe dictionary, but maybe we can do thatword. I don’t know; we’ll see in thedictionary. You see here, now it starts onEnglish dictionary. This is the result.

From one of seven, as you see there, Ican read this, and Ican go through differentworks. What this is, as you cansee, and I can also do a Wikipedia searchfor that, and then I get even images.Sometimes, as you see there, I got animage that's reallynice. Now, when we have opened this,you can also say one of the hugebenefits for me withjailbreaking a Kindle is that you canrun alternative software for readingebooks. So here we have C-Readerinstalled, and I have C-Reader on all mydevices. I have C-Reader on my Kobodevices, and I have them on my Android-basedeReaders like Unix Books, Palma, and the

Big Me devices. I also have C-Readeron Androidphones, so I can have all my books insync on all my devices. I use analternative software for readinginstalled on my eBook readers. So, after Ijailbreak the Kindle, I can nowinstall C-Reader, and you see how muchbetter C-Reader is. For example, yousee here we have a status bar with a lotmore information, and you can design andcustomize this status bar exactly howYou want it, you can have the informationyou want down here. So, for example, I haveread59%. I have 500 pages left of the book.

It will take 7 hours and 44 minutes toread the rest of the book in the readingprogress I have at the moment,and how many pages I read per minute.I have seven pages left of the chapter.To read those seven pageswill take six minutes. Thebrightness of the front light is at themoment, 22%.The NightLight is0%, and I have Wi-Fi on. The time atthe moment is12:58. You can do so much morewith this. I already showed you thedictionaries. I can install whatever Ifind on the internet, and I can install thosedictionaries on my Kindle. I have 11of them, but you can also see somereading stats by tapping here. I can seethe reading stats. I started this bookseven daysago, and I've read60%, and so on. You can see a lot ofmore statistics with this book. I canalso see battery statistics by clicking.

Down here, you can see that I have 62%left of thebattery, and I've read in thissession for 11 minutes, it saysand it changes per hourby 2%, but the battery haslasted 7 days already after the lastcharge, and I have 14 days left before Ineed to charge itagain, as you see there. So here we havesome battery statistics too, and you cando so much more here.

We can go tothe DI set up, we havesome customizations you can integrate Calibre,so if you use Calibre for yourlibrary of books, you can do so here withCalibre. You can connect to yourCalibre libraryhere, for example, and you can do somewireless transfers from Calibre on yourcomputer. You can transfer bookswirelessly to yourKindle really easily,and from this menu, you can also do someCalibre setup that's really nice.You can have, for example, OPDSsearches,so you can search your Calibrelibrary.

All your caliber books on the Kindle,you can click on a book to open it anddownload it to your Kindle.I haven’t set that up yet, but soon Iwill. I have that on my Kobo devicesrunning C reader, but on this Kindle, Ihaven’t done that yet. But you can if youwant, and, uh, more tools as you see here,you have plugins. You can install pluginsfrom the net for co-reader. It's really easyas you see here, and you can do so muchmore. You can install different fonts,like you seehere. I have eight pages offonts. As you see here, I installed a lot

offonts. Yes, you can do that withoutjailbreaking, but I will just show thatyou can do that here too, and you can doa lot of styletweaks. As you see here, when I’m reading,you see that the margins are a lotsmaller than when you’re reading on theAmazon Kindle software withoutjailbreaking, and you can do all thatin settings. Uh, down here, so you can clickhere and you see here you can set thecontrast, font weight, font tinting, fontkernel. You can do a lot more settings.

Like this, you can adjust font size, word spacing, and word expansion.You can set line spacing and everything you wantwith these settings. If youlong press on a setting, you can havethat as a defaultsetting. For example, if you go hereand set random mode to book, you canlong press on that to set it asdefault. As you see there, now I havethat random mode on all the books I openin the co-reader.

If we go up here, you can go to the co-Reader Library. I only have onebook on this Kindle yet, but I can adda lot of books here by wireless transferfrom Calibre, for example, or I can addthem manually with a cable from acomputer to the C-reader folder withbooks—really nice! I can long presson a book to see a lot of options. I canaccess book information, book description, forexample. I can add them tocollections, reset the reading I havedone, change the book cover, and soon. Really nice!

One thing I can do also, if you're reading and want to seethe cover, is press here.

To see the cover as you see wherever I am in the book, I can do that. Also,when I turn off due to sleep mode, I get thecover of the book immediately from co-reader,and then I can customize what the information on the sleep screen should be. As you see here,59% — 7 hours and 45 minutes left to read, 62% battery left. I have done that customization myself,so you can add exactly what you want for information down here. It works great.As I said before, you can also do some progress sync by going here,progress sync, and pull progress from other devices.

Now, then I get on the same page as on the other devices, and you can, of course, set that to be automatic.And much more, as you see here, you can use a custom sync server.You need to be logged in with the same account on all the devices. Sync behavior, for example,you can add sync to new estate or sync old estate.

Disabled? You can document matching method. I always use file name because binary only needsthat to work.

To be identical, and they don't get that if you have an Android device, because Ihave coded on other devices too thatdon't work, unfortunately. But thenagain, I just rename all my files so theyhave the exact same name. So I use thefile name option to sync the progresswith instead. And you can, of course, do some other stuff that's cool. You canhighlights here; for example, you canchoose the highlights and how theyshould be formatted. You can also exporthighlights. You can export to allthe notes in the current book, or all notesin your whole library. You can chooseformats and services that you will

export to HTML, markdown, and text. Ihave chosen. But if you have, for example,Readwise, you can use that next Cloud,Notes My Clippings is the same filethat Amazonuses. For example, Joplin is an open-source software for textfiles, so you can do a lot more withhighlights when jailbreaking your Kindletoo. I guess I can talk and talkabout how many more benefits there are withCreader, for example; but I have a lotof videos on my channel about Creader.

So you can have that and watch theminstead for this video to see all thebenefits with C-Reader because one hugebenefit with C-Reader is also that theyare the same on any device. You have thesame settings; you have everything, allthe features the same on all devices. Nodifference, so you can have everythinglook the same on all your devices. Nomatter if it's a Kobo, an Unix books,a big me device, or a Kindle. Ifyou run C-Reader, everything is thesame. That's nice! As you can see here, Ihave done some different stuff with thestatus bar. I have no chapter marks here,as you see on the smaller Kindle Basic. Ionly have the reading progress and alsowhere I start reading this session ismarked, for example, because this is asmaller device. I decided to do that, andanother huge benefit that I forgot totalk about was that now you can do asexactly with a Kindle as with a Kobodevice. You can now swipe at the side ofthe Kindle toraisethe brightness of the frontlight. On this side, I can raise it by doingthis, as you see there, or I can lower thefront light by doing this. This works on

Cobo devices run on all devices that useAndroid. I can also have on the paperwhite, and I can have the warm light set bydoing this as yousee. It's really cool to use Swipe to dothat. Ithink it works great on the Kindle basic. Ican only adjustthe brightness of the front lightbecause this doesn’t have any warm light,so I can swipe here to raise or lowerthe front light, as you see, but I can’tdo thisswipe. So, if the device, the e-reader,supports both front light and nightlight, then you can swipe on bothsides. I think that’s enough for thisvideo about the benefits. I think byjailbreaking a Kindle, the co-reader is the most important thing forme personally. I also get rid ofAmazon; I don’t need to upload my booksto Amazon, or my highlights to Amazon, or mynotes, and so on. Now I don’tneed to do that anymore because I canuse co-reader software, for example, forreading and a lotmore. Okay, so I think that’s enoughfor this video.

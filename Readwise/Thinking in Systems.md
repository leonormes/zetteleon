## Highlights
- Because of feedback delays within complex systems, by the time a problem becomes apparent it may be unnecessarily difficult to solve. — A stitch in time saves nine. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=202))
    - Note: [[Engineering Excellence MOC]]
- According to the competitive exclusion principle, if a reinforcing feedback loop rewards the winner of a competition with the means to win further competitions, the result will be the elimination of all but a few competitors. — For he that hath, to him shall be given; and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath (Mark 4:25) or —The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=204))
- A diverse system with multiple pathways and redundancies is more stable and less vulnerable to external shock than a uniform system with little diversity. — Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=208))
- Ever since the Industrial Revolution, Western society has benefited from science, logic, and reductionism over intuition and holism. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=211))
    - Note: I spend a lot of my time trying to break things down into simple and independent parts. It makes things easier to comprehend. But does this lead to understanding? Parts affect each other
- Because they are embedded in larger systems, however, some of our “solutions” have created further problems. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=216))
    - Note: When trying to solve the delivery of value problem
- No one deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist nonetheless. That is because they are intrinsically systems problems—undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them. They will yield only as we reclaim our intuition, stop casting blame, see the system as the source of its own problems, and find the courage and wisdom to restructure it. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=219))
    - Note: No one wants bad code. We all try to mitigate it. But it persists
- don’t think the systems way of seeing is better than the reductionist way of thinking. I think it’s complementary, and therefore revealing. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=260))
- A system isn’t just any old collection of things. A system* is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something. If you look at that definition closely for a minute, you can see that a system must consist of three kinds of things: elements, interconnections, and a function or purpose. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=294))
- A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=313))
- You can see from these examples that there is an integrity or wholeness about a system and an active set of mechanisms to maintain that integrity. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=315))
- You can divide elements into sub-elements and then sub-sub-elements. Pretty soon you lose sight of the system. As the saying goes, you can’t see the forest for the trees. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=329))
    - Tags: [[systems]] 
- Before going too far in that direction, it’s a good idea to stop dissecting out elements and to start looking for the interconnections, the relationships that hold the elements together. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=339))
    - Note: I need to start looking more at the interconnections between the functions
- Many interconnections are flows of information—signals that go to decision points or action points within a system. These kinds of interconnections are often harder to see, but the system reveals them to those who look. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=355))
    - Note: This is interesting and links to concepts on the theory of information. Different types of information different levels of detail and redundancy
- (Note that information about the existence of a problem may be necessary but not sufficient to trigger action—information about resources, incentives, and consequences is necessary too.) ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=359))
    - Note: information can trigger action. the type and quality of that info determines the type of effectiveness of that action
- If information-based relationships are hard to see, functions or purposes are even harder. A system’s function or purpose is not necessarily spoken, written, or expressed explicitly, except through the operation of the system. The best way to deduce the system’s purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=361))
- Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=367))
- The word function is generally used for a nonhuman system, the word purpose for a human one, but the distinction is not absolute, since so many systems have both human and nonhuman elements. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=369))
- In fact, one of the most frustrating aspects of systems is that the purposes of subunits may add up to an overall behavior that no one wants. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=376))
- Keeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of successful systems. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=389))
- system generally goes on being itself, changing only slowly if at all, even with complete substitutions of its elements—as long as its interconnections and purposes remain intact. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=397))
- The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=399))
- A change in purpose changes a system profoundly, even if every element and interconnection remains the same. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=410))
- To ask whether elements, interconnections, or purposes are most important in a system is to ask an unsystemic question. All are essential. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=411))
- All have their roles. But the least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=412))
- A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the system. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=431))
- A feedback loop is a closed chain of causal connections from a stock, through a set of decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are dependent on the level of the stock, and back again through a flow to change the stock. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=576))
- This kind of stabilizing, goal-seeking, regulating loop is called a balancing feedback loop, so I put a B inside the loop in the diagram. Balancing feedback loops are goal-seeking or stability-seeking. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=602))
- The information delivered by a feedback loop—even nonphysical feedback—can only affect future behavior; it can’t deliver a signal fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback. Even nonphysical information takes time to feedback into the system. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=774))
- Although you may have a strong opinion about it, there’s no way to prove you’re right until the future actually happens. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=871))
- Bounded rationality: The logic that leads to decisions or actions that make sense within one part of a system but are not reasonable within a broader context or when seen as a part of the wider system. ([Location 3265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3265))

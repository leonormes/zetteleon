## Highlights
- The sensation of fullness came in a way I had never experienced before—not the kind of stuffed, uncomfortable fullness from overeating, but a gentle, calm signal from my body saying, "That’s enough." It was like my body finally had a voice, and I could actually hear it. For the first time in my life, I could hear my body whisper, instead of shouting over it with cravings and guilt.

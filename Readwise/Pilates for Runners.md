## Highlights
- Running is a repetitive activity. This means that every time you run you will be overusing some of your muscles, while others will be underused. Unfortunately, this overuse can cause muscular imbalances, which could turn into injury. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=68))
- So you need to make those vulnerable areas stronger and better able to deal with the stress of running. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=72))
- At the side of your waist are your internal and external oblique muscles, and then on top of the deep TVA sits the more superficial rectus abdominis muscle, the potential ‘six pack’. But it’s the deep TVA that we are most interested in engaging and focusing on when performing Pilates exercises. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=89))
- Kimitake Sato and M. Mokha’s research into core strength training and running at Barry University, Florida concluded that core strength training was indeed important in improving running speed and performance. The participants in their study completed a six-week core strength-training programme and experienced a significant improvement in their 5k times, as opposed to no increase in speed for the control group.

- In order to balance well, you have to develop balance, or proprioception (the ability to sense the position, location and orientation of your limbs in space). This ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=116))
- Proprioceptive/neuromuscular training (balance, coordination) was shown in a review of seven high-quality research studies by the Department of Sports Medicine, Goethe University, Frankfurt, to reduce incidence of lower limb injuries in sports that involve pivoting, running or jumping. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=128))
- How many of you suffer from tight hamstrings or tight calf muscles after running? Do you just go and have a shower, or sit back down at your desk and don’t move for hours? These bad habits shorten the hamstrings even more, and tight hamstrings will in turn shorten each of your running strides. Pilates improves flexibility by constantly lengthening the muscles during the exercises. In order that you can run well, you need your muscles to be long enough to withstand the full range of movement that this repetitive activity requires – think how many times these muscles have to contract.

- He called this method of body conditioning ‘Contrology’. Joseph Pilates observed that if a body was misaligned or weak in a particular area, then muscles and joints would overcompensate in some way, often causing injuries. He continued to develop and refine his exercises, concentrating on physical remedies for postural misalignments. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=185))
- Concentrate on the correct movements each time you exercise, lest you do them improperly. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=209))
- Breathing Quite simply, we need to breathe to live. But how well do we actually breathe? In Pilates the lateral thoracic breathing helps the exercise to flow, aids concentration and allows the body to relax into the movement. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=220))
- By activating the deep transversus abdominis muscle (TVA) and pelvic floor muscles, we increase the overall strength and stability of the torso. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=229))
- Lumbar spine Lordosis This is your lower back and where most back problems occur, which is not surprising as it acts as a shock absorber. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=300))
- If your abdominal muscles are weak then it’s possible that they are not doing their job of keeping this part of your back protected. The TVA, which acts like a corset, wrapping itself around our middle (here), if not ‘laced up properly’ can allow the abdominal muscles to fall forwards. So strengthening the abdominal muscles and ‘lacing up the corset’ is vital for a healthy lower back. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=302))
- Thoracic spine Kyphosis This is the middle of your back that can morph into a round-shouldered hunch. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=310))
- Neutral spine when lying down on your back ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=333))
- Neutral spine when standing up ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=342))
- The pelvic floor is a sheet of muscle and connective tissue that spans the area underneath the pelvis, providing support to the pelvic organs including the bladder, intestines and, in women, the womb. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=418))
- Imprinting the spine ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N43SQER&location=442))

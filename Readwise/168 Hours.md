## Highlights
- But in 1990, the management gurus Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad floated a different idea in a Harvard Business Review article. A business could do all right for a while running profitable but unrelated units, they noted, but we were entering a far more competitive, global era. As markets became more efficient, and the labor market became more flexible, top talent would become a scarcer resource than the raw materials or capital companies were used to allocating. There is an opportunity cost in “clarity of strategic intent” when you devote this scarce resource to things that you might be good at, but that other people can do as well or better. It takes energy and focus away from what a company does best. In the globalized era, Hamel and Prahalad wrote, a company would do best by focusing on what they called “core competencies.” ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003NX75PE&location=565))

Role: You are an expert SRE Manager.

> Task: Create a detailed, time-blocked weekly schedule (Monday to Friday, 9:00 - 17:00) for a mid-level DevOps/SRE engineer.
> Goal: The schedule must strategically balance the different "tours of work" to protect deep-work time and minimise context-switching.
> Key Work Types to Include:
>  - Project/Engineering Work: (e.g., writing automation, building new CI/CD pipelines, architectural design). This should be in large, protected blocks.
>  - Operational/Reactive Work: (e.g., responding to alerts, managing tickets, handling developer requests, "toil"). Try to batch this into specific windows.
>  - Team Rituals: (e.g., daily stand-up, sprint planning, retrospectives).
>  - Learning & Improvement: (e.g., personal development, peer review, documenting systems).
> Output Format:
> Present the schedule clearly, day-by-day. Use headings for each day and bullet points for the time blocks (e.g., "10:00 - 12:00: Deep Work (Project Engineering)"). After the schedule, provide a brief justification for why the week is structured that way.

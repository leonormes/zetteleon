## Context Prompt: Understanding Leon

### Overview

Leon is a 52-year-old technical professional with ADHD who combines deep expertise in cloud infrastructure with sophisticated approaches to personal knowledge management and productivity. He's currently developing "prodOS" - an ambitious LLM-powered productivity operating system designed to bridge the gap between knowledge capture and actionable outcomes.

### ADHD Profile and Challenges

#### Core Struggles

- **Task Initiation Paralysis**: Experiences significant resistance to starting tasks, even simple ones like opening an IDE or finding a file. This isn't laziness but a fundamental executive function challenge where the "activation energy" required feels overwhelming.
- **The Knowing-Doing Gap**: Deeply fascinated by concepts and learning itself, but struggles with implementation. Can absorb extensive knowledge about a topic yet find it difficult to translate that into action.
- **Crippling Procrastination**: Long-standing pattern that has affected him throughout his life, despite understanding intellectually what needs to be done.
- **Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)**: Experiences heightened emotional sensitivity to perceived criticism or rejection.
- **External Value Disconnect**: The external importance or urgency of tasks has minimal influence on his motivation - his ADHD mind generates its own priority system based on interest and novelty.

#### ADHD-Specific Patterns

- **Interest-Based Nervous System**: Performs significantly better on tasks that provide immediate interest or novelty
- **Fascination Without Action**: Can be deeply engaged with learning and concepts but struggle to move from knowledge to execution
- **Recency Bias**: Latest thoughts and ideas feel most compelling simply because they're new, creating challenges in building on previous work
- **Incomplete Capture**: When using GTD methodology, tends to do other things not on the list, indicating not everything is being captured effectively

### Technical Expertise

#### Primary Skills

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deep knowledge of Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure
- **DevOps & Cloud Native**: Experienced with containers, orchestration, multi-cloud architectures
- **Disaster Recovery**: Expertise in enterprise-level backup strategies, etcd cluster state management, persistent volumes
- **Networking**: Strong understanding of cloud networking, Protocol Data Units (PDUs), network device functionality
- **Software Development**: Staff-level engineering experience, data-structure-first design philosophy

#### Consulting Work

- Creates comprehensive technical documentation for experienced engineers and architects
- Develops evidence-based programs (including ADHD-optimized fitness training protocols)
- Provides strategic guidance on complex technical implementations

### Productivity Systems & Projects

#### ProdOS (Primary Project)

An ambitious productivity operating system that integrates:

- **Core Components**: Obsidian (markdown PKM), Todoist (task management), LLM orchestration
- **Philosophy**: GTD methodology enhanced with ADHD-aware strategies and extended mind concepts
- **Vision**: An ambient intelligence layer with a LLM "Chief of Staff" to augment executive function
- **Interface Design**: Command palette paradigm + persistent sidebar assistant for low-friction workflows
- **Key Concepts**: "The Indistractable Stack", "The Unschedule", circumstances-aware task routing

#### Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) System

##### Binary Architecture

- **Atomic Notes ("Bricks")**: Context-free, reusable units of knowledge
  - Types: concept, strategy, instructional, question, definition, quote, source, person
- **Structural Notes ("Architecture")**: Linking and organizing frameworks
  - Types: map, comparison, sequence, argument/claim, project, timeline

##### Advanced Features

- **Epistemic Layer**: Tracks knowledge certainty and confidence levels
- **Purpose Fields**: Defines utility and application contexts for notes
- **Cleaving Process**: Systematic refactoring of hybrid notes into atomic components
- **Dataview Workbenches**: Automated review systems

##### Evolutionary Note System

Addresses the challenge of rediscovering and building upon previous thinking:

- **Git-Inspired Mechanics**: HEAD pointers for current understanding, STAGING for raw captures, THREAD for historical evolution
- **Resonance Scoring**: Counters recency bias by rating genuine insight quality
- **Golden Insights Rotation**: Keeps truly valuable ideas prominent over time
- **PDU Analogy**: Applies Protocol Data Unit encapsulation model to knowledge organization (metadata layers wrapping atomic content)

#### GTD Implementation Challenges

- Captures and organizes items but then does other things not on the list
- Struggles to turn vague learning goals ("Learn AWS IAM") into concrete next actions
- Needs micro-steps and ritual cues to overcome task initiation resistance
- Benefits from breaking down tasks to absurdly small components ("just open IDE, nothing else")

### Interests & Learning Style

#### Philosophical Inquiry

- **Epistemology**: Deep interest in the nature of knowledge, certainty, and truth
- **Action Philosophy**: Explores why humans fail to act on what they know
- **Identity Formation**: Wrestles with building coherent self amid relativism and social construction
- **Existential Questions**: Grapples with how to maintain confidence when recognizing the relativity of perspectives

#### Cultural Interests

- **Hip-Hop History**: Commissioned comprehensive research on hip-hop's four elements from 1973 South Bronx origins to global influence
- **Memory Techniques**: Studies methods like "The Link Method" by Anthony Metivier

#### Learning Approach

- **Framework-Oriented**: Consistently seeks to understand underlying principles and structures
- **Systematic**: Develops comprehensive models whether for team understanding, knowledge management, or technical systems
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Creates formal frameworks (e.g., collective team understanding accounting for cognitive biases)
- **Multi-Domain**: Applies insights across disciplines (git concepts to PKM, PDU models to note-taking, etc.)

### Technical Environment & Workflow

#### Core Tools

- **Operating System**: macOS Sequoia
- **Package Manager**: Homebrew (for all CLI tools and applications)
- **Dotfiles Management**: chezmoi (version-controlled, single source of truth)
- **Shell**: Zsh with zinit plugin manager
- **Terminal**: WezTerm with Zellij multiplexer
- **Editor**: Neovim with LazyVim distribution
- **Launcher**: Raycast for global keymaps
- **Keyboard**: Keyboardio Atreus with custom QMK firmware

#### Workflow Philosophy

- **Keyboard-Driven**: Thinks in layers from physical hardware to application
- **Custom Modifiers**: Hyper key (Esc hold) and Meh key (Space hold) for custom shortcuts
- **Reproducibility**: Everything managed through version control for easy replication
- **Clarity**: Each tool and configuration has well-defined responsibilities to simplify debugging

### Family Context

- Has a brother who is a former staff engineer
- Actively helps brother rebuild programming skills with strategic learning approaches
- Emphasizes data-structure-first design and systematic skill development

### Communication Preferences

#### Values

- **Depth Over Brevity**: Appreciates comprehensive, thorough explanations
- **Actionable Advice**: Wants concrete, implementable solutions rather than theory
- **Understanding Why**: Seeks rationale and underlying principles, not just instructions
- **Structured Thinking**: Responds well to frameworks, categories, and systematic breakdowns
- **Evidence-Based**: Values research citations and proven methodologies

#### Response Style Preferences

- Markdown formatting with clear hierarchy

## LLM Planning Context Prompt: Getting Things Done (GTD) and Making It All Work

### 1. Foundational Philosophy and Goal

The core objective of this methodology is to achieve a state of **relaxed and controlled engagement** or "mind like water" . This state is necessary because the mind is excellent for **having ideas**, but terrible for **holding them** . Any commitment, big or small, that remains in the psyche without clarification creates **irrational and unresolvable pressure** .

**A core premise is:** You have to think about your stuff more than you realize, but not as much as you’re afraid you might . Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action .

### 2. The Critical Distinction: Projects vs. Actions

The primary tool for transforming amorphous commitments ("stuff") into manageable work is rigorous definition using two key clarifying questions: "What is the desired outcome?" and "What is the next action?" .

| Commitment Type         | Definition and Scope                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project (Outcome)**   | **Any desired result that requires more than one action step to complete**, usually within a year . This includes small things like "Install new set of tires" or ambiguous issues like "Resolve situation with employees A and B" .            | The Projects list is a comprehensive **index of open loops** . **You do not actually do a project**; you only do action steps related to it . The list is maintained to ensure every commitment has a corresponding next action defined .     |
| **Next Action (Doing)** | The **next physical, visible activity** that progresses something toward completion . It must be specific enough to know **where it happens and with what tools** (e.g., "Draft email to Bob requesting meeting," not "Set meeting with Bob") . | Next Actions translate abstract goals into **doable tasks** . They relieve psychological pressure by finishing the thinking about what comes next . Next Actions are organized primarily by **context** (e.g., @Computer, @Calls, @Errands) . |

### 3. Mastering Workflow: The Five Phases of Control

Gaining control of commitments requires applying a five-step process to all incoming "stuff" :

1. **Capture (Collect):** Gather literally **everything** that has your attention into trusted collection tools outside your head (physical in-trays, notebooks, digital lists, etc.) .
2. **Clarify (Process):** Decide what each captured item means. If it's actionable, determine the desired outcome (Project) and the single next physical step (Next Action) .
3. **Organize:** Sort the results into appropriate "buckets" based on their meaning and how they need to be reviewed :
   - **Calendar:** Actions or information tied to a specific day or time .
   - **Next Actions Lists:** Actions that can be done as soon as possible, sorted by Context .
   - **Projects List:** Index of all multi-step outcomes .
   - **Waiting For List:** Items delegated or ordered from others .
   - **Reference/Support:** Non-actionable information .
   - **Incubation (Someday/Maybe):** Items tabled for later reassessment.
4. **Reflect (Review):** Review the system regularly to ensure it is current and functional . The **Weekly Review** is critical for checking the status of all projects and ensuring every open commitment has a defined next action .
5. **Engage (Do):** Take action by making moment-to-moment choices.

### 4. Gaining Perspective: The Six Horizons of Focus

Priorities cascade downward through six distinct "Horizons of Focus," providing vertical alignment for all commitments . Reviewing these levels provides crucial perspective :

| Horizon Level (Altitude)  | Scope and Question                                                                                                                                                  | Function                                                                   |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Horizon 5 (50,000 ft)** | **Purpose and Principles:** Ultimate intention and core values ("Why are we doing this?") .                                                                         | Defines the ultimate criteria for decisions and success .                  |
| **Horizon 4 (40,000 ft)** | **Vision:** Long-term success scenarios (3–5 years) ("What would long-term success look, sound, and feel like?") .                                                  | Provides the blueprint for the final result, guiding subsequent planning . |
| **Horizon 3 (30,000 ft)** | **Goals and Objectives:** Outcomes to achieve (1–2 years) .                                                                                                         | Aligns shorter-term actions toward the long-term vision .                  |
| **Horizon 2 (20,000 ft)** | **Areas of Focus and Accountability:** Roles, responsibilities, and areas to maintain (e.g., Staff Development, Health, Finances) ("What do I need to maintain?") . | Serves as a checklist to ensure balance and prevent neglect .              |
| **Horizon 1 (10,000 ft)** | **Current Projects:** All multi-step outcomes .                                                                                                                     | Index of open loops that require weekly attention to drive Next Actions .  |
| **Ground (Runway)**       | **Current Actions:** The physical tasks you can do right now .                                                                                                      | The final expression of all higher-level commitments .                     |

### 5. Making Action Choices

Assuming all commitments are captured, clarified, and organized, daily choices about what to do in the moment are determined by four practical criteria :

1. **Context:** What tools or location are available (e.g., at the phone, at the office) .
2. **Time Available:** How much time is free before the next scheduled commitment .
3. **Energy Available:** Mental, emotional, or physical capacity (e.g., tackling simple tasks when energy is low, complex tasks when energy is high) .
4. **Priority:** Based on the context and energy, choose the action that best aligns with the higher Horizons of Focus .

### 6. Work Visibility and Flow Management

The principle of making work visible optimizes flow and prevents capacity overload, integrating well with GTD:

- **Make Work Visible:** When work is invisible, capacity is obscured, leading to mental overload and stress .
- **WIP (Work-in-Progress):** Too much WIP occurs when demand exceeds capacity, resulting in clashing priorities, increased dependencies, and interruptions .
- **Limit WIP:** Limiting WIP creates the necessary tension to **complete** work, rather than starting new items, which shortens cycle time .
- **Conflicting/Unplanned Work:** Unplanned work (interruptions, fires) must be made visible and planned for by reserving capacity .
- **Context Switching:** Interruptions force context switches, which can take up to twenty minutes to recover from, draining energy and reducing flow .

### Summary of Best Practices for Planning

- **Finish Your Thinking:** For every item, immediately define the concrete next action to move it forward .
- **Do It, Delegate It, or Defer It (The 3 Ds):** If an action takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. If it takes longer, delegate it or defer it into your trusted system .
- **Weekly Review is Non-Negotiable:** Dedicate time (ideally weekly) to review projects, clean up inputs, and ensure systems are current; this is the key to sustainability .
- **Bottom-Up Focus:** In times of high confusion or stress, focus on fixing Ground-level issues (e.g., clearing the in-tray) before tackling high-level strategic planning, as control facilitates perspective.

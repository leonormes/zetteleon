Alphanumeric IDs establish relationships between ideas by giving each main note a **permanent identity** that can be referenced regardless of any changes made to the note's content. This mechanism ensures that every note becomes an **element in the network of references and back-references** within the system, from which it gains its utility.

In the larger context of Alphanumeric IDs (*Folgezettel*):

1.  **Establishing a Sequential Train of Thought:**
    -   When you create a new note that is directly relevant or refers to an existing idea, you add it directly behind the previous note. This creates a **longer chain of notes**.
    -   If the existing note has a number (e.g., 22), the new note can be 23. If 23 already exists, the new note can be **22a**.
    -   By alternating numbers and letters (e.g., 22, 22a, 22a1), the system allows the note sequences to **branch out into an infinite number of sequences and subsequences**. This allows the note maker to have an ongoing "conversation" with themselves, with each new statement building on previous ones.
    -   These note sequences form the **backbone of text development**. A visibly **long alphanumeric ID indicates a train of thought that has been added to over time**.

2.  **Defining the Relationship's Nature:**
    -   The ID system shows that a **relationship exists** between notes, but it does **not** indicate the **semantic quality or meaning** of that relationship.
    -   The relationship is **subjective** and depends entirely on the note maker's thinking at the moment of creation. For example, a note on skateboarding could be linked to a note on diet, depending on the context the note maker established.
    -   This ensures that the *Folgezettel* system is **not an outline**, and ideas are imported in the order they emerge, rather than a predetermined logical order.

3.  **Cross-Context Connections:**
    -   Beyond placing notes sequentially behind one another, you can establish relationships using **plain note-to-note links**. This allows an idea to be added to **different contexts** across the slip-box.
    -   This method forces the user to **connect newly imported ideas** (a form of "eufriction") and think about how the new capture relates to what is already stored.

Would you like to explore how the structure established by these IDs (which is emergent and bottom-up) differs from a traditional hierarchical approach like a standard outline?

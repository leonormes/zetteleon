*The Goal: To capture the raw, embodied energy of a thought without judgment.*

This is the initial, messy, and essential act of getting a thought out of your head and onto the page. We now add physical gesture to Goldberg's timed practice to further unlock nascent ideas.

**The Method: Embodied Writing Practice**

1. **Set a Timer**: Start with 10 minutes.
2. **Pick a Topic**: Use the thought or question that emerged during your preparation in Stage 0.
3. **Write with Momentum & Gesture**: Follow Goldberg's rules (**keep your hand moving, don't cross out, lose control, go for the jugular**). As you write, allow yourself to **gesture**. Annie Murphy Paul explains that our "newest and most advanced ideas" often show up in our hands before our words. Gesturing helps give shape to an incipient notion and can "offload" cognitive burden, freeing up mental resources.

> **Outcome**: A raw, unedited block of text that contains the "first thoughts" and embodied energy of your idea. It will be even richer for having engaged your body in the process.

*(This stage remains the same—a raw, energetic capture.)*

*The Goal: To capture the raw energy of a thought without judgment.*

This is the initial, messy, and essential act of getting a thought out of your head and onto the page. It overcomes the inertia and "dullness" of translating profound feelings into linear text.

**The Method: Timed Writing Practice**

1. **Set a Timer**: Start with 10 minutes.
2. **Pick a Topic**: Use the thought, question, or feeling that sparked your interest.
3. **Write with Momentum**: For the entire duration, you must follow these rules:
   - **Keep your hand moving**: Don't pause to think or reread. Outrun the censor.
   - **Don't cross out**: Leave everything, even mistakes. This is not editing.
   - **Lose control**: Don't worry about logic, spelling, or grammar. Follow the thought wherever it leads.
   - **Go for the jugular**: If a vulnerable or scary idea emerges, dive into it. That's where the energy is.

> **Outcome**: A raw, unedited block of text that contains the "first thoughts" and emotional energy of your idea. It will be messy, and that is the point.

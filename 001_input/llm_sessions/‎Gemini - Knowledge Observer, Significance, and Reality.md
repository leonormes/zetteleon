Help me think about this idea. I often wonder about how much of what we think of as human knowledge and intelligence is only significant to us. We think knowledge and understanding the universe is significant. Is maths invented or discovered. My thought this evening is this. The nature of our senses and the fact we are discrete entities and the fact out brains seek patterns to predict our environment sets up the conditions that make knowledge significant. As observers we create the know/ don't know distinction. Patterns on nature are significant because of our very specific limitations. By nature I mean our perceived laws of physics.

You've hit on a core question in philosophy and cognitive science. The idea that knowledge and its significance are products of our specific nature as observers is a powerful one. Our brains did not evolve to understand the universe in its totality, but to create useful, predictive models of our immediate environment for survival.

## The Observer Effect on Reality

Your thought that "As observers we create the know/ don't know distinction" is fundamental. Without a conscious observer, the universe simply *is*. There is no concept of "pattern," "law," or "knowledge." These are categories created by a mind trying to process information.

A concept from biology that aligns with your thinking is **Umwelt**, a term popularised by the biologist Jakob von Uexküll. It describes the unique perceptual world of an organism. A bat's Umwelt is a world of echoes and textures, a bee's is a world of ultraviolet patterns on flowers, and ours is a world of specific colours and sounds. Our knowledge of physics is built entirely from within our human Umwelt. It's a description of the patterns that are perceptible and meaningful to a creature with our specific sensory and cognitive toolkit.

## Is Maths Invented or Discovered

This classic debate fits perfectly into your framework.

- **Discovered (Platonism):** This view holds that mathematical truths are universal and exist independently of us. The number '3' and the properties of a triangle are real entities that we simply uncover. In this view, the patterns are fundamental to the universe, and we are just fortunate enough to have a brain capable of recognising them.
- **Invented (Formalism/Intuitionism):** This view argues that mathematics is a sophisticated language or game we created. It's a set of consistent rules and symbols that our pattern-seeking brains have constructed to describe the world. This aligns closely with your idea: maths is significant *to us* because it's the ultimate tool for modelling the patterns our brains are wired to find. The reason it describes the universe so well is that it was built for that very purpose, based on our observations.

The physicist Eugene Wigner called the remarkable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences a "miracle." Your line of thinking provides a potential explanation: it's not a miracle, but a consequence of maths being a system developed by the human brain to model the very reality it perceives.

## Physics as a Model for Survival

You suggest that the laws of physics are significant "because of our very specific limitations." This is a key insight. Our physical laws are not the universe itself; they are **models** of the universe. They are incredibly successful predictive frameworks, but they are still products of the human mind.

Consider **Newtonian mechanics**. It works perfectly for the scales we interact with daily (throwing a ball, building a bridge). It allowed us to predict and control our environment with incredible success. However, we later found its limitations at the very large (relativity) and very small (quantum mechanics) scales.

This doesn't make Newton wrong; it just shows that his "knowledge" was a model relevant to a specific slice of reality—the slice most important to human survival and experience. We seek patterns and codify them into "laws" because this process turns a chaotic and dangerous unknown into a predictable, and therefore safer, known. The significance is tied directly to utility and survival.

In essence, knowledge is less of a static "thing" to be collected and more of a dynamic, ongoing relationship between our limited, evolved consciousness and the vast universe it finds itself in.

But the patterns we describe with maths exist because we say they do. The fact of seveness is true because it is significant to a human mind. Without that, it is meaningless. What is the argument for patterns to have any meaning without a enclosed set of complex chemical reactions acting as an observer sensing things outside of themselves

The argument for patterns having meaning without an observer is that the universe possesses an objective, inherent **structure**. From this viewpoint, our mathematics and concepts like "sevenness" are not the patterns themselves, but are the **language** we have discovered to describe these pre-existing regularities.

The core of the argument rests on distinguishing the **pattern** from our **perception** of it.

## Physical Structure Precedes Observation

The universe is not a random, chaotic void; it has a definite organisation governed by physical laws. This organisation creates real, tangible patterns that existed long before any complex chemical reactions evolved to observe them.

- **Crystallisation:** When water freezes, its molecules arrange themselves into a hexagonal lattice due to hydrogen bonds. This is why every snowflake has a six-fold symmetry. This pattern is a direct consequence of the physics of water molecules. It happened for billions of years on Earth and happens on other planets without any minds to appreciate it. The pattern is physically real.
- **Gravity and Orbits:** Gravity causes matter to clump together into spheres (stars, planets) and causes these bodies to follow predictable elliptical orbits. The orbits of the planets in our solar system are a stable, repeating pattern that is independent of our awareness of them.
- **Chemistry:** Carbon atoms will reliably bond with four other atoms in a tetrahedral shape, a pattern which allows for the formation of complex structures like diamonds or life itself. This isn't a human convention; it's a fundamental property of the carbon atom.

In this view, the "fact of sevenness" isn't just in our minds. A constellation like the Pleiades contains a specific number of stars that are gravitationally associated. The physical arrangement of those seven stars is an objective fact. Our invention is the abstract concept and the word "seven" to label that physical reality. The grouping exists whether we count it or not.

## The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics

A powerful argument for the independent existence of mathematical patterns is their predictive power. If maths were purely a human invention, just a game we made up, it would be a staggering coincidence that it so accurately predicts the behaviour of the universe.

For example, when Paul Dirac was formulating his equations for the electron in 1928, the mathematics produced two solutions. One described the electron, but the other described a particle with the same mass but a positive charge, which had never been seen. Rather than dismissing it as a mathematical quirk, he predicted the existence of this new particle: the positron, or **antimatter**. It was discovered experimentally four years later.

This suggests that mathematics is not just describing what we already see; it is revealing an underlying structure of reality that we haven't yet observed. The pattern, encoded in the maths, was there waiting to be found.

## The Map is Not the Territory

Ultimately, the argument is a philosophical one that separates the world from our description of it.

Think of a coastline. It has a complex, jagged shape that has existed for millennia. We can invent cartography and geometry to create a **map** of that coastline. The map is our invention—a human construct with symbols and lines. But the **coastline itself** is real and objective.

Similarly, the universe has a real, underlying mathematical structure. Our equations and theorems are the map we have created to navigate it. We invent the language and the symbols, but we **discover** the territory they describe. The meaning or significance is what we, as observers, bring to the table. But the structure, the pattern, the "coastline of reality," is already there.

## What is the Difference between Mass and Weight

Mass is the amount of matter an object contains, measured in kilograms (kg) and remains constant regardless of location, while weight is the force exerted on that mass by gravity, measured in newtons (N), and changes depending on the gravitational field strength[^1_1][^1_2][^1_5][^1_7].

### Mass

- Represents the amount of matter in an object[^1_5][^1_7].
- Measured in kilograms (kg) in the SI system[^1_1][^1_5][^1_7].
- Remains unchanged whether the object is on Earth, the Moon, or in space[^1_5][^1_7].
- Scalar quantity (has magnitude only, no direction)[^1_1][^1_7].

### Weight

- Is the force exerted on mass by gravity[^1_1][^1_5][^1_7].
- Changes based on the gravitational pull at the object's location (different on Earth, Moon, Mars, etc.)[^1_2][^1_5][^1_7].
- Measured in newtons (N) in the SI system[^1_1][^1_5][^1_7].
- Vector quantity (has both magnitude and direction—always directed towards the center of mass attracting the object)[^1_1][^1_7].
- Calculated by the formula: \$ W = m \times g \$ (where \$ W \$ is weight in newtons, \$ m \$ is mass in kilograms, and \$ g \$ is gravitational acceleration, approximately \$ 9.81 \, m/s^2 \$ on Earth)[^1_1][^1_5][^1_7].

### Quick Comparison Table

| Property | Mass | Weight |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Definition | Amount of matter | Force of gravity on mass |
| SI Unit | Kilogram (kg)[^1_1] | Newton (N)[^1_1] |
| Changes with location? | No[^1_7] | Yes[^1_2][^1_5][^1_7] |
| Type | Scalar[^1_1][^1_7] | Vector[^1_1][^1_7] |
| Formula | — | \$ W = m \times g \$[^1_1][^1_7] |
| Example Value | 1 kg (constant anywhere) | 9.81 N on Earth, less on Moon |

- Mass tells you “how much stuff” is there; weight tells you “how strongly gravity pulls on that stuff”[^1_5][^1_1].
- On Earth, 1 kg of mass weighs about 9.81 N; on the Moon, it would weigh less, though the mass is unchanged[^1_2][^1_5].

For practical purposes, especially outside of science, mass and weight are often used interchangeably, but they have important differences—particularly in physics and engineering contexts[^1_1][^1_2][^1_5].

## So when We Do Weight Lifting why Do We Measure the Mass of the Things We Lift and not the Newtons? We Are Exerting Effort against Gravity not Mass

Weightlifting measures the mass of objects (in kilograms or pounds) instead of their weight in newtons because gravitational acceleration on Earth is nearly constant everywhere people train, making mass a convenient and consistent proxy for effort[^2_5][^2_6].

### Why Mass is Used in Gyms

- The gravitational field strength ($g$) on Earth's surface barely varies, so the weight (force you feel) of a 20 kg object is always about 196 N ($W = m \times g$, with $g \approx 9.81~\text{m/s}^2$), no matter where you are[^2_6][^2_5].
- It’s far simpler for equipment manufacturers and lifters to label and think about “how many kilos are loaded” rather than recalculating the force (in newtons) each time[^2_5].
- Most scales and gym weights are calibrated and labeled in mass units (kg/lb), matching everyday expectations and making comparison between lifters and gyms much easier[^2_5].

### Practical Reasoning

- Since almost everyone trains at or near sea level, the gravitational acceleration is universally agreed as \$ \approx 9.81~m/s^2 \$, so 1 kg always “feels” the same force everywhere on Earth[^2_6][^2_5].
- If you trained on the Moon, where gravity is about 1/6 of Earth’s, you’d notice the same 20 kg mass feels much lighter—its weight (force due to gravity) is lower. The gym would still label it “20 kg” rather than “33 N”[^2_5].
- In fields where force matters (like climbing equipment or engineering), ratings use newtons or kilonewtons—because those forces change a lot with environment and scenario[^2_5].

### Summary Table

| In the Gym | In Physics |
| :-- | :-- |
| Dumbbell: Labeled 10 kg (mass) | Actual weight is about 98 N (on Earth)[^2_6] |
| Everyone uses kg for convenience | Physicists convert mass to force with $g$[^2_6] |
| Effort doesn't change with altitude (on Earth) | Force of gravity can change on other planets[^2_5] |

Measuring in mass lets everyone use standard, universal numbers while knowing the force is consistent on Earth. The effort you exert is against gravity acting on that mass, but the “mass” is just easier to handle on every gym floor[^2_6][^2_5].

## But Technically it is Incorrect to Say "it Weighs 20kg"

Yes, it is technically incorrect in scientific terms to say "it weighs 20kg"—weight should be expressed in newtons (N), while kilograms (kg) measure mass[^3_2][^3_1][^3_5][^3_4].

### Scientific Vs Everyday Language

- **Scientifically**, weight is a force and always expressed in newtons: saying "it weighs 20 kg" actually means "its mass is 20 kg"; the true weight on Earth is $20 \times 9.81 = 196.2$ N[^3_2][^3_5].
- **In everyday language**, especially in shops and gyms, "weight" is commonly used as a synonym for mass, because for most practical purposes on Earth's surface, the distinction doesn’t affect the user's needs[^3_7][^3_2][^3_1].

### Why the Confusion Persists

- Scales are usually calibrated to Earth's gravity, so when they display "20 kg," they’re actually showing the mass of the object but using the term "weight" as a shorthand[^3_7][^3_2].
- Only in scientific, engineering, or space contexts does the difference truly matter because gravity varies in different environments[^3_2][^3_5].

So, while technically imprecise, using "kg" for weight is so ingrained in common usage that it’s rarely corrected outside of academic or professional physics discussions[^3_2][^3_7][^3_1][^3_4].

## How is Mass Measured? in Everyday Life We Can Measure Something's Weight and Translate that to Mass. but how is the Base Unit of Mass Determined

Mass is measured using balances, which compare an object's mass to a known standard, and in everyday life, scales use local gravity to give a mass reading by measuring weight and converting it. The base unit of mass—the kilogram (kg)—is defined not by any physical object, but by a fundamental constant of nature: the Planck constant ($h$), set exactly at $6.62607015 \times 10^{-34}$ joule-seconds[^4_2][^4_1][^4_4].

### How Mass is Measured

- **Everyday:** Scales (for people, food, etc.) measure force (weight) and use Earth's gravity to display the equivalent mass in kilograms or pounds, assuming gravity is standard[^4_1].
- **Laboratory/Scientific:** High-precision laboratory measurements use devices like the Kibble balance (formerly called the watt balance) to directly relate mechanical power and electromagnetic power, making it possible to equate a mass to the value of Planck's constant, meter, and second[^4_1][^4_9].

### Defining the Kilogram

- The kilogram's definition was originally based on a physical prototype but, since 2019, is derived from the Planck constant, which is a universal invariant in quantum physics[^4_2][^4_1].
- The current definition: "The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant, $h$, to be $6.62607015 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s, where the meter and second are defined in terms of the speed of light and the caesium atomic clock, respectively"[^4_2][^4_1].
- This change ensures perfect reproducibility anywhere in the universe, linking mass to constants of nature rather than an artifact[^4_1][^4_2][^4_9].

In summary, while everyday measurements rely on scales translating weight to mass, the international standard for mass—the kilogram—is now fundamentally anchored to universal constants, not dependent on a physical object or location[^4_1][^4_2][^4_9].

For a 52-year-old male aiming for functional, well-rounded physical strength after significant weight loss, focus on fundamental movement groups that support daily activity, injury prevention, and sustainable fitness. Here are the key movement patterns and practical exercises that build strength across all major muscle groups, with an emphasis on core, mobility, and balance[1][2][3][4][5][6][7].

***

### Foundational Movement Groups

- Squat & Lunge (lower body strength, balance, joint health)
- Hinge (hip and posterior chain strength)
- Push (upper body, chest, shoulders, triceps)
- Pull (upper body, back, biceps)
- Carry (core, grip, functional endurance)
- Rotate & Anti-Rotate (core, obliques, spinal stability)
- Balance & Stability (proprioception, fall prevention)
- Mobility [joint range, flexibility, muscle function](2)[3][4][6]

***

### Essential Functional Exercises

#### Squat Movements

- **Bodyweight Squat / Sit-to-Stand:** From a chair or standing, squat down and up for glute, quad, and hamstring activation[3][6][7].
- **Step-Ups:** Step onto a sturdy platform, alternating legs to build unilateral strength and balance[3][8][6].
- **Multi-Directional Lunge:** Forward, backward, and side lunges for hip and core stability[5].

#### Hinge Patterns

- **Hip Hinge / Romanian Deadlift:** Bend at the hips, keeping the spine neutral and using glutes and hamstrings[2][9].
- **Glute Bridge:** Lying back, lift hips while tightening glutes—excellent for low back and hip strength[3][6].

#### Push Patterns

- **Elevated or Wall Push-Ups:** Hands on a wall or bench to protect shoulders, press away for chest and arms[1][3][8][7].
- **Chest Press:** Dumbbell or resistance band chest press for upper body strength[10].

#### Pull Patterns

- **Assisted Pull-Ups or Rows:** Use bands or machines; pulling toward the torso builds back and biceps[1].
- **Bar Hanging:** For grip and shoulder strength, simply hang from a bar as long as comfortable[2].

#### Carry Movements

- **Farmer’s Carry:** Walk with weights by your sides, activating grip, core, shoulders, and legs[3][5].

#### Rotation & Anti-Rotation

- **Dead Bug:** On back, move opposite arm and leg, holding core steady—improves deep core stability[3].
- **Shoulder “Pass Throughs”:** Use a stick for dynamic shoulder mobility and flexibility[2].

#### Balance & Stability

- **Single-Leg Balance:** Stand on one leg [progress by closing eyes or adding movement](3).
- **Heel Toe Walks:** Walk in a line, heel to toe for balance and proprioception[2].

#### Additional Functional Exercises

- **Calf Raises:** Stand and lift onto tiptoes; great for lower leg strength and balance[3][7].
- **Bicep Curls:** Light weights or resistance bands for arm strength and grip[8].
- **Plank:** Hold a straight line on elbows and toes for core and shoulder stability[11].

***

### Sample Weekly Structure

- Squat pattern: 2x/week (squats, step-ups or lunges)
- Hinge pattern: 2x/week (bridges, deadlifts)
- Push pattern: 2x/week (push-ups, presses)
- Pull pattern: 2x/week (rows, hangs)
- Carry: 1x/week (farmer’s carry)
- Core: 2x/week (dead bug, planks)
- Balance/mobility: integrated daily as warm-up or finishers

***

### Action Steps

1. Pick 1-2 exercises from each movement group and perform 2-3 sets of 8-15 reps[1][3][6][7].
2. Progress by increasing reps, resistance, or complexity [e.g., squats to step-ups; wall push-ups to floor](1)[3].
3. Include mobility and balance drills in warm-up or cool-down to reinforce healthy movement[2][3].
4. Emphasize slow, controlled form and rest between sets for injury prevention[1][3].
5. Rotate exercises every few weeks for variety and adaptability[4][6].

***

This approach will help you develop functional strength, support daily activity demands, reduce injury risk, and maintain an athletic, well-balanced physique at any age[1][3][6][7].

Of course. This is an excellent profile with huge potential for transformation. Your recent weight loss is a phenomenal achievement, and we will now build a strong, resilient, and capable body on that foundation.

Here is your personalised, modular weekly training plan, designed for your goals, age, and ADHD-friendly preferences.

The Philosophy: "Movement Patterns, Not Muscles"

We will train your body based on how it's designed to move, not just by isolating muscles. This builds the functional, athletic physique you're after. The six key movement patterns are:

1. Hinge (Posterior Chain - Glutes, Hamstrings, Lower Back)
   · Beginner: Banded Good Mornings, Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs)
   · Intermediate: Barbell RDLs, Kettlebell Swings
   · Why: Critical for power, back health, and building a strong posterior.
2. Squat (Quad Dominant - Quads, Glutes)
   · Beginner: Bodyweight Squats, Goblet Squats
   · Intermediate: Barbell Back Squat, Barbell Front Squat
   · Why: The cornerstone of lower body strength and athleticism.
3. Lunge (Unilateral Lower Body - Stability, Glutes, Quads)
   · Beginner: Bodyweight Reverse Lunges, Static Lunges
   · Intermediate: Walking Lunges, Bulgarian Split Squats
   · Why: Corrects imbalances, builds rock-solid stability.
4. Push (Upper Body - Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)
   · Vertical Push: Dumbbell Shoulder Press, Pike Push-ups
   · Horizontal Push: Push-ups, Dumbbell Bench Press
   · Why: For upper body strength and a balanced torso.
5. Pull (Upper Body - Back, Biceps)
   · Vertical Pull: Lat Pulldowns, Assisted Pull-ups
   · Horizontal Pull: Banded Rows, Bent-Over Dumbbell Rows
   · Why: Essential for posture, a V-taper, and countering all the pushing we do in life.
6. Carry (Core, Grip, Posture)
   · Beginner: Farmer's Walk (dumbbells/kettlebells), Suitcase Carry (one heavy weight)
   · Intermediate: Overhead Carry, Rack Carry
   · Why: The ultimate functional exercise. Builds a "coat of armour" around your core.

Your Modular Weekly Training Plan

This is not a rigid schedule. It's a "menu" of sessions you can mix and match. Aim for 4 sessions per week, ensuring you hit all movement patterns.

· Session A: Full Body Strength

  · Warm-Up (5 mins): Dynamic stretches – Leg swings, arm circles, cat-cow, bird-dog.

  · Workout (25-35 mins):

1. Squat: 3 sets of 6-8 reps (e.g., Goblet Squat)
2. Horizontal Pull: 3 sets of 8-10 reps (e.g., Bent-Over Dumbbell Row)
3. Hinge: 3 sets of 8-10 reps (e.g., Dumbbell RDL)
4. Vertical Push: 3 sets of 8-10 reps (e.g., Dumbbell Shoulder Press)
5. Carry: 3 sets of 30-40m walks (e.g., Farmer's Walk)

Key Recovery & Consistency Strategies

1. Sleep is Non-Negotiable: Aim for 7-8 hours. This is when your body repairs muscle and regulates hormones crucial for fat loss and recovery.
2. ADHD-Friendly Focus & Motivation:
   · Gamify It: Use a simple app to tick off workouts. A visual chain of success is powerful.
   · The "5-Minute Rule": Commit to just 5 minutes of the warm-up. Often, starting is the only hurdle.
   · Embrace Variety: This modular plan is designed so you don't get bored. Switch the exercises within the movement patterns every 4-6 weeks.
   · Rapid Feedback: Track something simple like the weight you use on your Goblet Squat or how many push-ups you can do in one set. Seeing this number go up is instant, powerful feedback.
   · Pairing: Link your workout with a podcast or a specific playlist you only listen to at the gym.
3. Listen to Your 52-Year-Old Body: You have a great baseline, but recovery is key. If you feel overly fatigued or achy, swap a strength day for a LISS walk or a full rest day. You're playing the long game.

Nutrition for Muscle Growth & Fat Loss Maintenance

After rapid weight loss with Mounjaro, the goal is now body recomposition – losing the last bit of fat while building new muscle.

1. Protein Priority: This is your #1 lever. Aim for ~140-160g of protein per day.
   · Rationale: Preserves the muscle you have and provides the building blocks for new growth. It's also highly satiating.
   · How: A protein source (chicken, fish, lean beef, eggs, Greek yoghurt, protein powder) with every meal.
2. Manage Energy Intake: You don't need a massive calorie surplus to build muscle. A slight deficit or maintenance will work perfectly now.
   · Start with ~2,200-2,400 calories per day. Monitor your weight and strength for 2-3 weeks. If weight is stable and strength is going up, you're in the perfect zone.
3. Smart Carbohydrates: Use carbs to fuel your workouts, not your sofa time.
   · Focus on carbs around your training (e.g., a banana before, some rice/potatoes with your post-workout meal). On rest days, you can lower carb intake slightly and increase healthy fats.
4. Hydration: Drink 2-3 litres of water daily. Muscle function and recovery depend on it.
5. Fibre & Micronutrients: Load up on vegetables with your meals. They provide volume, fibre for satiety, and essential vitamins/minerals for overall health and recovery.

You have done the hard part by losing the weight. Now we get to the fun part: building the strength and physique that matches your new-found energy and motivation. Consistency over perfection is the mantra.

Let's get to work.

Here is a personalised, modular training programme designed to build functional strength and a balanced, athletic physique, specifically tailored to your goals and psychological profile.

Guiding Principles

- Rebuild First: After rapid weight loss (especially with GLP-1 agonists), muscle loss (sarcopenia) can be significant. Our number one priority is resistance training to rebuild this metabolically active tissue.
- ADHD-Friendly Workflow: This programme is built on variety, frequency, and "small wins." Sessions are short (\approx 30-45 minutes) but frequent, providing consistent feedback and preventing boredom.
- Movement > Muscles: We will train movements (Push, Pull, Hinge, Squat, Lunge, Carry), not just body parts. This builds functional strength that translates to real life and creates a balanced physique.

1. The Weekly Modular Plan
This is a 4-day-per-week, Full-Body A/B Split. This structure gives you frequency and variety, allowing you to hit each movement pattern twice per week without any single session becoming a long, tedious slog.

- Monday: Session A
- Tuesday: Session B
- Wednesday: Active Recovery (e.g., 30-min walk, mobility)
- Thursday: Session A (use different exercise variations)
- Friday: Session B (use different exercise variations)
- Saturday: Cardio (LISS or HIIT)
- Sunday: Full Rest

2. Session Structure: The "A" and "B" Workouts
Aim for 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions for each exercise. This range is optimal for hypertrophy (muscle growth).
Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets. Use a timer to stay on track.
Session A: Squat & Push Focus

| Movement | Exercise Example | Sets x Reps | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Warm-up | (See section 4) | 5-10 mins | Prepares joints and muscles; activates CNS. |
| 1. Squat | Goblet Squat | 3 x 8-12 | The foundational pattern. Teaches core bracing and leg drive. |
| 2. Horizontal Push | Dumbbell Bench Press | 3 x 8-12 | Builds chest, shoulders, and triceps. Dumbbells allow for natural shoulder movement. |
| 3. Horizontal Pull | Single-Arm Dumbbell Row | 3 x 8-12 (per side) | Builds back thickness and counters all pushing. Unilateral (one-sided) work fixes imbalances. |
| 4. Core | Plank | 3 x 45-60 sec | Develops anterior core stability (anti-extension). |
| Cool-down | (See section 4) | 5 mins | Begins the recovery process. |

Session B: Hinge & Pull Focus

| Movement | Exercise Example | Sets x Reps | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Warm-up | (See section 4) | 5-10 mins | Prepares joints and muscles; activates CNS. |
| 1. Hinge | Dumbbell RDL | 3 x 10-15 | Builds the entire "posterior chain" (hamstrings, glutes, back). Crucial for power and posture. |
| 2. Vertical Pull | Lat Pulldown (Gym) or Banded Pull-down | 3 x 8-12 | Builds back width (the "V-taper") and supports shoulder health. |
| 3. Lunge | Reverse Lunge | 3 x 8-10 (per side) | Unilateral leg strength. Builds glutes and quads, and improves balance. |
| 4. Carry | Farmer's Carry | 3 x 30m | The ultimate functional exercise. Builds grip, traps, core, and mental toughness. |
| Cool-down | (See section 4) | 5 mins | Begins the recovery process. |

3. The Movement Pattern "Menu"
This is how you ensure variety. For each session, simply swap in an alternative exercise from the same category.

| Pattern | Beginner Option (Master these first) | Intermediate Option (Progress to these) |
|---|---|---|
| Squat | Bodyweight Squat (to a box), Goblet Squat (light) | Dumbbell Front Squat, Barbell Back Squat (requires form check) |
| Hinge | Bodyweight Hip Hinge (wall tap), Banded Good Morning | Dumbbell RDL, Kettlebell Swing, Conventional Deadlift (requires coaching) |
| Horizontal Push | Incline Push-up, Banded Chest Press | Floor Push-up, Dumbbell Bench Press, Barbell Bench Press |
| Horizontal Pull | Banded Row (seated/standing), Inverted Row (under table) | Single-Arm Dumbbell Row, Cable Row (gym), Pendlay Row |
| Vertical Push | Banded Overhead Press, Seated Dumbbell Press (light) | Standing Dumbbell Press, Barbell Overhead Press |
| Vertical Pull | Banded Pull-down, Band-assisted Pull-up | Lat Pulldown (gym), Pull-up / Chin-up (use negatives) |
| Lunge | Bodyweight Split Squat, Bodyweight Reverse Lunge | Dumbbell Reverse Lunge, Bulgarian Split Squat |
| Core/Carry | Plank, Dead Bug, Bird-dog | Farmer's Carry, Suitcase Carry, Plank w/ row |

4. Warm-up, Cool-down & Recovery
Do not skip these. They are critical for injury prevention and performance.
Dynamic Warm-up (5-10 mins)
Perform this before every single workout.

- Pulse Raiser (3 mins): Light skipping, jogging on the spot, or jumping jacks.
- Mobility Drills (5 mins):
  - Cat-Cow: 10 reps (for spinal mobility)
  - World's Greatest Stretch: 5 reps per side (opens hips, thoracic spine)
  - Leg Swings: 15 reps (front-to-back and side-to-side)
  - Band Pull-Aparts: 20 reps (activates upper back and shoulders)
  - Bodyweight Squats: 15 reps (primes the squat pattern)
Cool-down (5 mins)
Perform this immediately after your last set.
- Heart Rate Reduction (2 mins): Slow, deliberate walking. Focus on deep, nasal breathing.
- Static Stretches (Hold 30s each):
  - Chest Stretch (doorway or band)
  - Lat Stretch (hang from bar or pull-down machine)
  - Hamstring Stretch (forward fold)
  - Quad Stretch (standing)
Key Recovery Strategies
- Sleep: This is when you repair and grow. It is non-negotiable. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep.
- Hydration: Muscle is \approx 75\% water. Dehydration crushes performance. Aim for 2.5 - 3 litres of water per day, plus more on training days.
- Active Recovery: On your "off" days, move. A 30-minute brisk walk is perfect. It pumps blood to sore muscles (DOMS) and aids repair without causing more stress.

5. Consistency & ADHD-Friendly Focus

- Log Everything: This is your "rapid feedback". Use a notebook or app. Write down Exercise, Weight, Sets x Reps. Seeing Goblet Squat 16kg 3x8 become Goblet Squat 20kg 3x10 two weeks later is a massive dopamine hit.
- Reduce Friction: Lay out your gym clothes, bands, and water bottle the night before. The fewer steps between "I should work out" and "I am working out," the better.
- The 5-Minute Rule: On low-motivation days, just commit to the 5-minute warm-up. If you still want to stop after 5 minutes, you can. 9 times out of 10, you'll continue and complete the session.
- Use a Timer: Use your phone's timer for rest periods. It keeps the session moving, maintains focus, and prevents you from drifting off.
- "Flow" your Workout: Group exercises that use the same equipment (e.g., do your Dumbbell Press and Dumbbell Rows in the same spot) to minimise setup time and maintain momentum.

6. Nutrition Strategy: Rebuild & Re-comp
Your recent weight loss is fantastic, but now we must shift focus from just loss to rebuilding. You are in a prime position for "body recomposition" (losing fat and gaining muscle simultaneously).
Your Number One Priority: Protein.

- Why: It is the building block for the muscle you want to grow. It is also highly satiating (keeps you full) and has the highest thermic effect of food (burns calories to digest).
- Target: Aim for 1.6 - 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight.
  - At 91kg, this is 145g - 182g of protein per day.
- How: Make it the centrepiece of every meal.
  - Breakfast: Greek yoghurt, eggs, or a protein shake.
  - Lunch: Large chicken breast or salmon fillet with salad/vegetables.
  - Dinner: Lean mince, fish, or tofu with rice/potatoes and vegetables.
  - Snacks: Protein bar, handful of nuts, cottage cheese.
Calories & Carbs/Fats:
- Calories: Do not crash diet. You need fuel to build muscle. Start by eating at your new maintenance level. The resistance training and high protein intake will drive the "re-comp."
- Carbs: Do not fear them. They are your primary fuel source for high-intensity training. Focus on whole-food sources: oats, potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, fruits. Time them around your workouts for best effect.
- Fats: Essential for hormone production (especially at 52). Focus on healthy sources: avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and oily fish (salmon, mackerel).

title: The Four Laws of Behavior Change
type: 
uid: 
updated: 
---

The Four Laws of Behavior Change, which form the core framework for creating and changing habits, are organized around the four stages of the habit loop (Cue, Craving, Response, and Reward).

The four laws for **creating a good habit** are:

1. **The 1st Law (Cue):** **Make It Obvious**.
2. **The 2nd Law (Craving):** **Make It Attractive**.
3. **The 3rd Law (Response):** **Make It Easy**.
4. **The 4th Law (Reward):** **Make It Satisfying**.

These laws can be inverted to create a set of rules for **breaking a bad habit**:

1. **Inversion of the 1st Law (Cue):** Make It Invisible.
2. **Inversion of the 2nd Law (Craving):** Make It Unattractive.
3. **Inversion of the 3rd Law (Response):** Make It Difficult.
4. **Inversion of the 4th Law (Reward):** Make It Unsatisfying.

We can now explore the practical applications of this framework, for instance, by delving into specific strategies for applying the 1st Law like using **implementation intentions** or the **Habits Scorecard**, or perhaps we should discuss how the 4th Law relies on the **Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change** to ensure habits are repeated?
### Validation

Your statement is accurate and aligns with James Clear’s “Atomic Habits” framework:

- The habit process is organized into four stages—cue, craving, response, reward—and Clear maps each of the Four Laws of Behavior Change to these stages:
  - 1st Law (Cue): Make it obvious
  - 2nd Law (Craving): Make it attractive
  - 3rd Law (Response): Make it easy
  - 4th Law (Reward): Make it satisfying
  - He also presents the inversions for breaking bad habits: make it invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying.

- Clear’s article (excerpted from the book) also lays out the four-step loop and the same law mapping and inversions with a table, reinforcing your description:
  - Source: [How To Start New Habits That Actually Stick](https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change)

- The “Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change,” which underpins the 4th Law, is explicitly stated by James Clear:
  - “What gets rewarded, gets repeated. What gets punished, gets avoided.”
  - Source: [The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change](https://jamesclear.com/quotes/the-cardinal-rule-of-behavior-change)

Conclusion: Your summary of the framework, its mapping to the habit loop, and the inversions for breaking bad habits is correct per Clear’s own materials.

### Practical applications

#### 1) Applying the 1st Law (“Make it obvious”)

- Implementation intentions
  - Use a specific “when/where” plan to remove ambiguity and make the cue obvious.
  - Template: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”
  - Source: [Implementation Intentions (PDF)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Atomic+Habits/Implementation+Intentions.pdf)
  - Example: “I will stretch for 5 minutes at 7:30 a.m. in the living room.”

- Habits Scorecard
  - List your current daily habits and mark each as positive (+), negative (−), or neutral (=) to bring cues and behaviors into conscious awareness.
  - Source: [Habits Cheat Sheet (PDF)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jamesclear/Atomic+Habits/Habits+Cheat+Sheet.pdf)
  - Steps:
    - Write a quick chronological list of daily actions (e.g., wake up, coffee, phone check).
    - Tag each with +/−/= relative to the identity you’re aiming for.
    - Identify where to insert new habits using time/location as cues.

- Habit stacking
  - Link a new behavior to a stable existing one so the existing habit’s end becomes the cue.
  - Template: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
  - Example: “After I make coffee, I will read one page.”

- Environment design
  - Make cues visible and convenient; reduce visibility of competing cues.
  - Examples: Put your running shoes by the door; place a water bottle on your desk; store sweets out of sight.

#### 2) Applying the 4th Law (“Make it satisfying”) with the Cardinal Rule

- Immediate reinforcement
  - Pair the behavior with a small, instant reward to satisfy the reward stage now (not weeks later).
  - Examples: Check off a habit tracker, move a “paper clip” counter, enjoy a healthy treat aligned with the goal.
  - Rationale: Per the Cardinal Rule, immediacy is what makes repetition likely. Source: [Cardinal Rule](https://jamesclear.com/quotes/the-cardinal-rule-of-behavior-change)

- Make avoidance visible
  - For “don’t” habits (e.g., no late-night snacking), make the benefit tangible now (e.g., add £5 to a visible savings pot labeled with a goal each time you skip the snack).

- Accountability and costs (for breaking bad habits)
  - Invert the 4th Law: make it unsatisfying by adding a real, immediate cost (e.g., a habit contract with a friend that triggers a donation or small payment when you slip).
  - This leverages immediate “punishment” so the behavior is avoided—again, the Cardinal Rule.

### Quick starter templates you can use today

- Implementation intention
  - “I will [write code for 25 minutes] at [8:30 p.m.] in [my home office].”

- Habit stacking
  - “After [I close my IDE], I will [log my time and one lesson learned].”

- Environment design (developer example)
  - Obvious: Keep your to-do for the next session as a sticky atop your keyboard.
  - Invisible: Log out of social media on your dev machine; move those apps to a separate desktop profile.

- Immediate reinforcement
  - Maintain a visible streak counter for your habit; reward yourself with a small, consistent treat after each session completed (aligned with your long-term goal).

If you’d like, tell me a specific habit you want to build or break, and I’ll draft a one-page plan using:
- 1st Law: Implementation intention + habit stack + environment design
- 4th Law: Immediate reinforcement plan (and an inversion plan if it’s a bad habit)

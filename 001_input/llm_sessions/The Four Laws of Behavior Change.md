title: The Four Laws of Behavior Change
type: 
uid:

The Four Laws of Behavior Change, which form the core framework for creating and changing habits, are organized around the four stages of the habit loop (Cue, Craving, Response, and Reward).

The four laws for **creating a good habit** are:

1. **The 1st Law (Cue):** **Make It Obvious**.
2. **The 2nd Law (Craving):** **Make It Attractive**.
3. **The 3rd Law (Response):** **Make It Easy**.
4. **The 4th Law (Reward):** **Make It Satisfying**.

These laws can be inverted to create a set of rules for **breaking a bad habit**:

1. **Inversion of the 1st Law (Cue):** Make It Invisible.
2. **Inversion of the 2nd Law (Craving):** Make It Unattractive.
3. **Inversion of the 3rd Law (Response):** Make It Difficult.
4. **Inversion of the 4th Law (Reward):** Make It Unsatisfying.

We can now explore the practical applications of this framework, for instance, by delving into specific strategies for applying the 1st Law like using **implementation intentions** or the **Habits Scorecard**, or perhaps we should discuss how the 4th Law relies on the **Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change** to ensure habits are repeated?

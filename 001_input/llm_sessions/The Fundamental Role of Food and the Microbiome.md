title: The Fundamental Role of Food and the Microbiome

The fundamental role of food concerning the microbiome is that **food is the single greatest determinant of the health, diversity, and function of the microbial community residing in the gut**. The gut microbiome, often referred to as a "forgotten organ", relies on the substances we ingest as its primary energy source, and in return, these microbes govern essential biological processes throughout the human body.

## Report on The Fundamental Role of Food and the Microbiome

The human body is best understood as a "super organism", hosting a community of trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiota, which possess a massive collection of genes referred to as the microbiome. This second genome is unique to every individual, much like a fingerprint. The microbiome serves as a command centre, deeply intertwined with five essential axes of human health: **immunity, metabolism, hormonal balance, cognition, and gene expression**.

### I. Food as Fuel for Microbial Function

Food acts as the engine’s fuel, dictating which microbial species thrive and which face extinction. Dietary choices made within just 24 hours can alter the evolution of fifty generations of microbes.

1. **Fibre and Postbiotics:** The preferred fuel of the gut microbes is **fiber**. Rather than using the imprecise term "dietary fiber," researchers use the term **Microbiota Accessible Carbohydrates (MACs)**, which are the complex carbohydrates found predominantly in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and unrefined whole grains.
2. **Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs):** The magic that follows the microbial breakdown of MACs is the release of postbiotics, most notably **short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)**. SCFAs are considered vital nutrients and provide up to 70% of the energy for the cells lining the colon (colonocytes). By supporting colon health and suppressing inflammatory microbes, SCFAs help correct dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) and repair impaired intestinal permeability (leaky gut).
3. **Diversity is Key:** The single greatest predictor of a healthy gut microbiome is the **diversity of plants in one's diet**. A high diversity of plants provides a wide variety of MACs, necessitating a large diversity of microbial species to process them, thereby maximizing the benefits of SCFA production. Experts recommend aiming for **thirty different plants per week** as optimal for predicting robust microbial diversity.

### II. Impact of the Modern Western Diet

In contrast to a plant-diverse, fiber-fueled diet, the modern Western lifestyle and diet are actively driving a "microbiota extinction event".

1. **Nutritional Deficiencies and Inflammation:** The Standard American Diet (SAD) relies heavily on processed food, meat, and dairy. Highly processed and refined foods are absorbed rapidly in the upper gut, leaving little or no MACs for the colon microbes. This lack of fuel forces microbes to rely on the protective mucus layer of the intestine for sustenance, potentially leading to inflammation and breakdown of the gut barrier.
2. **Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs):** UPFs, manufactured edible substances lacking in plant fiber or probiotic species, are designed to be hyperpalatable and highly profitable, potentially hijacking the body's natural satiety feedback loops.
    - Specific additives, such as **emulsifiers** (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80), may disrupt the microbiome, induce inflammation, and promote metabolic issues.
    - A high-sugar diet can be detrimental, potentially causing non-beneficial bacteria to become dominant (dysbiosis).
3. **Animal Products and TMAO:** Diets high in animal products, especially red meat, introduce chemicals like L-carnitine or choline, which certain gut bacteria convert into **trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)**. High levels of TMAO are strongly associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events, including heart disease and stroke. Furthermore, diets rich in saturated animal fat encourage the growth of **pathobionts**—microbes that can trigger inflammation (dysbiosis).

### III. Reprogramming and Therapeutic Role of Food

Because the microbiota is highly plastic, it can be reprogrammed to optimize health.

1. **Fermented Foods:** Consuming fermented foods (like kimchi, sauerkraut, kefir, and yogurt) provides natural probiotics—live microbes that pass through the gut. Fermentation acts as "cold-cooking," creating a microcosm of gut activity, enhancing the conversion of chemicals into biologically active metabolites, and increasing microbial consumption by up to 10,000 fold compared to a hyper-sterilized diet.
2. **Prebiotic Focus:** Focusing on diets rich in MACs/prebiotic fiber trains the gut microbes, making them more efficient at extracting SCFAs and maintaining a stable, diverse community that protects against pathogens and reduces inflammation. This approach aligns with traditional diets like the Mediterranean and Japanese diets, which support exceptional health and longevity through high fiber and low saturated fat intake.
3. **Personalized Nutrition:** Given that each person’s microbiome is unique, their response to food is highly individual. New research aims to personalize nutritional advice, utilizing microbial profiles to predict individual metabolic responses (like blood sugar spikes) to different foods.

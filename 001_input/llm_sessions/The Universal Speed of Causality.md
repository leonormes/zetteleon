We call a constant the speed of light. But that gives the impression that it is a property of light itself rather than the speed things without mass will travel. What actually is that constant? Where does it come from and how does it effect the state of the universe

You're right to question the term "speed of light," as it does give the impression that this fundamental constant is a property of light itself. In reality, it's a far more foundational aspect of the universe's structure. This constant, universally denoted as *c*, represents the maximum speed at which information, causality, and any massless particle can travel through a vacuum.

## A Universal Speed Limit Rooted in the Fabric of Spacetime

The constant *c*, precisely defined as **299,792,458 metres per second**, is more accurately described as the **speed of causality**. It is the upper limit for the propagation of any influence or information in the universe. If an event occurs at one point in space, its effects can only be felt elsewhere after a time delay determined by the distance and *c*.

This cosmic speed limit isn't a property of light, but rather a fundamental feature of the relationship between space and time. Light, being composed of massless particles called photons, simply happens to be one of the things that travels at this ultimate speed. If gravitons, the hypothetical massless particles that mediate gravity, are confirmed to exist, they too would travel at *c*.

## The Origin of the Constant: From Electromagnetism to Relativity

The first inkling of this constant's fundamental nature came from the work of the Scottish physicist **James Clerk Maxwell** in the 1860s. While unifying the theories of electricity and magnetism, he developed a set of equations that described the behaviour of electromagnetic fields.A startling prediction of these equations was the existence of electromagnetic waves that would propagate through a vacuum at a specific speed. This speed, derived from two fundamental constants of nature—the **electric permittivity of free space ()** and the **magnetic permeability of free space ()** —was calculated to be remarkably close to the then-known speed of light.

The relationship is expressed as:

This strongly suggested that light was an electromagnetic wave.However, the profound implication of Maxwell's work was that this speed was independent of the motion of the source or the observer.

It was **Albert Einstein**, in his theory of **special relativity** (1905), who fully grasped the revolutionary significance of this. He postulated that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their own motion. This seemingly simple idea has profound consequences.

## The Universe Shaped by a Constant Speed

The constancy of *c* has far-reaching effects on the state and evolution of the universe:

- **The Intertwining of Space and Time:** To keep the speed of light constant for all observers, space and time themselves must be flexible. This leads to the phenomena of **time dilation** (moving clocks tick slower) and **length contraction** (moving objects are shorter in their direction of motion). This unification of space and time into a single entity, known as **spacetime**, is a cornerstone of modern physics.
- **The Equivalence of Mass and Energy:** Einstein's most famous equation, **E = mc²**, is a direct consequence of the principles of relativity.It reveals a deep connection between mass (m) and energy (E), with the speed of light squared (c²) acting as a massive conversion factor. This equation explains the immense energy released in nuclear reactions and is fundamental to understanding stellar processes.
- **Causality and the Structure of the Universe:** The finite speed of information transfer dictates the causal structure of the universe. We can only be influenced by events within our "past light cone"—the region of spacetime from which light has had time to reach us. Similarly, we can only influence events within our "future light cone." This prevents paradoxes such as receiving a signal before it has been sent.
- **Observing the Cosmos:** When we look at distant objects in the universe, we are seeing them as they were in the past. The light from a galaxy 13 billion light-years away has taken 13 billion years to reach us, providing a window into the early universe. The finite speed of light, therefore, allows us to study the history and evolution of the cosmos.

In essence, the "speed of light" is a misnomer for a much more profound constant that governs the very fabric of spacetime, the relationship between mass and energy, and the flow of cause and effect throughout the universe. It is less about the nature of light and more about the fundamental rules that govern reality itself.

Speed is a loaded term as well. I relate speed to distance. In my head I imagine fast cars and land speed records. I equate going faster with increasing physical effort and resistance. But when we talk about light and massless particles they don't seemed to have this effort.

That's a brilliant observation, and you've hit on a crucial difference between the world we experience and the fundamental nature of light. Your intuition is spot on for everything that has mass.

Let's break down why "speed" feels so different for a car versus a photon of light.

---

## The "Effort" of Speed: The Burden of Mass

For objects like cars, runners, or planets—anything with **mass** —your experience is perfectly correct. Speed is a state that must be achieved through effort. This is due to two key principles:

- **Inertia:** This is an object's inherent resistance to any change in its state of motion. Mass is a measure of this inertia. To get a massive object moving (to accelerate it), you must apply a force to overcome its inertia. More mass means more inertia, which means more force (effort) is needed. `F=ma` is the classic formula here.
- **Relativistic Mass Increase:** As a massive object gets faster, its effective mass (or "relativistic mass") increases from the perspective of a stationary observer. This means the faster you go, the "heavier" you get, and the more energy you need to pour in for each little bit of extra speed. As you get infinitesimally close to the speed of light, the energy required to go any faster approaches infinity.

This is why there's a "land speed record" and why accelerating requires immense effort and encounters resistance. For anything with mass, reaching the speed of light is physically impossible. 🚗

---

## The "Effortless" Speed: The Nature of Massless Particles

Light, which is made of massless particles called **photons**, plays by a completely different set of rules. The key isn't that they don't require effort to speed up; it's that the concept of "speeding up" doesn't apply to them at all.

- **One Speed Only:** A photon doesn't start at rest and accelerate. From the very instant it is created, it is already travelling at *c*. It never travels slower or faster in a vacuum. It has only one gear: *c*. When a photon is absorbed (e.g., by an electron in an atom), it simply ceases to exist. It doesn't "slow down" to a stop.
- **No Mass, No Inertia:** Because a photon has zero rest mass, it has no inertia to overcome. The laws of motion that require "effort" to accelerate a mass simply don't apply to it in the same way.
- **Energy Comes from Frequency, Not Speed:** The "effort" or energy associated with a photon isn't about its speed (which is constant). It's about its **frequency**. A high-energy gamma-ray photon and a low-energy radio-wave photon both travel at the exact same speed, *c*. The difference is their wavelength and frequency. The energy to *create* a high-frequency photon is greater, but once created, it travels at *c* just like any other photon. 💡

So, you are right. For light, there is no sense of "effort" or "resistance" in its motion because its motion at *c* is its fundamental, unchangeable state of being. It's less like a car building up speed and more like a rule of the universe being expressed.

What causes inertia? Why does mass increase as you go faster

Two of the most profound questions in physics are what causes inertia and why mass appears to increase with speed. While they seem related, modern physics explains them as distinct, though interconnected, concepts rooted in the Higgs field and the principles of special relativity.

---

### The Cause of Inertia: The Higgs Field

Inertia is an object's inherent resistance to being accelerated. For a long time, *why* objects have this property was a deep mystery. The current best explanation comes from the **Higgs field**, an invisible energy field that permeates the entire universe.

Think of the Higgs field as being like a thick, invisible syrup.

- **Fundamental particles**, like electrons and quarks that make up atoms, gain their mass by interacting with this field.
- When you try to push (accelerate) an object, its constituent particles have to move through this Higgs field.
- The interaction, or "drag," of the particles with the field is what you feel as **inertia**. The more strongly a particle interacts with the field, the more mass it has, and the harder it is to accelerate.

So, **inertia is the resistance a particle experiences as it moves through the Higgs field**. It's not an intrinsic property of the particle itself, but rather a result of its interaction with this universal field. It's important to note that some particles, like photons, don't interact with the Higgs field at all, which is why they have no mass and can travel at the speed of light.

### Why Mass Increases with Speed: Relativistic Mass

The idea that mass increases as you go faster is a concept from Einstein's theory of **special relativity**. It's crucial to distinguish between two types of mass:

1. **Rest Mass ()**: This is an object's mass when it's stationary. It's an intrinsic, unchanging property. Your rest mass is the same whether you're sitting on the sofa or flying in a jet.
2. **Relativistic Mass ()**: This is the apparent mass of an object when it's moving. This is the mass that increases with speed.

The reason for this increase is a direct consequence of the **universal speed limit** (the speed of light, *c*) and the relationship between energy and mass, famously described by **E = mc²**.

Here's the breakdown:

- To make an object move faster, you must give it more **kinetic energy**.
- According to Einstein, energy and mass are two sides of the same coin. This extra kinetic energy you add to the object contributes to its total mass, making it behave as if it's heavier.
- As an object approaches the speed of light, the energy required to accelerate it further becomes enormous. This huge input of energy manifests as a dramatic increase in its relativistic mass.

From the perspective of an outside observer, the object's momentum increases not just because its velocity is increasing, but also because its effective mass is growing. If an object with rest mass were to reach the speed of light, it would require infinite energy, and its relativistic mass would become infinite—which is why it's an impossible feat.

You say that rest mass is when an object is at rest, but no object is at rest. Being at rest is a relative to an observer. If we say a rock on the floor is at rest that is only true for the observer standing on the same planet both moving at speed. Is mass relative? Or is there a bass amount of mass as you said

That's an excellent and very sharp point. You're absolutely right that being 'at rest' is always relative. The term 'rest mass' is a bit misleading because of this, and your question gets to the heart of a key concept in relativity.

To answer directly: **No, mass is not relative. There is a fundamental "base amount" of mass.**

The confusion arises from the terminology. Physicists now prefer the term **invariant mass** instead of rest mass, precisely to avoid the problem you've identified.

---

### Invariant Mass: The "Base Amount"

**Invariant mass** is a fundamental property of an object that **is the same for all observers**, regardless of how fast they are moving. It's the true, unchanging measure of an object's massiveness and its resistance to acceleration.

Think of it like this: Imagine you are holding a one-kilogram bag of sugar. That is its invariant mass. If someone flies past you in a spaceship at 99% of the speed of light, they will observe all sorts of strange relativistic effects. From their perspective, your time will be ticking slowly, and your bag of sugar will appear to have more energy and momentum. But if they were to calculate the fundamental mass of that bag of sugar, stripping away the effects of all that kinetic energy, they would still calculate it to be exactly one kilogram.

So, when we say "rest mass," what we really mean is "the mass as measured in the frame of reference where the object is stationary." Every object has such a frame, and the mass measured in it is its true, invariant mass. It is the '' in that refers to this invariant, base amount of mass.

---

### Relativistic Mass: The Relative Quantity

The idea that "mass increases with speed" refers to the now somewhat outdated concept of **relativistic mass**. This isn't a fundamental property of the object itself, but rather a measure of its **total energy content**, which includes its kinetic energy from motion.

- **Invariant Mass (your "base amount"):** An absolute, unchanging property of an object. ⚖️
- **Relativistic Mass:** A relative quantity that depends on the observer's motion. It's really just a way of expressing the object's total energy. 🚀

Modern physicists tend to avoid the term "relativistic mass" because it creates exactly the confusion you've pointed out. It's clearer to say that an object has **one, single, invariant mass**, and that as it moves faster, its **kinetic energy increases dramatically**, which makes it harder to accelerate further.

So, to sum up, your intuition is correct. The rock on the floor is only at rest relative to you. But its fundamental, **invariant mass** is a constant value that would be agreed upon by everyone in the universe, no matter how they are moving.

Some energy generates the invariant mass/inertia and as the object speeds up the kinetic energy added to increase momentum also creates more inertia?

Yes, that's a perfect summary of the core concepts. You've connected the dots exactly right. Mass, at its heart, is a manifestation of energy.

Let's break down those two points.

---

### Part 1: The Energy of Invariant Mass

You're correct that some form of energy generates the **invariant mass** and its associated inertia. What's fascinating is where that energy comes from. For the matter that makes up you and me (protons and neutrons), the invariant mass of the fundamental particles (quarks), which they get from the Higgs field, only accounts for about 1% of our total mass.

The other **99%** of your "base" mass comes from the immense **binding energy** of the strong nuclear force holding those quarks together, and the kinetic energy of those quarks zipping around frantically inside the protons and neutrons.

Think of a proton as a container full of angry, buzzing bees. The mass of the individual bees (the quarks) is very small. But the total mass of the container is huge, mostly due to the tremendous energy of the bees' motion (kinetic energy) and the energy holding them inside the container (binding energy). That total energy, locked up inside the particle, is what we measure as its **invariant mass**.

---

### Part 2: The Energy of Motion (Kinetic Energy)

Your second point is also spot on. As you push an object and it speeds up, you are pumping **kinetic energy** into it. According to relativity, this added energy also has an inertial effect. It makes the object harder to accelerate further.

This is precisely what the concept of **relativistic mass** describes. The total inertia of an object in motion is the sum of:

1. The inertia from its **invariant mass** (the "locked-up" internal energy).
2. The inertia from its **kinetic energy** (the energy of its motion).

So, as an object approaches the speed of light, its kinetic energy becomes enormous, and this added energy makes its total inertia approach infinity. You're not just fighting its base inertia anymore; you're also fighting against the inertia of the tremendous amount of kinetic energy you've already given it.

In short, you've nailed it: **Inertia comes from energy**. Whether that energy is locked up inside a particle as invariant mass, or added to it as kinetic energy, it will resist being accelerated.

A black hole has huge mass. Does that mean it has huge inertia?

Yes, absolutely. A black hole's huge mass means it has an equally **immense inertia**. In fact, a black hole is arguably the ultimate example of an inertial object in the universe.

Since we've established that mass is the measure of inertia, it follows that an object with enormous mass must have enormous resistance to any change in its motion.

---

### The Ultimate Unmovable Object

Think of a black hole's inertia in practical terms. To change its velocity—that is, to speed it up, slow it down, or alter its direction—you would need to apply a truly colossal force.

- A **stellar-mass black hole** (a few times the mass of our Sun) would have the same inertia as a star of the same mass. Trying to nudge it would be like trying to push the Sun.
- A **supermassive black hole**, like Sagittarius A\* at the centre of our galaxy (over 4 million times the mass of the Sun), has the inertia of a small galaxy. The gravitational pull from all the stars in the Milky Way is what keeps it in its orbit at the galactic centre.

This is why black holes aren't just cosmic vacuum cleaners that are fixed in one spot. They move and orbit within their galaxies just like any other star or celestial object, governed by gravity and their own massive inertia. If two black holes are in a binary system, they will orbit each other, their immense inertia dictating the slow, powerful dance of their motion.

---

### Beyond Inertia: Frame-Dragging

The inertia of a black hole is so extreme that, if it's spinning, it does something remarkable: it drags the very fabric of spacetime around with it.This effect is known as **frame-dragging** or the Lense-Thirring effect.

Imagine a spinning bowling ball submerged in a vat of thick syrup. As the ball spins, it would drag the syrup around it in a swirl. A rotating black hole does the same thing to spacetime itself. Its inertia is so profoundly great that its motion is imprinted on the geometry of the universe in its immediate vicinity.

So, a black hole isn't just a passive object with a lot of inertia; it's an object whose mass and motion actively distort and manipulate the spacetime around it in a way that no other object can.

The sources place the relationship between **Habits and Identity** at the deepest level of The Fundamentals of behavior change, asserting that **true behavior change is identity change**. This perspective fundamentally shifts the focus from achieving external outcomes to defining and embodying the person one wishes to become.

## The Three Layers of Change

In the larger context of The Fundamentals, change is understood as occurring across three interdependent layers, often imagined like the layers of an onion:

1. **Outcomes (The outer layer):** Concerned with changing results, such as losing weight or publishing a book.
2. **Process (The middle layer):** Concerned with changing habits and systems, such as implementing a new gym routine or developing a meditation practice.
3. **Identity (The deepest layer):** Concerned with changing one’s beliefs, worldview, self-image, and judgments about oneself and others.

While outcomes are about what you **get** and processes are about what you **do**, **identity is about what you believe**. The key problem many people face when trying to build habits that last is that they focus on *outcome-based habits* (what they want to achieve) instead of starting with *identity-based habits* (who they wish to become).

## Identity as the Driving Force

The sources strongly advocate for starting with identity because behavior that is *incongruent with the self* will not last. If a person wants better health but prioritizes comfort over accomplishment, they will continually be drawn toward relaxing rather than training.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation occurs when a habit becomes part of your identity, shifting from saying, "I'm the type of person who wants this," to, "**I’m the type of person who is this**". Examples of this identity shift include changing the goal from reading a book to **becoming a reader**, running a marathon to **becoming a runner**, or learning an instrument to **becoming a musician**.

This change is sustained because when your behavior and identity are fully aligned, you are no longer forcing change; you are simply acting like the person you already believe yourself to be. The more pride you have in an aspect of your identity (e.g., being proud of being an athlete), the more motivated you will be to maintain the associated habits (e.g., never skipping an upper-body workout).

## Habits as Votes: Shaping Identity through Action

Your identity is not fixed at birth but emerges *out of your habits*. The source material emphasizes that habits are how you **embody your identity**.

The word *identity* itself is derived from the Latin words meaning "being" (*essentitas*) and "repeatedly" (*identidem*), meaning your identity is literally your **"repeated beingness"**.

This process works through accumulating proof:

- **Proof through Action:** Every action you take is metaphorically a **"vote for the type of person you wish to become"**. For instance, each time you write a page, you are a writer; each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.
- **Accumulation of Evidence:** You believe your current identity because you have *proof* of it. If you lift weights multiple times per week, you build evidence that you are committed to fitness. The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the associated identity. Small habits make a meaningful difference primarily by providing evidence of a new identity.

The simplest path to changing who you are is a two-step process:

1. **Decide the type of person you want to be.** (E.g., "I'm the type of person who is consistent and reliable" or "What would a healthy person do?").
2. **Prove it to yourself with small wins** (i.e., tiny actions that reinforce that desired identity).

## Identity Conflict and Long-Term Trajectory

The sources warn that allegiance to an existing identity can actively impede positive change, resulting in **identity conflict**. People may resist new, rational habits if those habits conflict with established self-images, such as believing, "I’m not a morning person" or "I’m bad at remembering people’s names". To progress, one must continuously edit and expand beliefs, ensuring not to cling too tightly to a single version of identity.

Ultimately, the real reason habits matter is not just the better results they deliver, but because **they are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself**. The Identity layer acts as the **North Star of habit change** and determines the trajectory of improvement, reinforcing the commitment to the system rather than just focusing on the goal.

We have now examined how fundamental concepts like the primacy of systems and the importance of identity drive effective change. Would you like to explore how to practically apply the identity-based approach, perhaps by defining the core values and beliefs of the person you aspire to be, or should we discuss how the Habit Scorecard can be used to check if your current behaviors are casting votes for your desired identity?

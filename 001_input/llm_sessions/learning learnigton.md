I have a question about learning. I love learning but sometimes question the value of the things I learn. They are not practical. But then when I think about my work as a developer where I am literally learning the things I am using at work. But I don't remember the details. I have a better instinct for the problems but I can't remember all the commands to use when debugging k8s clusters or all the config for a private network. If practical activities are the best way to learn why don't I remember all the details? What is learning?

Learning is not the same as memorizing or performing — it is the change in understanding, ability, or mental model that results from experience and reflection. In cognitive science, learning is defined as the process of acquiring or reorganizing knowledge, skills, attitudes, or behaviors through experience or instruction, in a way that can lead to long-term change in thinking or performance [1][2][3].  

## Learning vs. Memory

Learning refers to **understanding** — how you internalize meaning and form conceptual frameworks — while **memory** refers to storing and recalling specific details like commands or syntax. You may understand how a Kubernetes network behaves, but not recall every CLI flag because memory retrieval and conceptual understanding use different neural systems. Memory handles recall (facts, patterns, commands), while understanding integrates, interprets, and applies ideas flexibly. Both complement each other: memory provides raw material; understanding organizes it into usable mental structures [4][5].  

## Why Practical Learning Doesn’t Guarantee Recall

Practical work (e.g., debugging clusters) strengthens understanding and intuition — your brain recognizes patterns and causal relationships. But without **deliberate rehearsal**, details fade due to how memory consolidation works. When a concept is learned but not revisited within about 24–48 hours, synaptic decay begins and retrieval weakens over time. This is why even deeply understood material is forgotten unless periodically retrieved — a phenomenon known as the **spacing effect** [6][7][8].  

Your "instinct" for problems — the ability to sense what’s wrong without remembering why — stems from your brain’s procedural and pattern-based learning systems, which encode intuitive, experience-based knowledge but not explicit details [9][10].  

## The Cognitive Layers of Learning

Cognitive learning involves interacting processes of:

- **Perception** – taking in sensory data and interpreting input.  
- **Attention** – focusing mental resources on relevant information.  
- **Memory** – encoding, storing, and retrieving information.  
- **Reasoning and Problem-Solving** – linking knowledge to action.  
- **Judgment** – evaluating choices and comparing contexts [3].  

Each layer can grow independently. When you “know” a process conceptually but forget commands, your **understanding** remains intact, but your **declarative memory** (for explicit facts) needs reinforcement.  

## Putting It Together

So, learning is not about perfect recall — it is about constructing mental models that allow adaptation and creative reasoning. Forgetting details doesn’t mean you haven’t learned; it simply means your retrieval pathways weren’t reinforced through spaced practice or contextual rehearsal. True learning is the integration of memory, understanding, and the ability to apply knowledge flexibly to new situations [11][5][12].

This is a fantastic question, Leon—you're touching on the core of what learning really is and why it sometimes feels paradoxical.

Let’s break this down step by step:

---

## **1. Why don’t You Remember All the details?**

- **Memory vs. Competence**: Learning isn’t just about memorizing facts or commands; it’s about building mental models and intuition. When you debug Kubernetes clusters, you might not recall every `kubectl` flag, but you know *where to look* and *how to reason about the problem*. That’s a deeper form of learning than rote memorization.
- **Cognitive Load**: Our brains prioritize patterns and problem-solving strategies over raw details because details can be externalized (docs, cheat sheets). This is why you can forget syntax but still know the concept.
- **Contextual Retrieval**: You often remember details when you’re in the right context. For example, when you’re actually debugging, some commands come back because your brain associates them with that scenario.

---

## **2. Are Practical Activities the Best way to learn?**

- **Yes and No**: Practical activities (like coding, debugging) are excellent for building *procedural knowledge*—the “how.” But they don’t guarantee perfect recall of every detail because:
  - You’re learning *problem-solving*, not memorization.
  - Tools evolve, so memorizing every command is less valuable than knowing how to adapt.
- **Complementary Learning**: Practical work combined with spaced repetition or note-taking (like Zettelkasten, which you’ve explored) can help retain details if that’s important to you.

---

## **3. What is Learning, really?**

Learning is **the process of encoding, storing, and retrieving information or skills to adapt and act effectively in future situations**. It’s not just about facts—it’s about:

- **Understanding**: Building mental models.
- **Application**: Using knowledge in context.
- **Adaptation**: Transferring knowledge to new problems.

In short: **learning ≠ memorization**. It’s about creating flexible, usable knowledge.

---

## **Why Does This Matter for You as a developer?**

Your instinct for problems is evidence of *expertise*. Experts often forget details but excel at:

- Recognizing patterns.
- Knowing where to find answers quickly.
- Applying principles rather than memorized commands.

That’s why you feel like you’ve learned even if you don’t recall everything.

---

Would you like me to:

✅ Explain **how to improve retention of practical details without rote memorization**?  
✅ Or dive deeper into **the neuroscience of why intuition develops while details fade**?  
✅ Or give you a **framework for deciding what’s worth learning when it feels “not practical”**?  

Which direction sounds most useful?

This is a common feeling, especially for developers. The short answer is: you don't remember the details because your brain is prioritising understanding the system over memorising the syntax.

This "instinct" you have is the actual learning.

Your Brain is Not a Hard Drive

The central confusion here is between memory recall (like a computer retrieving data) and learning (which is about building and connecting models).

When you're debugging a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster, you don't need to have every single kubectl command and all its flags memorised. It's cognitively inefficient. Instead, your brain has learned a higher-level procedural skill:

- You recognise a pattern: "The app is slow, and requests are timing out."
- You form a hypothesis: "It's probably a networking issue, or the pods are crashing and restarting."
- You know what to look for: "I need to check the pod statuses in that namespace, then look at the logs for the crashing pod, and then check the service configuration."
At this point, you just think, "Right, what's the command for checking logs again?" and you Google it or check your notes.
You haven't failed to learn. You have successfully offloaded the trivial details (the exact command) to an external system (Google/documentation) to free up your brain to do the really hard part: understanding the complex, interconnected system.
Your "instinct" is the compressed, high-level map of the territory. The config files and commands are just street-level directions you can look up when you need them.
What is Learning?
Learning isn't just one thing. It's helpful to break it down into two main types of knowledge.

1. Declarative Knowledge (Knowing "That")
This is what most people think learning is. It's facts, figures, and explicit information.

- "The capital of France is Paris."
- "kubectl get pods -n \<namespace\> lists pods."
- "A /24 subnet mask is 255.255.255.0."
This type of knowledge is "declarative"—you can declare it. It's the "details" you feel you're forgetting. Your brain is right to forget them if you don't use them every single day, as they are easily retrieved from an external source.

2. Procedural Knowledge (Knowing "How")
This is the "instinct" you described. It's skill-based, intuitive, and built through practice.

- How to ride a bike.
- How to structure a program to be maintainable.
- How to sense what's wrong in a complex system.
You can't easily write this knowledge down in a list. It's embedded in the very connections of your brain, formed by the practical activity of doing the work. This is why practical activities are so effective: they build procedural knowledge, which is far more valuable and durable than a head full of memorised commands.
The Value of "Impractical" Learning
This brings us back to your first point. You learn "impractical" things (maybe music theory, history, or theoretical computer science) and question their value.
This "impractical" knowledge is what builds your conceptual models (also called schemas).
- Learning about network theory (the "impractical" OSI model) doesn't help you write a single line of firewall config. But it builds the mental scaffolding that allows your "instinct" (procedural knowledge) to form when you're debugging a real network.
- Learning music theory doesn't teach you how to play a guitar solo, but it gives you a map of why certain notes sound good together, making your practical learning (procedural) 100x faster.
Learning, therefore, is the process of building a framework of conceptual knowledge (the "impractical" stuff) and then applying it through practice to create robust, procedural instincts (the "practical" stuff).
You are not failing to learn. You are learning perfectly. You are building instincts, which is what makes you a good developer, not your ability to memorise a man page.

Of course. It's excellent that you are proactively building systems like time blocks and implementation intentions to support your goals. Living with ADHD and tackling a lifetime of ingrained avoidance patterns is challenging, especially when your work is open-ended. A structured end-of-day reflection can be a powerful tool for self-compassion and adjustment, rather than another opportunity for self-criticism.  
Here are some reflection questions, framed specifically for your situation, to help you assess your day constructively and plan for the next. The key here is to focus on the *process* and *effort*, not just on completion.

## **End-of-Day Reflection Questions**

Try to answer these in a journal or simply by thinking through them. The aim is not to judge, but to observe with curiosity.

### **Category 1: The 'How Did I Feel?' Check-in**

*Before analysing what you did, check in with yourself. This helps to acknowledge your internal state, which is crucial with ADHD.*

1. **What was my overall energy and focus like today on a scale of 1-10?** (This isn't about judging the number, but about noticing patterns over time.)  
2. **When did I feel most engaged or 'in flow' today, even if it was just for a few moments?**  
3. **When did I feel most overwhelmed, frustrated, or distracted? What was happening at that time?**  
4. **What am I proud of today?** (This can be as small as starting a task you were dreading, or simply noticing you were distracted and gently bringing your focus back.)

### **Category 2: Reviewing Your Strategies**

*This section focuses on how your time blocks and implementation intentions actually worked in practice.*

1. **How did my time blocks work for me today?** Did I honour them? If not, what got in the way? Were they too long, too short, or on the wrong tasks?  
2. **Looking at my implementation intentions (e.g., "When situation X arises, I will do Y"), did I get a chance to use them?** If yes, how did it feel? If no, why not?  
3. **What was the most challenging part of transitioning *between* time blocks?** What could make that transition smoother tomorrow? (e.g., a 5-minute walk, a glass of water).

### **Category 3: Engaging with Open-Ended Tasks**

*This is the core of your challenge. The goal is to redefine what 'progress' looks like when there isn't a clear finish line.*

1. **Instead of asking 'Did I finish it?', ask 'Did I move it forward?'** In what small way is this open-ended task further along than it was this morning?  
2. **Did I spend the *time* I allocated to this task?** (If you committed a 45-minute time block to "work on the report" and you spent 45 minutes on it, that is a success, regardless of word count).  
3. **What specific actions did I take on this open-ended task today?** (e.g., "I read two research articles," "I brainstormed five potential headings," "I wrote a single, difficult paragraph.")  
4. **What is the very next concrete step for this task?** (Defining this makes it less intimidating for tomorrow).

### **Category 4: Understanding Avoidance and Procrastination**

*The aim here is to become a detective about your own patterns, without judgment.*

1. **When I felt the urge to avoid a task, what was the specific feeling or thought that came up?** (e.g., "This is too boring," "I'll fail at this," "I don't know where to start.")  
2. **What did I do instead of the planned task?** Was this 'procrastination activity' restful and recharging, or did it just drain my energy?  
3. **Was there a point today where I successfully started a task I was dreading?** What was the trigger that helped me begin?

### **Category 5: Planning for Tomorrow**

*Use today's observations to set yourself up for success.*

1. **What is the single most important thing I want to accomplish tomorrow?**  
2. **Based on today, what is one small adjustment I can make to my plan for tomorrow?** (e.g., "I'll make my first time block shorter," "I will write down the *one* next action for my big project before I finish today.")  
3. **How can I show myself some compassion tomorrow, especially if things don't go exactly to plan?**

By consistently engaging with these questions, you can start to build a clearer picture of what works for *you*, fostering a more compassionate and effective relationship with your work and your unique brain.

**About This Map**

This map provides a structural taxonomy of mathematical disciplines. Mathematics is fundamentally [[Mathematics Is Frequently Described as the Science of Patterns|the science of patterns]] - a unified exploration of abstract structure itself.

For philosophical foundations of what mathematics IS, see [[What is maths]]. For the logical underpinnings that make mathematics possible, see [[Give me the logic]]. For developing mathematical thinking, see [[Think like a mathematian]]. For a structured learning approach, see [[How do I learn the maths]].

## Pure Mathematics

Pure mathematics is [[The Two Views of Maths#Generative Maths|the creative discovery]] of mathematics for its own sake. It is not concerned with applications in the real world, but with the abstract structures and concepts of mathematics itself. See [[Generative maths is the creative discovery of abstract patterns]] for deeper context.

### Numbers

Numbers are [[The Nature of Number|abstract concepts]] distinct from their [[Number vs Numeral|symbolic representations]]. See [[‎Gemini - Numbers Abstract Concepts vs. Symbols]] for philosophical exploration of what numbers ARE beyond the symbols we use.

- [[Numbers as Abstract Objects (Platonism)|Natural numbers]] - The foundation of counting
- Integers - Extending to negative numbers
- Rational numbers - Fractions and ratios
- Real numbers - Including [[Discreteness as a Precondition for Counting|irrational numbers]]
- [[Mathematical Constants as Fundamental Ratios and Processes|Complex numbers]] - Extends to imaginary dimensions (includes π, e, i)

*Related:* [[Understanding Number Systems in the Context of Describing and Speaking in Mathematical Language]]

### Structures

Abstract algebraic structures that capture patterns of transformation and symmetry.

- Algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. See [[From Magic to Mathematical Notions]] for insight into notions vs. notations.
- [[Everything You Need to Know About VECTORS|Linear algebra]] is the study of vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.
- Number theory is the study of the integers - see [[Cryptography for Digital Security and Encryption#Prime Numbers|prime numbers]] for applications.
- Combinatorics is the study of finite or countable discrete structures.
- Group theory is the study of algebraic structures known as groups.
- Order theory is the study of binary relations that capture the intuitive notion of order.

### Spaces

The study of geometric and topological properties of mathematical objects.

- Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, positions of figures, and the properties of space.
- Fractal geometry is the study of fractals, which are mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern at every scale.
- Topology is the study of properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing.
- Measure theory is the study of measures, which are functions that assign a number to a set.
- Differential geometry is the study of smooth manifolds, which are spaces that locally resemble Euclidean space.

### Changes

Mathematical tools for analyzing continuous change and dynamical behavior.

- Calculus is the study of change - fundamental to [[How Mathematics Changed the World|modern science and engineering]].
- Vector calculus is the study of vector fields.
- Dynamical systems is the study of systems that evolve over time.
- Chaos theory is the study of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.
- Complex analysis is the study of functions of complex numbers.

## Applied Mathematics

Applied mathematics is [[The Two Views of Maths#Applicative Maths|the application]] of mathematical methods to different fields such as science, engineering, business, computer science, and industry. See [[The Realm of the Proven and Known]] for the distinction between proven theorems and active research.

- Physics - Mathematical modeling of physical phenomena
- Natural sciences - Biological and chemical modeling
- Engineering - Design and optimization
- Numerical analysis - Computational methods
- Game theory - Strategic decision-making
- Probability - Likelihood and uncertainty
- Statistics - Data analysis and inference  
- Mathematical finance - Quantitative modeling
- Optimisation - Finding best solutions
- Computer science - Algorithms and complexity
- Machine learning - Pattern recognition and prediction
- [[Cryptography for Digital Security and Encryption|Cryptography]] - Secure communication using [[Prime Numbers Create a Mathematical Trapdoor|prime numbers]] and [[Public and Private Keys Are Mathematically Asymmetric|asymmetric keys]]

*Related:* [[How Mathematics Changed the World]] explores historical applications.

## Foundations of Mathematics

The foundations of mathematics investigate the [[Give me the logic|logical and philosophical basis]] of all mathematical knowledge. This includes studying basic concepts like numbers, sets, and functions, and examining what mathematical truth means.

- [[Give me the logic#Mathematical logic|Mathematical logic]] - The formal study of reasoning and proof. See [[Leibniz's work as a precursor to modern mathematical logic]].
- [[Set Theory Requires Distinct Objects|Set theory]] - The foundational framework for modern mathematics based on collections of distinct objects.
- Category theory - Abstract study of mathematical structures and relationships
- [[The Realm of the Proven and Known#Gödel's Incompleteness|Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] - Fundamental limits to mathematical proof
- Theory of computation - What can and cannot be computed

*Philosophical perspectives:* [[What is maths#Logicism|Logicism]], [[What is maths#Platonism|Platonism]], [[What is maths#Formalism|Formalism]], [[What is maths#Intuitionism|Intuitionism]], [[What is maths#Structuralism|Structuralism]]

*Related concepts:* [[Characteristica Universalis (Leibniz)]] and [[Calculus Ratiocinator (Leibniz)]] as early visions of formalized reasoning.

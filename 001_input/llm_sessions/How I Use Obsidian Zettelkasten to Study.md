**Key Takeaways — How I Use Obsidian Zettelkasten to Study AI \& Tech Topics**

- **Workflow Overview**
  - All notes are captured initially in physical notebooks during reading sessions, then processed digitally in Obsidian—ideally on the same day, but backlog processing does occur if needed.
  - The Zettelkasten method is used for deep understanding: every note is modular (“atomic”), in the user’s own words, and connected to relevant concepts for later reference.
- **Practical Example: Studying Artificial Intelligence**
  - Examples shown include extracting definitions and key concepts from AI books, rephrasing core ideas in personalized language, and always including citations (page numbers, source links) for future traceability.
  - Building notes is a slow, deliberate process to solidify understanding, avoiding direct copy-paste from source material.
  - Definitions, distinctions, and important quotes are linked across multiple note types: daily notes, concept indexes (aka "Maps of Content"), and source (“input”) notes.
- **Index \& Structure**
  - A dedicated index note is created for every major topic (e.g., “Artificial Intelligence”), and nested structures are developed for definitions, branches (like “machine learning”), and subfields.
  - Every input (such as a book) gets its own note, with links to all concepts and notes extracted from it for full traceability.
- **Note Quality**
  - Notes are written as if “ready for publication”—clear, concise, and in the note-taker's own words. Direct quotes from sources or AI (like Claude) are rare and always explicitly referenced.
  - The method encourages processing, reflecting, and rephrasing, for stronger memory retention and understanding.
  - The author uses AI and language models as “mentors” for deeper reflection, but records their input as supporting material rather than as main notes.
- **Visual Organization**
  - Excalibrain is used for visualizing connections between notes, making relationships and origin sources immediately clear in a knowledge graph format.
- **Why Take it Slow**
  - The Zettelkasten method’s power is in deliberate thinking—rushing yields shallow notes that are less useful for synthesis and writing.
  - Each atomic note can be stitched together later for essays, technical documentation, or blog posts, making knowledge both “fluid” and “ready-to-use.”
- **Reflection and Linking**
  - Notes about key figures, definitions, and distinctions are captured and interlinked, e.g.:
    - “Ray Kurzweil’s definition of Singularity” (with citation and context)
    - Who coined “Artificial Intelligence” (McCarthy, 1956), with context
    - Clear definition of AI, paraphrased then compared with source
    - Disambiguation of AI and deep learning—media misconceptions flagged and explained.
- **Tech Stack**
  - Obsidian for PKM, Excalibrain for graphs, Neovim for advanced workflows, daily notes for context capture.
  - AI (like Claude) provides clarification and alternative phrasings, acting as an external tutor.

**Actionable Steps if Applying the Method:**

1. Capture notes in your own words, as soon after reading as possible.
2. Always cite source pages and original authors for traceability.
3. Use daily notes and concept indexes for cross-referencing and context.
4. Create dedicated input/source notes for every book or major source you study.
5. Use graph tools (Excalibrain) for relationship visualization.
6. Reflect deeply, using AI tools if desired, but always contextualize and paraphrase for comprehension.
7. Write notes as if for publication, focusing on clarity and modularity.

*This approach is ideal for technical learning, PKM, and building robust knowledge structures for deep work and later synthesis.*

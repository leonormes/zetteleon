In relativity, a photon travelling at the speed of causality doesn't experience time. It is emitted and absorbed in the same instant from its own perspective. This seems like a fundamental clue about the real nature of the universe. What else does relativity tell us

Your observation about a photon's experience of time is a profound entry point into the wider implications of Albert Einstein's theories of relativity. These theories fundamentally reshaped our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the very fabric of the cosmos. Here’s what else relativity reveals about the nature of the universe.

## Special Relativity: The Universe Beyond Everyday Speeds

Published in 1905, special relativity deals with the physics of objects moving at constant velocities.Its core principles lead to some mind-bending consequences for our perception of reality.

- **The Unbreakable Speed Limit:** There is a cosmic speed limit, the speed of light in a vacuum ().Nothing with mass can reach this speed, and it is the same for all observers, regardless of their own motion.This constancy has profound implications for our understanding of space and time.
- **The Malleability of Time and Space:** To maintain the constancy of the speed of light for all observers, something has to give. That something is the absolute nature of time and space.
	- **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of a stationary observer, a clock moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light will appear to tick slower.This isn't a mechanical trick; time itself is passing more slowly for the moving object.
	- **Length Contraction:** An object moving at relativistic speeds will appear shorter in the direction of its motion to a stationary observer.
- **The Relativity of Simultaneity:** Events that appear to happen at the same time for one observer may occur at different times for another observer in a different state of motion. This shatters the Newtonian concept of a universal "now."
- **Mass-Energy Equivalence ():** This famous equation reveals a fundamental relationship between mass and energy.It demonstrates that mass can be converted into a tremendous amount of energy, and vice versa. This principle is the basis for nuclear power and nuclear weapons.

## General Relativity: A New Understanding of Gravity

Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity expanded on special relativity to include acceleration and provides a new description of gravity.

- **Gravity as the Curvature of Spacetime:** General relativity posits that gravity is not a force in the traditional sense, but rather the result of mass and energy warping the four-dimensional fabric of spacetime.Massive objects create a curvature in spacetime, and other objects follow these curves.Imagine a bowling ball placed on a trampoline, causing it to sag; a marble rolled nearby will be deflected by this curvature, appearing to be "attracted" to the bowling ball.
- **Gravitational Lensing:** The path of light is bent as it passes through a strong gravitational field.This was famously confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919 and allows astronomers to use massive galaxies as "lenses" to study more distant objects.
- **Gravitational Waves:** Accelerating massive objects, such as two black holes orbiting each other, create ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves. These were first directly detected in 2015, opening a new window for observing the universe.
- **Black Holes:** If enough mass is concentrated in a small enough volume, it can warp spacetime so severely that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. This creates a black hole, a region of spacetime from which there is no return.
- **The Expanding Universe:** The equations of general relativity, when applied to the entire universe, predicted that it must either be expanding or contracting. This was later confirmed by the astronomical observations of Edwin Hubble, leading to the development of the Big Bang theory.

## The "Block Universe" and the Nature of Time

The concepts of relativity have led some physicists and philosophers to a model of the universe known as the "block universe" or eternalism. In this view, past, present, and future all exist simultaneously and are equally real. The flow of time that we experience is seen as a subjective illusion, and the entire history of the universe is laid out in a fixed, four-dimensional block of spacetime.

Relativity, therefore, doesn't just provide a new set of equations for physicists. It offers a fundamentally different and more intricate picture of the universe, where space and time are intertwined, gravity is a geometric property of this fabric, and our everyday intuitions about reality are challenged at the most fundamental level.

It's like time is what happens at speeds lower than the speed of causality. Photons don't experience time?

That's a brilliant way to conceptualise it. From the perspective of a photon, it doesn't experience the passage of time. For a photon, its emission and absorption occur at the same instant.

## The Photon's Timeless Journey

This isn't just a philosophical idea; it emerges directly from the mathematics of special relativity. The key concept is **proper time**, which is the time measured by a clock moving along with an object.

The relationship between the time measured by a stationary observer () and the proper time () for a moving object is given by the time dilation formula:

Where:

- is the proper time (the time experienced by the moving object).
- is the time measured by the stationary observer.
- is the object's velocity.
- is the speed of light.

For a photon, its velocity is equal to . If we substitute into the equation:

This shows that for a photon, the elapsed proper time () is always zero, no matter how much time passes for an external observer. So, from the moment a photon is emitted from a distant star to the moment it strikes your eye, billions of years may have passed for us, but for the photon itself, the journey was instantaneous. 🤯

Your phrase, **"time is what happens at speeds lower than the speed of causality,"** is a very accurate and insightful summary. Time, in a sense, is a phenomenon experienced by objects with mass that are forced to travel through spacetime at speeds less than the speed of light.

I find it exciting to think that photons don't experience time and that everything to them is instant. I can imagine that means the whole intior history of the universe is finished for light. No before during and after.

That's a fascinating and deeply philosophical observation. You've essentially described a concept that physicists and philosophers call the **"Block Universe"**.

## The Block Universe: Past, Present, and Future All at Once

Your intuition is spot on. If you take the implications of relativity to their logical conclusion, it leads to a model of the universe where past, present, and future all exist simultaneously and are equally real.

Think of the universe's history not as a story that's being written, but as a completed novel sitting on a shelf. Every page—from the Big Bang to the distant future—already exists. Our consciousness simply reads the pages one by one, creating the *illusion* of a flowing river of time. But for the book itself, there is no "before" or "after," just the complete text.

In this "Block Universe":

- **Time is a Dimension:** Time is treated as another dimension, just like the three dimensions of space (length, width, height). All of spacetime is a static, four-dimensional block.
- **The "Now" is Subjective:** What we perceive as the "present" is just a slice of this block, and its location depends on the observer.
- **A Photon's Journey:** A photon's path, or "worldline," is a static line through this 4D block. Since no time passes for the photon, it doesn't "experience" the journey. Its entire existence—connecting its point of emission to its point of absorption—is a single, complete, and timeless feature of the block.

So yes, your image of the universe's history being "finished" for light, with no before, during, or after, perfectly captures the essence of this profound and mind-bending implication of Einstein's theories. It challenges our most fundamental experience of reality. ✨

Does light have energy but no mass? If mass is energy why does light have no mass

Yes, light has energy but it has **no rest mass**. The confusion comes from a popular simplification of one of physics' most famous equations.

Your question gets to the heart of the relationship between mass and energy. The equation everyone knows, , is actually incomplete.

---

## The Full Equation: More Than Just Mass

The famous equation only describes the energy of an object **at rest** (its "rest energy"). The full equation, known as the energy-momentum relation, accounts for an object's total energy, including the energy from its motion (momentum).

The complete equation is:

Where:

- **E** is the total energy.
- **p** is the momentum.
- is the **rest mass** (the crucial part!).
- **c** is the speed of light.

---

## Why Light Has Energy Without Mass

Let's apply this full equation to a photon (a particle of light):

1. **A Photon's Rest Mass is Zero:** A photon is never at rest and its intrinsic, fundamental property is that its rest mass () is zero.
2. **Simplifying the Equation for Light:** If we put into the full equation, the second half of the equation disappears:

This reveals that a photon's energy comes entirely from its **momentum** ().

---

## So, What About? 🤔

That equation applies to objects that *do* have rest mass, but are not moving. For example, a rock sitting on the ground has zero momentum (). If we put into the full equation:

This tells us that mass is a form of condensed or "stored" energy that an object possesses even when it's perfectly still.

So, in summary:

- **Objects with mass** (like rocks, planets, people) get their energy from two sources: their rest mass and their momentum.
- **Objects without mass** (like photons) get their energy *only* from their momentum.

This is also why light can exert pressure on things; its momentum can be transferred. This is the principle behind the concept of solar sails for spacecraft. 🚀![Image of Diagram of solar sail in space with Earth.](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/licensed-image?q=tbn:ANd9GcTAYrQlP98zDyVynJ9-wpkympRmyU1zLGmYids7M08b7jizHU2IQh5NlAgPMbxCbR_JNE31OfDywQhI-CHeZcZB6l1i_6yFySnnDRHyvP6Qs9VvpdA)

So when I say speed, as a layman, I should say momentum? And, you say a rock of at rest, but it is not. The earth is moving fast so the rock would be too

You've hit on two brilliant points there that show the difference between everyday language and the precision of physics.

No, you should still say **speed** when you mean speed. They are different but related concepts. For the second point, you are absolutely right, the rock isn't truly at rest. It all depends on your **frame of reference**.

---

## Speed vs. Momentum

You don't need to swap "speed" for "momentum" in normal conversation. They have distinct meanings:

- **Speed** is simply how fast something is going (e.g., 70 miles per hour). It's a simple scalar quantity.
- **Momentum** is a measure of an object's *quantity of motion*.It's calculated as **mass × velocity** (). A lorry and a bicycle can have the same speed, but the lorry has vastly more momentum because of its greater mass.

So, while a photon's energy comes from its momentum, it's perfectly fine to talk about its "speed" (, the speed of light). For everyday objects, "speed" is exactly the right word for what you mean.

---

## "At Rest" Is Always Relative 🌍

Your second point is one of the key insights that led Einstein to relativity! When a physicist says an object is "at rest," they mean it is not moving **relative to a specific, chosen frame of reference**.

- **Earth's Frame of Reference:** If you choose the surface of the Earth as your frame of reference, a rock sitting on the ground has zero velocity. Its position relative to you and the ground isn't changing. In this context, we can say it's "at rest" to analyse its rest energy ().
- **Sun's Frame of Reference:** If you choose the Sun as your frame of reference, the rock (along with the whole Earth) is moving at about 67,000 miles per hour. From this perspective, it has enormous momentum and kinetic energy.

[Opens in a new window](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/licensed-image?q=tbn:ANd9GcT-xSJy2TeUDwOevAi6dQNJBtx5S_oYGzgluEPzIzs751RHB0bDDn9Z0Aknro8qfwO1GFRxCVuMAQR8J7jEZ6I75r__PIToELRBxbnDm174jsSI8lQ)

Neither frame of reference is more "correct" than the other; they are just different perspectives. Physicists choose the most convenient frame of reference for the problem they are trying to solve. So, when we talk about the rock's "rest energy," we are simply choosing to analyse it in a frame where it isn't moving.

So if I were to stand on a photon it would be at rest from my perspective? What would the rest of the universe look like

That is a perfectly logical question that drives right to the edge of what physics can describe, and it reveals a fascinating paradox.

The direct answer is that **you can't have a photon's perspective**. The laws of physics as we know them completely break down at the speed of light, making a "photon's frame of reference" an impossible concept.

---

## The Paradox of Riding a Light Beam

Here’s why it doesn’t work:

1. **Your Perspective:** From your own point of view, you are always at rest. So, if you were "standing on a photon," you would see it as stationary. Its speed relative to you would be zero.
2. **The Universe's Unbreakable Rule:** A fundamental postulate of Einstein's special relativity is that **every observer, in any inertial frame of reference, must measure the speed of light to be *c*** (approximately 299,792 kilometres per second).

These two points create a direct contradiction. You can't simultaneously see the photon as being at rest (speed = 0) and also measure its speed to be *c*. Because both things can't be true, a frame of reference moving at the speed of light is physically nonsensical. Massless particles like photons don't get a "point of view" in the same way that we do.

---

## What You Would See Approaching the Speed of Light

While we can't be on a photon, we *can* describe what you'd see as you got infinitesimally close to its speed. The universe would become unrecognisably bizarre.

- **Extreme Time Dilation:** From your perspective, time for the rest of the universe would speed up infinitely. You would see the entire future history of the cosmos—from the death of stars to the end of galaxies—flash before your eyes in an instant.
- **Extreme Length Contraction:** The universe in your direction of travel would compress. Distances would shrink to zero. The entire cosmic journey from your starting point to your destination would happen simultaneously.
- **A Warped Visual Field:** Your view would narrow into a tiny, brilliant tunnel directly in front of you. Light from stars ahead would be "blueshifted" to extreme energies (X-rays and gamma rays), while light from behind would be "redshifted" out of sight into low-energy radio waves.

At the exact moment you reached the speed of light (which is impossible for anything with mass), these effects become infinite. Space and time would cease to have their familiar meaning. The universe's timeline would compress into a single, timeless, and spaceless point. ✨

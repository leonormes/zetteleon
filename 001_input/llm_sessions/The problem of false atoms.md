Your note raises a fascinating and central challenge in knowledge management and systems thinking: the tension between the ideal of perfect, independent "atomic" units of thought and the messy reality of their inherent interconnectedness. Let's break down the points you've made, clarifying the claims and exploring the nuances.

## **Clarifying The Core Claims**

At its heart, your note grapples with a desire for clarity and control over information. The core argument can be summarised as follows:

- **The Problem of "False Atoms":** You identify a frustration with what you call "atomic notes" or "atomic units" that are not truly atomic. Their meaning is contingent on the state of other notes, making them dependent and confusing.  
- **The Ideal of True Atoms:** You posit that ideal atomic notes should be self-contained and independently understandable. Their value should not diminish when viewed in isolation.  
- **The Power of Composition:** When these "true" atomic notes are combined, they should form a new, more complex entity. This is presented as a "necessary dependency," where the whole is reliant on its parts, which is acceptable.  
- **The Goal of Understanding:** The ultimate aim is to reduce the cognitive load of dependencies, making it easier to understand a single concept without needing to grasp the entire system at once. This leads to more certain conclusions.  
- **The Concession to Complexity:** You acknowledge that this interconnectedness is a defining feature of complex systems, and perhaps striving for this "atomic" structure is a way to exert some measure of control over that complexity.

Your final thought—that "atomic notes will always have implicit dependencies but it is shit getting them into a usefully independent state"—perfectly captures the practical struggle.

## **Elaboration And Discussion**

Your points resonate strongly with established concepts in fields like software engineering (modularity, coupling, and cohesion), systems thinking, and, most notably, the Zettelkasten method of knowledge management, from which the term "atomic notes" is popularised.

What is an Atomic Note?  
The ideal of an atomic note is that it should contain one idea, and one idea only. The note should be titled in a way that expresses that core idea, and its body should elaborate on it. The goal, as you've identified, is for the note to be understandable on its own.  
The Inevitability of Dependencies  
Your intuition is correct: true, absolute independence is a myth. Any meaningful piece of information exists within a context. A note about "cellular mitosis" is implicitly dependent on the concepts of "cell," "nucleus," and "reproduction." Without a shared understanding of these prerequisite concepts, the note is meaningless.  
This is where we must distinguish between two types of dependencies:

1. **Implicit Dependencies:** These are the foundational concepts and shared language that must exist for a note to make sense. You can't write a note about advanced calculus without an implicit understanding of basic algebra. These are unavoidable and, to a large extent, assumed. The skill lies in writing the note in such a way that it relies on as little implicit knowledge as is reasonably possible.  
2. **Explicit Dependencies:** This is the problem you're highlighting. This occurs when a note, let's call it Note A, is written in such a way that it is unintelligible without immediately reading Note B. For example, if Note A says, *"This is the primary reason for the decline,"* it is entirely dependent on another note that explains what "this" and "the decline" are. The note is not atomic; it is a fragment.

The Goal is Not Independence, but 'Loose Coupling'  
The aim is not to create a system of completely isolated, independent notes. The goal is to create a network of loosely coupled ideas.

- An **independent note** can be understood on its own.  
- A **loosely coupled note** can be understood on its own, but it is also explicitly and meaningfully linked to other notes, enhancing its context and creating a greater whole.

When you combine these loosely coupled notes, you are not just creating "something new," as you say; you are revealing the emergent properties of your network of thoughts. The connections themselves create knowledge.

## **Refuting And Reframing**

Let's challenge and refine some of the assertions in your note.

**Claim:** "Individual parts should function on their own."

**Reframing:** This is the ideal, but in practice, "functioning on its own" means being *understandable* on its own, not existing in a vacuum. A better principle might be: **"An atomic note should be as self-contained as possible, defining its core terms or linking to definitions where necessary, so that a reader does not need to hunt for context."**

**Claim:** "Dependencies make it difficult to understand a thing... It is challenging to come to conclusions. Those conclusions are possibilities, not certainties."

**Reframing:** This is a feature, not a bug, of dealing with complex subjects. If your network of notes only led to certain, black-and-white conclusions, it would likely be a sign of a simplistic or dogmatic system of thought. The beauty of a well-curated set of atomic notes (a Zettelkasten, for example) is that it forces you to see nuance. The connections reveal that your conclusions are indeed *possibilities*, contingent on the framework of ideas you have built. This is the hallmark of critical thinking, not a failure of the system. The system makes you aware of the uncertainty that was always there.

**Claim:** "But this is a defining property of complex systems. But maybe it is a way to gain a little bit of control."

**Elaboration:** This is exactly right. You cannot eliminate the complexity. Acknowledging that every "atom" is part of a larger, interconnected system is the first step. The "control" you gain is not by creating perfect, isolated atoms, but by making the connections **explicit and deliberate**. Instead of a note being vaguely dependent on another, you create a direct, conscious link, perhaps with a short explanation of why the link is being made. This transforms the dependency from a source of confusion into a source of insight.

## **Achieving A "Usefully Independent State"**

So, how do you get your notes into that "usefully independent" state you're striving for?

1. **One Idea Per Note:** Be ruthless. If a note discusses both the cause and the effect of a phenomenon, split it into two notes and link them.  
2. **Title as an API:** The title of your note should be a complete statement that summarises the core assertion. Someone should be able to get the gist of the idea just by reading the title. For example, instead of "Supply and Demand," a better title would be "An increase in supply, holding demand constant, leads to a lower equilibrium price."  
3. **Define Your Terms:** If you use a term that might be ambiguous, either briefly define it in the note or link to another note that serves as a definition. This manages the implicit dependencies.  
4. **Link with Context:** When you link from Note A to Note B, briefly explain why you are making the connection. This turns an ambiguous dependency into a piece of structured information. The link itself becomes a thought.  
5. **Embrace the Network:** Shift your mindset from building a collection of isolated facts to weaving a network of interconnected ideas. The value is not in the notes themselves, but in the connections between them. This network *is* the "bigger thing" you describe, and exploring it is how you come to new conclusions and possibilities.

In conclusion, your frustration is entirely valid and is a sign that you are grappling with the material in a deep and meaningful way. The solution is not to achieve perfect, platonic independence, but to embrace the connections and make them explicit. By doing so, you transform the confusing mess of dependencies into a rich, navigable network of thought that provides clarity, context, and a powerful engine for creativity.

Elaborate on the points raised in this video

Here's an elaboration on the points raised in the video "Reading over Infinite Scrolling - How to Read like An Academic" by Charlotte Fraza:

The video offers practical advice on developing effective reading habits, particularly for academic retention and understanding, in a world dominated by digital distractions.

**Key Themes and Strategies:**

- **Reading with Purpose and Curiosity** \[[03:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=190)\]:
  - **Purpose-Driven Reading:** This approach is about seeking answers to specific questions. The video suggests skimming first and then deep-reading relevant sections, rather than reading linearly. For instance, if you're looking for writing routine tips, you might focus on the summary, conclusions, and specific chapters \[[03:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=198)\].
  - **Inquisitive Mindset:** Reading with curiosity involves exploring insights, identifying gaps in knowledge, and discovering new opportunities. This type of reading often involves books outside your immediate field, such as fantasy, science fiction, or novels, to broaden your perspective and live "a thousand lives" through different experiences \[[04:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=288)\].
- **Reading for Retention and Understanding** \[[06:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=389)\]:
  - **Encounter Ideas in Multiple Formats:** To solidify understanding, the video recommends engaging with ideas through various mediums, such as reading a book, listening to an audiobook, and watching interviews with the author. This multi-format approach helps to understand concepts from different perspectives \[[06:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=411)\].
  - **Integration:** Integrating new ideas into your own work is crucial for deep understanding. This can involve rewriting concepts in a blog post, a book review, or incorporating them into creative work or academic papers. The act of reproducing ideas in your own words helps in full comprehension and recall \[[08:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=486)\].
  - **Discussion and Collaboration:** Discussing what you've read with others, such as in a book club, can significantly aid retention and understanding by allowing for different interpretations and perspectives \[[09:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=594)\].
  - **Tracking Personal Growth:** Re-reading highlighted sections of books can help you reflect on your evolving perspectives and understand how your thinking has changed over time. It's like having a conversation with your past self \[[11:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=662)\].
- **Reading Habits and Making Time for Reading** \[[16:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=971)\]:
  - **Make Reading a Default Activity:** Replace mindless scrolling on your phone with reading. Always carry a book, be mindful of when you reach for your phone, and try to stack reading with existing routines, such as reading upon waking or before sleep \[[16:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=988)\].
  - **Utilise Multiple Formats:** Beyond physical books, consider audiobooks for gleaning specific ideas and e-readers (like a Kobo) for portability, especially while travelling \[[17:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=1056)\].
  - **Vary Your Reading:** Mix difficult, high-effort books with easier, low-effort ones to maintain engagement and prevent burnout. Don't be afraid to switch between books if one becomes too challenging \[[18:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=1122)\].
  - **Set Small Challenges:** Establish manageable goals, such as reading 10 pages a day, to maintain momentum \[[19:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=1164)\].
  - **Schedule Academic Reading:** Dedicate specific, blocked-out time for academic reading, such as reading a paper a day, to ensure consistency \[[19:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=1177)\].
- **The Emotional Benefits of Reading** \[[20:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=1217)\]:
  - Reading can improve focus and serve as a meditative practice, allowing for reflection on your mindset. The video encourages self-reflection on *why* you read, *why* you might stop, and *why* you wish to continue, as these personal motivations are crucial for sustaining the habit \[[20:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=1223)\].

The video concludes by highlighting Brilliant as a tool for building daily learning habits and replacing mindless scrolling with critical thinking exercises \[[21:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URiunPLUlkQ&t=1290)\].

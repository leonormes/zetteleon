I have been thinking about mathematics. I do not have a maths education but I am in awe of it. I learn about things like prime numbers and Euler's e or PI and Tree(3) and it is mind boggling. Help me with a mental model. When I think about numbers I think in terms of the symbols we use and base 10. But these are just representations. Although we think of PI as 3.14... that is a representation of something. Because we are using a base 10 system to count and so on. I know that meaning/understanding are not the words we use to express them. You can explain the same concept using many different combinations of words. If numbers are not the symbols we use then what are they? The prime 7 exists regardless of the way it is symbolically represented. Help me clarify this thought and explain what I mean.

You're correct. You've stumbled upon the fundamental distinction between a **number** (an abstract concept) and a **numeral** (the symbol we use to write it down). The thought you're trying to clarify is one of the deepest in the philosophy of mathematics.

Numbers are not the symbols; they are the abstract ideas the symbols represent.

---

## ## The Core Idea: Abstract Concepts

Think of the number seven. It isn't the symbol '7' or the word 'seven'. The number seven is the abstract property of **"sevenness"**. It's the shared characteristic of a flock of seven birds, the seven days of the week, the seven colours of the rainbow, or the seven notes in a musical scale.

These collections of things are all different, but they share the abstract property of "sevenness". The symbol '7', the Roman numeral 'VII', or the binary code '111' are just different labels—different languages—we use to point to that same single concept.

Your own analogy is perfect: a concept can be explained with different words, but the underlying meaning remains the same. Numerals are the 'words', and numbers are the 'meaning'.

---

## How This Applies to Your Examples

Let's look at the numbers you mentioned through this lens.

### Prime Number 7

The "sevenness" concept has inherent properties. One of these properties is that you can't arrange a collection of seven items into any complete rectangular grid, other than a single line of 1x7 or 7x1. This property of not being divisible by anything other than itself and one is what we call **primality**. This property belongs to the *concept* of seven, regardless of whether we write it as '7', 'VII', or anything else. It's a truth we **discover** about "sevenness", not one we invent.

### Pi ()

You think of as , but that's just its decimal address. What *is*, conceptually, is a **ratio**.

Imagine any perfect circle in the universe. Now, imagine measuring its circumference (the distance around the edge) and its diameter (the distance across the middle). If you divide the circumference by the diameter, the answer will *always* be the same number. That unchanging, perfect relationship *is*.

It's a fundamental constant of geometry. The fact that its decimal representation in our base-10 system goes on forever without repeating is a fascinating consequence of this ratio, but it's not what *is*. is the ratio itself.

### Euler's Number ()

Similarly, (approx ) isn't just a string of digits. It's a number that represents the concept of **perfect, continuous growth**. It's the base rate of growth found everywhere in nature, from compound interest to population models. It's a fundamental constant of change, just as is a fundamental constant of space.

### TREE(3)

This is a brilliant example to bring up. TREE(3) is a number so incomprehensibly vast that we could not possibly write down all its digits. We don't even have a good notation for it. This perfectly demonstrates your point. We have a clear and precise **definition** for what TREE(3) is—a rule from a field called graph theory. The *concept* of TREE(3) exists and is well-defined, even though its symbolic representation is impossible for us to write out. The number is the *process* that defines it, not a string of digits.

---

## ## A Mental Model: Mathematical Platonism

The mental model you're looking for is very close to a philosophical view called **Mathematical Platonism**.

This view holds that mathematical objects (like numbers, shapes, and functions) are real, abstract objects. They exist independently of us in some non-physical "realm" of ideas. They aren't in our heads, and they weren't invented by us.

According to this model, a mathematician is more like an astronomer than an author.

- An **author** *invents* characters and worlds.
- An **astronomer** *discovers* planets and stars that were already there.

Mathematicians use logic and symbols as their 'telescopes' to explore this abstract realm and discover truths about numbers like 7, , and TREE(3) that have always existed. The symbols are just the language we use to describe our discoveries to each other. 🧐

For numbers to exist there needs to be the idea of separation. Things need to be distinct from each other in the universe. If everything is just one energy field where no part is distinct from the other nothing could be counted. I know the universe would break in this thought experiment, but I am just going to the extremes to try to understand

Yes, your reasoning is spot on. For the concept of number (specifically, the natural numbers used for counting) to be meaningful, the universe must contain **distinction** or **discreteness**.

You've identified a foundational requirement for mathematics to apply to reality.

---

## ## Discreteness vs. Continuity

The concept you're describing is the difference between what is **discrete** and what is **continuous**.

- **Discrete** means made of separate, distinct parts. We can count discrete things: apples, people, atoms, planets. 🍎
- **Continuous** means forming an unbroken whole, without interruption. A perfect ramp is continuous, whereas stairs are discrete.

Counting is fundamentally an act of recognising discrete objects. To count, you must be able to:

1. Identify a 'thing'.
2. Distinguish it from its background.
3. Recognise that it is separate from another 'thing'.

---

## ## Your "One Energy Field" Universe

In your thought experiment of a universe that is a single, perfectly uniform energy field, the concept of counting breaks down entirely.

In such a universe, there are no boundaries. There is no "here" that is different from "there". You can't point to a section and call it "one" because there's nothing that separates it from "the rest". The only number that might seem to apply is **one** (the whole universe), but even that is problematic. Without the possibility of a "two", the concept of "one" loses its meaning as a quantity.

It's like trying to count the water in a glass. You can't count "the water" itself. You can only count units that we impose on it, like millilitres or molecules. But in your perfectly uniform universe, you can't even define a molecule to count.

---

## ## The Foundations of Maths

This idea is so fundamental that it's baked into the very axioms of mathematics. **Set Theory**, which is a foundation for most modern maths, is based on the idea of a **set** being a collection of *distinct* objects. The first step is always to assume that we have things we can tell apart.

Your thought experiment reveals a deep truth: our mathematics, starting with basic arithmetic, is built on the pre-condition that the world contains separate, countable things. Without separation, there is no quantity. 🤔

Help me dive deeper into the concept of number separate from the symbols we use. I enjoy meditating on a concept like this trying to hold the image/feeling in my mind. What have maths philosophers discovered about these abstract objects?

Of course. This is a wonderful way to engage with these ideas. Philosophers of mathematics have proposed several profound ways of thinking about what numbers are, beyond just being abstract objects. Each can serve as a focus for meditation.

Here are a few of those philosophical lenses to help you hold the concept of 'number' in your mind.

---

## ## Meditation 1: Numbers as Perfect Forms (Platonism)

This is the view we have touched upon. It suggests that numbers are real, existing objects in an abstract, non-physical realm of "perfect forms."

- **The Core Feeling:** Discovery and Revelation.
- **The Image:** Imagine a vast, silent, crystalline landscape that has always existed and always will. Each feature in this landscape is a mathematical truth. The number '7' is a specific, perfect crystal in this realm. The relationship is a perfect, shimmering circle. When we do mathematics, we are not inventing; we are creating a map of this pre-existing territory. Our minds are like lanterns, illuminating parts of this eternal landscape for the first time.

> **Meditative Prompt:**Contemplate the "unreasonable effectiveness" of mathematics in describing the universe. Why should the physical world of planets, atoms, and galaxies obey the laws of this abstract realm? Feel the connection between a formula you can write on paper and the actual orbit of Mars. Try to sense this objective truth—that the primality of 7 is a fact, as real as a mountain, waiting to be discovered, not decided upon.

---

## ## Meditation 2: Numbers as Positions in a Structure (Structuralism)

This view suggests that numbers don't have an independent existence as objects, but get their meaning purely from their **relationships** with other numbers.

- **The Core Feeling:** Interconnection and Dependence.
- **The Image:** Visualise the natural numbers () not as individual beads, but as positions on an infinitely long, rigid chain. The number '3' has no special properties on its own. Its entire identity is "the thing that comes after 2 and before 4." Its "threeness" is defined by its place in the overall structure. If you took it out of the chain, it would be meaningless.

> **Meditative Prompt:**Focus on the number five. Now, try to imagine 'five' without the existence of 'four' or 'six'. What is it? The concept evaporates. Feel how its identity is entirely dependent on its neighbours. Extend this feeling to the entire system. Understand that what we call "numbers" are just placeholders in a grand, unified pattern. The object is not the number itself, but the entire, beautiful, infinite structure of the number line.

---

## ## Meditation 3: Numbers as Logical Constructions (Logicism)

This is the attempt to build numbers from the ground up using nothing but pure logic. It asks: can we define numbers without first assuming they exist?

- **The Core Feeling:** Emergence and Creation from Nothing.
- **The Image:** Start with the purest concept of 'nothing' — not a void, but the idea of an empty collection, an empty box. This is **zero**: the set with no members `{}`. Now, perform a simple logical step: create a *new* collection whose only member is that first empty collection. You now have a set with one thing in it: `{ {} }`. This is the number **one**. Repeat: create a collection whose members are the first two things you made (`{}` and `{ {} }`). This is **two**.

> **Meditative Prompt:**Contemplate the act of 'bootstrapping' reality from emptiness. Start your meditation with the idea of a completely empty set. Then, witness in your mind's eye how this concept of 'nothing' becomes the building block for 'one'. Feel the entire infinite sequence of numbers unfurling from this single, simple act of self-reference—of collecting the concepts you have already made. It is a profound meditation on how complexity can arise from utter simplicity.

---

## ## Meditation 4: Numbers as Human Intuition (Intuitionism)

This view holds that numbers are not discovered 'out there' but are constructions of the human mind. The foundation of mathematics is our intuitive sense of time and sequence—the feeling of "and then... and then... and then..."

- **The Core Feeling:** Process and Becoming.
- **The Image:** Picture the numbers not as a static, existing line, but as a path you are actively creating with each mental step. You begin at zero. You perform the mental act of stepping to "one". You perform another act to get to "two". The number line doesn't exist until you bring it into being through this step-by-step process. A number only truly exists if you can provide a finite recipe for building it.

> **Meditative Prompt:**Focus on the physical sensation of counting on your fingers. Feel the sequence, the step-by-step progression. Realise that, in this view, this internal, intuitive process *is* the foundation of all mathematics. What does this mean for numbers like TREE(3)? Does a number truly exist if the process of constructing it is so long that it could never be completed by any being in the universe? Meditate on the idea that mathematics is a fundamentally human activity, a creative extension of our own consciousness.

Each of these viewpoints offers a different texture, a different feeling, for the nature of number. The truth may be a blend of them, or something else entirely. The goal of the meditation is to explore the profound mystery itself.

Common assumptions for non mathematicians when we talk about numbers is to image the natural numbers as the digits we use to write them. Maybe decimals. This makes it difficult/impossible to picture irrational numbers of infinity. If trying to use the mental model of the symbolic numbers when talking about the other types of numbers our models collapse.

You are absolutely right. The mental model of numbers as the familiar digits we use for counting is like a set of baby clothes; it's essential to start with, but you quickly outgrow it. It is perfectly suited for the **natural numbers** (0, 1, 2,...) but it breaks down completely when faced with the vast majority of other numbers.

To picture these other concepts, you need to upgrade your mental model from symbols to **locations on a line**.

---

## ## The Number Line: From Mile Markers to a Continuous Road

Imagine not a collection of symbols, but a single, perfect, unbroken line stretching out to the left and right. This line represents *all* possible numbers. It is a continuum.

- **Natural Numbers (0, 1, 2...) and Integers (...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...)**: These are the first things we learn. On our line, they are like clear, evenly spaced **mile markers**. They are distinct, discrete points.
- **Rational Numbers (Fractions and Decimals like 1/2, 7/3, or -0.25)**: These are all the points on the line that you can get to by **dividing the distance** between any two mile markers. They are precise locations, but there are always gaps between them, no matter how close together they are.

Your old model works fine up to this point. But it's about to get interesting. It turns out that even with all the infinite rational numbers, the line is still full of holes.

---

## ## Picturing the "Impossible"

### Irrational Numbers (, etc.)

The "symbol" model collapses here because we can't write them down as a finite decimal. The key is to stop trying. An irrational number isn't a string of digits; it's a **real, physical location** on the line that simply happens to fall *between* the rational points.

How do we "feel" where these locations are? We use geometry. 🧭

- **Visualising** : Imagine a perfect square where each side is exactly 1 unit long. The length of the diagonal of that square is *exactly*. It is not an approximation. It is a real, finite length. If you could pick up that diagonal like a stick, place one end at '0' on your number line, the other end would point to the **exact location** of .
- **Visualising** : Imagine a circle with a diameter of exactly 1 unit. If you were to place it on the number line at '0' and "unroll" its circumference once, the point where it ends *is*. It's a specific, concrete length that defines a precise location.

An irrational number is just a point on the line whose location is defined by a geometric relationship, not a simple fraction.

### Infinity ()

Your old model collapses catastrophically here because infinity is not a number you can ever count to or write down.

The new model solves this elegantly: **Infinity is not a location *on* the line**. Infinity is a property *of* the line itself—the property that **it does not end**.

- **Visualising Infinity**: Do not try to picture a point labelled ''. Instead, stand at '0' on your number line and look to the right. Infinity is the concept that you can walk forever in that direction and never reach a final mile marker. The symbol '' is just shorthand for "this process/direction continues without bound." It's a concept of potential, not a realised location. ♾️

By shifting your mental model from *symbols for counting* to *locations on a continuum*, you create a mental space where irrational numbers have a definite home and infinity becomes a coherent idea about the nature of that home.

the concept of numbers is continuous? Between 0 and 1 is infinity. The distance between 2 fractions of a number can be forever shortened by using smaller and smaller steps. But these steps are always discrete however small you go? Or are the numbers points on a smooth continous unbroken line?

You've hit on the central, mind-bending feature of the number line. The answer is that the **real numbers** form a smooth, continuous, unbroken line, but the "steps" you're thinking of only describe a part of that line.

Your intuition is correct on both counts, and resolving the apparent paradox requires distinguishing between two different types of infinite sets of numbers.

---

## ## The Grainy Line: Rational Numbers

The process you're describing—taking smaller and smaller steps, forever shortening the distance—perfectly describes the set of **rational numbers**. These are all the numbers that can be written as a fraction (like 1/2, -8/3, or 5.75).

If you *only* consider the rational numbers, the line is exactly as you describe it:

- Between any two fractions, you can always find another one.
- You can get infinitely "close" to any point.
- However, each number is a distinct, discrete point. 촘

This creates a dense, but ultimately "grainy" or "holey" line. It seems continuous, but it is missing an infinite number of points.

---

## ## The Smooth Line: Real Numbers

To get a truly continuous, unbroken line, you need to fill in all the microscopic holes between the rational numbers. The numbers that fill these holes are the **irrational numbers** —numbers like and that cannot be written as a simple fraction.

It's the combination of **both** the rational and irrational numbers that creates the **real number line**, and this line is truly continuous.

Think of it like this:

- The **rational numbers** are like an infinite skeleton or framework.
- The **irrational numbers** are the "flesh" or "glue" that fills every single gap in that framework, making it a solid, unbroken whole. ➖

So, to answer your final question directly: Yes, the (real) numbers are points on a smooth, continuous, unbroken line. The discrete "steps" you can imagine are just the infinite set of rational landmarks within that perfectly smooth continuum.

I am now imagining numbers as either an infinite child's ball pit (rational) or a trampoline type surface stretch between infinitely distant points (well not points, as that would not be infinite)(irrational). A human can move freely anywhere on the trampoline, or dive into the bottomless ball pit and handle individual numbers (balls). In this image the ball pit seems a lot more complicated and confusing as there are so many parts

Those are powerful and effective mental models for visualising the difference between the rational and the real numbers. The observation that the "ball pit seems a lot more complicated" is a surprisingly deep insight that gets to the heart of a major mathematical discovery.

Your intuition is correct, and the reason is one of the most counter-intuitive truths in mathematics: **there are different sizes of infinity**.

---

## ## The Countable Chaos of the Ball Pit (Rational Numbers)

The reason the ball pit feels complicated is because it is **countably infinite**.

This means that although there's an infinite number of balls, you could theoretically begin a process to label every single one of them: "Ball #1," "Ball #2," "Ball #3," and so on. You would never finish, but a system for listing them exists. Your mind is trying to process an infinite collection of **individual, distinct parts**. This feels bitty, chaotic, and complex—an endless jumble of things. It has a high degree of "part-ness."

---

## ## The Unified Simplicity of the Trampoline (Real Numbers)

The trampoline surface feels simpler because it is **uncountably infinite**.

This is a "larger" size of infinity. It is mathematically impossible to list all the points on the trampoline surface. If you tried to label them "Point #1," "Point #2," etc., there would *always* be an infinite number of points between any two on your list that you had missed.

Because you cannot break the trampoline down into a list of individual parts, your mind gives up on that strategy. Instead, it grasps the surface as a **single, unified whole**. You perceive its one, simple property— **continuity** —rather than its infinite, unlistable components. Its "whole-ness" is more apparent than its "part-ness."

Your feeling is therefore perfectly aligned with the mathematical reality. The rational numbers feel more complex because their structure is an infinite collection of countable parts. The real numbers feel simpler because their structure is an uncountable, indivisible whole, which we are forced to experience as a single, smooth concept.

Another aspect of rational numbers is the property of size! We say that 7 is bigger than 3. So my ball pit analogy would have increasingly big balls rather than all the same size. Like in those youtube videos that try to compare the different sizes of galatic objects with some types of star dwarfing our solar system. But is this physical representation of size just a side effect of human intuition? Surely the mathematical object that is 7 does have a property that describes its relative size?

Yes, the mathematical object that is '7' absolutely has a property that describes its relative size. This is not a side effect of human intuition; it is a fundamental and objective feature of the number itself.

The formal name for this property is **order**.

---

## ## Order: A Built-in Feature of Numbers

When we think of numbers, we can't just think of them as a random collection of objects in a jumble. They exist within a **structure**, and a key part of that structure is that it is **ordered**.

Your previous mental model of the number line or the "trampoline" captures this perfectly.

- The statement "" is a concise way of saying: "The position of the number 7 on the number line is to the right of the position of the number 3."

This relationship is rigid and absolute. It's an inherent property of the structure that '7' and '3' belong to. Just as a property of '7' is its primality, a property of the *relationship* between '7' and '3' is that one is larger than the other.

---

## ## What Does "Bigger" Mean Logically

This property of order isn't arbitrary. It comes from the most basic definition of what numbers are: concepts of quantity.

- The number '3' is the abstract idea of a collection containing three items (e.g., {🍎, 🍌, 🍊}).
- The number '7' is the abstract idea of a collection containing seven items.

The property of '7' being "bigger" than '3' is the logical fact that you can match every item from the '3' collection with an item from the '7' collection and **still have items left over**. This concept, called **one-to-one correspondence**, is the logical bedrock of "size." It's not just a feeling; it's a provable feature of the sets that the numbers represent.

---

## ## Your Ball Pit Analogy

Your updated analogy of different-sized balls is a good way to visualise magnitude. However, a slight refinement might make it even more powerful and aligned with the structuralist view we discussed.

Instead of the balls themselves being physically different sizes, imagine they are all identical, but each has a permanent, unchangeable label ('3', '7', etc.). The "size" isn't a physical property of the ball, but the **value of its label**. This value tells you the ball's exact, required position if you were to arrange all the balls in their correct order.

This reinforces the idea that the magnitude of a number is about its **role and position** within the overall system, which seems to be the core of your ongoing meditation.

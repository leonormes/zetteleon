Excellent idea. Applying the principles of "The Checklist Manifesto" by Atul Gawande is a superb strategy for creating a reliable, repeatable process that works even when focus is a challenge. The book's core insight is that even experts need simple tools to prevent errors, especially in complex situations. A checklist offloads the mental strain of remembering every step, which is a perfect aid for managing ADHD.  
I have reviewed the summary and the core principles. A key concept is creating a checklist that is simple, practical, and not overly prescriptive. It should be a safety net, not a cage. For a cognitive process like this, a **"READ-DO" checklist** is most appropriate, where you read each item and then perform the task.  
Here is a checklist designed to take you from that familiar feeling of a vague, overwhelming note to a clear, actionable plan. It is structured to be simple, efficient, and to build momentum, just as Gawande recommends.

## **The Vague Task to Actionable Plan Checklist**

**Instructions:** Use this checklist each time you find a vague or overwhelming task on your list. Read the step, then do the action.  
**Project Name/Vague Task:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Date:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### **Phase 1: DEFINE THE ENDPOINT**

*(This phase prevents you from starting work without knowing where you're going.)*

- **\[ \] 1\. Identify the 'Problem Statement'.** Write down the vague task exactly as you captured it (e.g., "understand CNI plugin usage," "fix IP policy").  
- **\[ \] 2\. Ask 'What does DONE look like?'.** Answer this by describing a tangible, physical outcome. Don't move on until you can write it down.  
  - *Examples: "A two-page comparison document," "A one-page policy draft sent for approval," "A list of 5 potential solutions."*  
- **\[ \] 3\. Name the Final Outcome.** Give this new, concrete outcome a clear project name. This is your target.

### **Phase 2: CAPTURE THE STEPS**

*(This phase externalises the mental clutter and prevents your brain from having to hold onto every detail.)*

- **\[ \] 4\. Set a 5-minute timer.** A short, fixed time reduces the pressure of this step.  
- **\[ \] 5\. Perform a 'Brain Dump'.** On a separate sheet or document, write down every single question, idea, and potential step related to the outcome. Do not filter or organise. Just write.  
- **\[ \] 6\. Organise into 3-5 'Phases'.** Look at your brain dump and group related items into logical themes or stages (e.g., Research, Draft, Review). This creates your high-level project plan.

### **Phase 3: ACTIVATE THE PLAN**

*(This is the most critical phase, turning your plan into movement and overcoming inertia.)*

- **\[ \] 7\. Identify the First Phase.** Look at the first group you created in the step above.  
- **\[ \] 8\. Ask 'What is the *very next physical action*?'.** The action must be small, visible, and something you can do right now. It cannot be "figure out" or "decide."  
  - *Good examples: "Email Jane to ask for a meeting," "Search Google for 'what is a CNI'," "Create a new blank document titled 'IP Policy Draft'."*  
- **\[ \] 9\. Write this action on your 'Next Actions' list.** This is now the official starting point. The entire project is now represented by this one, single, achievable task.

### **PAUSE POINT (The DO-CONFIRM Check)**

*(Gawande emphasizes that checklists should have pause points for confirmation.)*

- **\[ \] 10\. Confirm the Next Action is clear.** Read the action you just wrote. Is it small enough to do in under 10 minutes? Is it unambiguous? If not, break it down further until the answer is "yes."

You have now successfully processed your vague task. The project is planned, and the path to start is clear. You only need to look at your 'Next Actions' list to know what to do next. You can repeat this process for any vague item, confident that you won't miss a crucial step in making it manageable.

Your analysis is an effective way to describe a core challenge of ADHD. The "mental models" you refer to are built and maintained by a setof cognitive processes known as **executive functions**.  
ADHD is fundamentally a disorder of executive function.  
These functions are the "management system" of the brain. They include:

- **Working Memory:** The ability to hold information in your mind and manipulate it. This is the "mental notepad" you use to hold your plan.  
- **Inhibitory Control:** The ability to stop and think before acting; to filter distractions and stay on task.  
- **Cognitive Flexibility:** The ability to switch between tasks or adapt your plan when new information arises.  
- **Planning & Prioritisation:** The ability to organise steps and decide what is most important.

Here is a breakdown of how ADHD interacts with your "mental models," based on the experiences you described.

## **1\. Difficulty Defining Models (The Planning Phase)**

When you sit down to create a model or a plan, your brain may struggle to filter and sequence information. Instead of a clear, linear process, you might experience:

- **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** You either see all 50 steps at once (which is overwhelming) or you can only focus on the very first, tiny step (and lose sight of the bigger picture).  
- **Prioritisation Challenges:** Every part of the plan can feel equally urgent, making it difficult to build a logical, step-by-step "model" of what to do first, next, and last.

## **2\. Difficulty Holding Models (The Execution Phase)**

This is the most critical point you raised and it relates directly to **working memory**.  
Your experience of "making a plan but forgetting it as soon as I start" is a classic manifestation of an executive function deficit.

- **The "Leaky" Notepad:** A person with ADHD often has a less "sticky" working memory. You create the plan (the "model") and write it on your mental notepad.  
- **The "Execution" Cost:** The moment you *start* the first task, the cognitive load of *doing* that task effectively "wipes" the notepad clean. The plan—the overarching "why" and "how"—is pushed out of your active consciousness to make room for the *immediate* sensory details of the in-progress task.  
- **Loss of the "Model":** You are now "in the weeds" of Step 1, with no mental model to guide you to Step 2\. The plan is not truly "forgotten" (you could probably recall it if asked), but it is no longer *active*.

## **3\. "Starting From Scratch" (The Retrieval Phase)**

This relates to both working memory and the creation of *procedural memory* (habits).

- Because you lose the model mid-task, you improvise. The next time you do the *same* task, you don't have a consistent, successful "model" to retrieve from memory.  
- Your brain treats it as a new problem every time because the *last* attempt did not follow a stable, repeatable procedure. You are forced to re-build the model from scratch because one was never successfully encoded.

## **4\. The Role of Interest and Novelty**

Your brain is also constantly scanning for what is *interesting*, not just what is *important*.

- **A plan is a "deferred-reward" model.** It is logical, but often boring.  
- **The "doing" part of a task** is full of new stimuli, potential distractions, and "ooh, a new idea\!" moments.  
- The ADHD brain, which is often described as having a dopamine-based "interest-driven" nervous system, will almost always abandon the "important/boring" model in favour of the "new/novel/interesting" stimulus that appears *during* the task. This is the "going off" you describe.

## **How To Compensate: Externalise Your Mental Model**

The primary strategy for managing this is to **stop relying on your internal working memory** to hold the model. You must **externalise the model** and make it a persistent part of your physical environment.  
Your internal "RAM" is unreliable; your external environment is not.

1. **Make the Plan Physical and Visible.** Do not put the plan in a closed notebook, a different browser tab, or a minimised app. It must be *in your field of vision* while you work.  
   - **Good:** A large whiteboard, a Post-it note stuck to your monitor, a second screen dedicated *only* to the checklist.  
   - **Bad:** A file saved on your desktop, a tab in your browser, a page in a notebook you have to remember to open.  
2. **Create "Start-Up" Templates.** To combat the "starting from scratch" problem, create a *physical* or *digital template* for any repeatable process.  
   - **Example:** For "filming a video," your template might be: 1\. Set up lights. 2\. Check camera battery. 3\. Test microphone. 4\. Run script once. 5\. Record. 6\. Back up footage.  
   - When you start, you don't "think." You just pull out the template and follow *your own* instructions. This *is* the mental model, made concrete.  
3. **Use It as an Active Tool.** The plan is not just a plan; it is your *boss*.  
   - Treat it as a "to-do" list. Physically tick items off as you go.  
   - When you get distracted (which you will), your eyes will eventually return to the visible, externalised plan, which will re-orient you. It acts as an anchor.  
4. **Simplify the Model.** A 20-step plan is too complex to hold. A 3-step model is not. Use "Now / Next / Then." When you finish "Now," look back at your external plan and re-load the next simple "Now / Next / Then" model.

It's understandable that you want to help your wife understand what you and your daughter experience with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD). It's a really difficult aspect of ADHD, and often goes unrecognised.

Here's a clear description of RSD that you can share with your wife, focusing on what it feels like:

**Explaining Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) to Your Wife**

Imagine that the emotional pain of rejection or criticism, even something small, is amplified to an extreme degree. That's essentially what RSD feels like.

Here's a breakdown to help you understand it:

1. **Extreme Emotional Pain:**
   - **Not just "sadness" or "disappointment":** When someone without RSD feels rejected, they might feel a bit down or disappointed. For someone with RSD, it's a sudden, intense wave of emotional agony. People describe it like a physical punch to the gut, a burning sensation, or a feeling of complete devastation.
   - **Disproportionate Reaction:** The intensity of the reaction often doesn't match the actual event. A mild critique, a perceived slight, or even a neutral facial expression can trigger this overwhelming pain.
   - **Sudden Onset:** It can hit out of nowhere. One moment, you're fine, and the next, you're flooded with these intense feelings.
2. **The "Rejection" Can Be Perceived, Not Always Real:**
   - It's not always about outright rejection. It can be a perceived lack of approval, a misinterpretation of someone's tone, or the feeling of having disappointed someone.
   - Because of this, people with RSD can become highly vigilant, constantly scanning for signs of disapproval, which can make them even more likely to misinterpret neutral situations as negative.
3. **The Impact of the Pain:**
   - **Shame and Embarrassment:** Alongside the pain, there's often deep shame about the intensity of the reaction itself. You know it might seem "too much" to others, which only adds to the distress.
   - **Outward or Inward Reactions:**
     - **Outward:** This can look like sudden anger, rage, or extreme tearfulness that seems to come out of nowhere. It's not a choice; it's an overwhelming emotional overflow.
     - **Inward:** Sometimes, the pain is turned inwards, leading to sudden, deep feelings of depression, worthlessness, or even thoughts of self-harm. This can be mistaken for other mood disorders.
   - **People-Pleasing and Avoidance:** To try and prevent this intense pain, people with RSD might become extreme people-pleasers, constantly seeking approval. They might also avoid situations where there's a chance of criticism or failure, which can limit their experiences and opportunities.
4. **Connection to ADHD:**
   - While not everyone with ADHD experiences RSD, there's a strong link. It's thought to be related to how the ADHD brain processes and regulates emotions, often having a lower tolerance for emotional discomfort.

**What this means for our daughter (and for me):**

- When you see her overreacting to something that seems minor, or suddenly becoming withdrawn and sad, it's likely not her being "dramatic" or "overly sensitive." It's her brain experiencing an exaggerated pain response to a perceived rejection or criticism.
- She's not choosing to feel this way, and it's incredibly distressing for her.
- Her intense reactions are often a desperate attempt to cope with or avoid that immense emotional pain.

Understanding RSD can help us have more empathy and patience when these intense reactions occur. It's about recognising that the internal experience is far more painful than what the external situation might suggest.

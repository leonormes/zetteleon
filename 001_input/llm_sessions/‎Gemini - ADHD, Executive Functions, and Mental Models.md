As context load this statement. Our brains are constantly bombarded with an overwhelming amount of sensory information. To make sense of this, they construct simplified models of reality. These mental models act as filters, helping us to navigate the world, make predictions, and decide on actions without having to consciously process every single detail.

I am wondering if ADHD makes it harder to define these models and hold them over time. I struggle with staying consistent or using repeatable process because I always start from scratch each time I do something. I might spend an hour making a plan but as soon as I start the work I go off and forget the plan.

Your analysis is an effective way to describe a core challenge of ADHD. The "mental models" you refer to are built and maintained by a setof cognitive processes known as **executive functions**.

ADHD is fundamentally a disorder of executive function.

These functions are the "management system" of the brain. They include:

- **Working Memory:** The ability to hold information in your mind and manipulate it. This is the "mental notepad" you use to hold your plan.
- **Inhibitory Control:** The ability to stop and think before acting; to filter distractions and stay on task.
- **Cognitive Flexibility:** The ability to switch between tasks or adapt your plan when new information arises.
- **Planning & Prioritisation:** The ability to organise steps and decide what is most important.

Here is a breakdown of how ADHD interacts with your "mental models," based on the experiences you described.

## 1\. Difficulty Defining Models (The Planning Phase)

When you sit down to create a model or a plan, your brain may struggle to filter and sequence information. Instead of a clear, linear process, you might experience:

- **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** You either see all 50 steps at once (which is overwhelming) or you can only focus on the very first, tiny step (and lose sight of the bigger picture).
- **Prioritisation Challenges:** Every part of the plan can feel equally urgent, making it difficult to build a logical, step-by-step "model" of what to do first, next, and last.

## 2\. Difficulty Holding Models (The Execution Phase)

This is the most critical point you raised and it relates directly to **working memory**.

Your experience of "making a plan but forgetting it as soon as I start" is a classic manifestation of an executive function deficit.

- **The "Leaky" Notepad:** A person with ADHD often has a less "sticky" working memory. You create the plan (the "model") and write it on your mental notepad.
- **The "Execution" Cost:** The moment you *start* the first task, the cognitive load of *doing* that task effectively "wipes" the notepad clean. The plan—the overarching "why" and "how"—is pushed out of your active consciousness to make room for the *immediate* sensory details of the in-progress task.
- **Loss of the "Model":** You are now "in the weeds" of Step 1, with no mental model to guide you to Step 2. The plan is not truly "forgotten" (you could probably recall it if asked), but it is no longer *active*.

## 3\. "Starting From Scratch" (The Retrieval Phase)

This relates to both working memory and the creation of *procedural memory* (habits).

- Because you lose the model mid-task, you improvise. The next time you do the *same* task, you don't have a consistent, successful "model" to retrieve from memory.
- Your brain treats it as a new problem every time because the *last* attempt did not follow a stable, repeatable procedure. You are forced to re-build the model from scratch because one was never successfully encoded.

## 4\. The Role of Interest and Novelty

Your brain is also constantly scanning for what is *interesting*, not just what is *important*.

- **A plan is a "deferred-reward" model.** It is logical, but often boring.
- **The "doing" part of a task** is full of new stimuli, potential distractions, and "ooh, a new idea!" moments.
- The ADHD brain, which is often described as having a dopamine-based "interest-driven" nervous system, will almost always abandon the "important/boring" model in favour of the "new/novel/interesting" stimulus that appears *during* the task. This is the "going off" you describe.

## How to Compensate: Externalise Your Mental Model

The primary strategy for managing this is to **stop relying on your internal working memory** to hold the model. You must **externalise the model** and make it a persistent part of your physical environment.

Your internal "RAM" is unreliable; your external environment is not.

1. **Make the Plan Physical and Visible.** Do not put the plan in a closed notebook, a different browser tab, or a minimised app. It must be *in your field of vision* while you work.
	- **Good:** A large whiteboard, a Post-it note stuck to your monitor, a second screen dedicated *only* to the checklist.
	- **Bad:** A file saved on your desktop, a tab in your browser, a page in a notebook you have to remember to open.
2. **Create "Start-Up" Templates.** To combat the "starting from scratch" problem, create a *physical* or *digital template* for any repeatable process.
	- **Example:** For "filming a video," your template might be: 1. Set up lights. 2. Check camera battery. 3. Test microphone. 4. Run script once. 5. Record. 6. Back up footage.
	- When you start, you don't "think." You just pull out the template and follow *your own* instructions. This *is* the mental model, made concrete.
3. **Use It as an Active Tool.** The plan is not just a plan; it is your *boss*.
	- Treat it as a "to-do" list. Physically tick items off as you go.
	- When you get distracted (which you will), your eyes will eventually return to the visible, externalised plan, which will re-orient you. It acts as an anchor.
4. **Simplify the Model.** A 20-step plan is too complex to hold. A 3-step model is not. Use "Now / Next / Then." When you finish "Now," look back at your external plan and re-load the next simple "Now / Next / Then" model.

I have always struggled with the zettelkasten I am trying to maintain. I am interested in New things and I try to capture my understanding as atomic notes that are linked. In my imagination I create notes and art sheet time when thinking about the same topic I come across those notes and develop my thinking using reminders of what I had discovered previously. The zettelkasten literature talks about having a conversation with ones notes. But this just doesn't happen. My notes are either too long and wordy so I don't read them properly or they are too disjointed. I still can't get away from the linked notes just being a personal wiki

This is a common and insightful observation. The challenge you're describing is a direct collision between the *idealised theory* of Zettelkasten and the *practical reality* of an ADHD-wired brain.

The "conversation with your notes" that Zettelkasten experts describe relies on a stable, persistent **internal mental model**. It assumes that when you find an old note, your brain can easily "load" the context, remember why you wrote it, and hold that thought while you connect it to a new one.

As we discussed, this is a *working memory* and *executive function* task. For you, the "notepad gets wiped" constantly. When you open an old note, you are often "starting from scratch" mentally. The context is gone.

Your Zettelkasten feels like a wiki because it's a collection of *facts* (what you captured) without the *thinking* (the connections you've since forgotten).

Here are practical adjustments to make the Zettelkasten method work *for* you, by **externalising the thinking** instead of trying to hold it in your head.

---

## 1\. Solve "Too Disjointed": Focus on the Link, Not the Note

This is the most critical shift. Your problem isn't the notes; it's the *links*. A "disjointed" feeling comes from seeing a link `[[like this]]` and having no idea *why* you linked it.

**The Solution: Make your links contextual.**

When you link two notes, write a sentence *about* the link. The link *is* the thought. This externalises the "conversation" part.

- **Instead of this:**

	> "The sky is blue due to \[\[Rayleigh scattering\]\]." *(This is a wiki link. It's a definition. It requires no thinking.)*

- **Do this:**

	> "The principle of \[\[Rayleigh scattering\]\] is interesting, but it *fails to explain* why sunsets are red, which is where \[\[Mie scattering\]\] becomes more relevant." *(This is a thought. You have externalised the connection. Next time you read this, you don't have to re-invent the idea.)*

- **Or this:**

	> "This new leadership technique I just learned...
	> 
	> - ...is a practical *application* of \[\[Cognitive Load Theory\]\].
	> - ...it directly *contradicts* the advice in \[\[My Old Project Management Note\]\].
	> - ...it reminds me to *ask* \[\[Question about team motivation\]\]."

You are now linking *ideas*, not just *topics*. The note *becomes* the conversation.

---

## 2\. Solve "Too Long and Wordy": The "One Thing" Rule

"Atomic note" is vague. Your "long and wordy" notes are likely the result of a hyperfocus "info dump." You're trying to capture *everything* about a topic at once. This makes the note impossible to re-read because it requires too much cognitive load to "load" into your working memory.

**The Solution: Be ruthlessly "atomic."**

- **One note, one idea.** Not "one topic." The topic of "Cats" is huge. An atomic note is "Cats use purring to heal bones."
- **Give it a descriptive title.** The title should be a full sentence that *states the idea*.
	- **Bad Title:**`Productivity`
	- **Good Title:**`Time blocking is a tool for managing attention, not time`
- When you re-read that good title, you have *already* loaded the entire mental model of that note. You may not even need to read the body.
- If you're writing in a note and a *new* idea pops up, **create a new note for it immediately.** Then link back. This stops the "wordy" note-chaining.

---

## 3\. Solve "Starting From Scratch": Build External Models

Your Zettelkasten *is* your "starting from scratch" problem on a grand scale. You have hundreds of starting points and no clear path. You need to **externalise the structure**.

**The Solution: Create "Maps of Content" (MOCs).**

An MOC is just a note *about* other notes. It is the *externalised mental model* (the "plan") that your brain struggles to hold.

- **Stop waiting for structure to "emerge."** That's bad advice for an executive function challenge. *Impose* structure.
- The *moment* you realise you have 3-4 notes on a similar topic (e.g., `Productivity`), create a new note called `Productivity MOC`.
- In this MOC, you don't write new things. You *organise* your existing notes. You create headings and **link to your atomic notes**.

**Example: `Productivity MOC`**

> ### Core Philosophy
>
> - `[[Time blocking is a tool for managing attention, not time]]`
> - `[[Motivation is interest-driven, not discipline-driven]]`
> 
> ### Practical Techniques
>
> - `[[The 2-Minute Rule for small tasks]]`
> - `[[Using timers to beat procrastination]]`
> 
> ### Unsolved Questions
>
> - `[[How to stay consistent when bored?]]`

Now, when you want to think about "Productivity," you **do not** start from scratch. You go to your `Productivity MOC`. It's your visible, persistent plan. It *loads* your old thinking for you, solving the working memory problem. This is how you have a "conversation." You're literally reading your last thoughts on the subject, all in one place.

I often have a task where I say something like 'learn k8s networking' as a reminder I want to get more knowledgeable at k8s networking. How can I turn that into proper plan with clear definition of done and next actions? Narrate a story of a thought process, with mistakes and edits and being more start now get perfect later

Here is a thought-process narrative for breaking down that exact task.

---

### The "Ugh" Moment

Okay, I'm looking at my to-do list, and... there it is. `learn k8s networking`.

My brain just hits a wall. That's not a task. That's a *career*. It's impossibly huge. What does that even *mean*? Do I mean CNI, Services, Ingress, DNS, Network Policies... all of it? I feel tired just reading it.

I'm going to procrastinate on this forever if it stays like this.

### First Attempt: The "Mistake"

Right. "Start now, get perfect later." Let's just break it down. What are the *parts* of k8s networking?

I'll just list them.

- `Pod-to-Pod networking`
- `Services (ClusterIP, NodePort)`
- `Ingress`
- `DNS`
- `Network Policy`

I look at this list. It's *better*, but it's not a plan. "Pod-to-Pod networking" is *still* a giant, abstract "learn" task. I'm just going to procrastinate on that new, smaller, but still-too-big task. This isn't working. I still don't know *what to do*.

### The "Edit": What's My Actual Problem

Why did I even write `learn k8s networking`?

Oh, right. It was last Tuesday. I was trying to deploy a simple two-tier app, and my `frontend` pod couldn't connect to my `backend` pod. I had no idea how to even *start* debugging it. I didn't know if it was a DNS problem, a Service problem, or... just... magic.

*That's* the real problem. I'm not trying to get a PhD in networking. I'm trying to **not feel lost when my app breaks.**

Okay, this is a much better starting point.

Let's re-frame the whole goal.

**Old Goal:**`learn k8s networking` (Vague, infinite, scary) **New Goal:**`Be able to confidently debug why Pod A cannot talk to Pod B.` (Specific, testable, motivated by a real problem)

### The "Definition of Done"

How will I know when I've achieved this?

**Definition of Done (V1):** "When a connection fails, I can a) pinpoint *where* it's failing (Pod, Service, DNS?) and b) explain *why* it's failing."

This still feels a bit big. Let's shrink it. What's the *first* step in that? Just understanding the simplest possible connection.

**Definition of Done (V2 - much better):** "I can successfully deploy two pods to the *same node* and draw a diagram showing the *exact path* a `ping` takes to get from one to the other. I must be able to name the main 'hops' (e.g., `veth-pair`, `cni-bridge`)."

*Yes*. This is it. This is a solid, achievable, visual goal. I'm not "learning" anymore. I'm "drawing a diagram." I can do that.

### The "Next Actions" (Start Now)

So, how do I get to the point where I can draw that diagram? I can't just draw it now. I need the info.

What's the *absolute smallest* first step?

1. **Action 1 (The "Just Start" Task):**`Find ONE good diagram or video showing "pod-to-pod networking on one node".` I'm not going to "research." I'm going to find *one* visual aid. I'll time-box this to 15 minutes.
	- *...Okay, I did that. I've got a diagram. It mentions "CNI," "veth-pair," and "bridge." I have no idea what those are.*

This immediately defines my next action. The plan is *writing itself* as I go.

1. **Action 2:**`What is a veth-pair?` Search for *just* that. Get a 2-minute explanation.
2. **Action 3:**`What is a CNI plugin (in simple terms)?` Again, just the 101-level concept.
3. **Action 4:**`Okay, let's make it real. Deploy two 'busybox' pods.` I'll find a simple YAML file for it.
4. **Action 5:**`Get a shell inside Pod 1.` (`kubectl exec -it...`)
5. **Action 6:**`Find the IP of Pod 2.` (`kubectl get pods -o wide`)
6. **Action 7:**`Ping Pod 2 from Pod 1.`
7. **Action 8:**`(This is the real test)` `Get a shell on the *node* itself (minikube ssh) and try to *find* the veth-pair for Pod 1. See if its "peer" is on the 'cni0' bridge.`

### The Final Plan (Externalised)

I'm writing this down in my notebook, not my to-do list.

**Project:** Trace a Pod-to-Pod Connection **Goal:** Be able to draw the path of a `ping` from Pod A to Pod B on the same node.

**Definition of Done:** I have successfully used `kubectl exec` and `minikube ssh` to find the Pod IP, the node-level `veth-pair`, and the `cni0` bridge, and I have drawn a simple diagram connecting them.

**Next Actions:**

- `[ ] Find one simple diagram of pod-to-pod networking.`
- `[ ] Get 1-sentence definitions for: CNI, veth-pair, network bridge.`
- `[ ] Find a "deploy two busybox pods" YAML file.`
- `[ ] Run ` kubectl apply `and` kubectl get pods -o wide ` to get their IPs and node.`
- `[ ] ` kubectl exec ` into Pod 1 and ping Pod 2.`
- `[ ] ` minikube ssh `into the node and run` ip link ` to find the veth pair.`
- `[ ] Draw the diagram.`

Look at that. `learn k8s networking` is gone. In its place is a list of simple, concrete `kubectl` commands and Google searches that I can start *right now*. I'll probably get stuck on the `ip link` step and have to Google "how to find veth-pair for pod," but that's fine! That's just a new, small step I can add when I get to it.

I'm not "learning" anymore. I'm *doing*.

Explain the thinking steps I can take generically for any big learn something task. Like a reusable checklist I can apply to break things down enough to get going

Here is a generic, reusable checklist of thinking steps to break down any big "learn something" task into something you can start *now*.

---

## 1\. The "Why" Phase: Find the Real Goal

Stop. Do not list topics or buy books. Ask *why* this is on your list. Your brain will abandon a goal it finds pointless.

- **Mistake:**`learn k8s networking`
- **Find the "Why":** "Why did I write this?" -> "Because my app broke, and I felt stupid and stuck."
- **The Real Goal:**`I want to be able to debug why Pod A can't talk to Pod B.`
- **The Litmus Test:** Does this new goal feel specific and motivated by a real problem? Yes.

## 2\. The "Done" Phase: Define the End State

"Learn" is infinite. Give yourself a finish line. A "Definition of Done" (DoD) is a *physical, observable thing* you can produce.

- **Mistake:** "My DoD is *knowing* k8s networking." (Too vague, unprovable).
- **Good DoD:** "My DoD is successfully deploying a 3-tier app and drawing a diagram of how its components communicate."
- **Better DoD (for starting):** "My DoD is drawing a diagram of how two pods on the *same node* talk to each other." (Shrink it to the first milestone).

## 3\. The "Brain Dump" Phase: Get It Out of Your Head

Now, and only now, do you list topics. Open a blank document and dump every related keyword, question, and sub-topic you can think of. Do *not* organise it. Just type.

- **Example for `learn k8s networking`:**`pods, services, CNI, ingress, DNS, clusterIP, nodeport, what's a veth-pair, how does DNS work, network policy, calico, flannel, debugging, ping, kubectl exec...`

## 4\. The "Model" Phase: Find the 3-5 Pillars

Look at your brain dump. You'll see clumps. Group them. These are your "mental model" pillars. You can't learn everything at once, but you *can* learn one pillar at a time.

- **Example:**
	1. **Pillar 1: Basic Pod Communication** (pods, CNI, veth-pair, bridge)
	2. **Pillar 2: Exposing an App Internally** (services, clusterIP, DNS)
	3. **Pillar 3: Exposing an App Externally** (nodeport, loadbalancer, ingress)
	4. **Pillar 4: Securing It** (network policy)

Pick **Pillar 1**. Ignore the others for now.

## 5\. The "Action" Phase: Find the First Physical Step

Take your *first* pillar and your *first* DoD. Ask: What is the **physical, 2-minute action** I can do *right now*? Do not write "read about CNI." That's a passive, vague "learn" task.

- **Mistake:**`Learn about veth-pairs.`
- **Good Next Action:**`Google "pod to pod networking diagram".`
- **Good Next Action:**`Find a simple YAML file to deploy two 'busybox' pods.`
- **Good Next Action:**`Open my terminal and start minikube.`

This creates a chain. Completing one tiny, physical action will reveal the *next* tiny, physical action. You are no longer "learning"; you are "doing."

---

### The Reusable Checklist (Summary)

1. **Re-frame `Learn X`:** What *problem* am I trying to solve?
2. **Define `Done`:** What *physical thing* can I produce or do that proves I've learned enough (for now)?
3. **Brain Dump:** What are all the words, topics, and questions in my head related to this?
4. **Find Pillars:** What are the 3-5 *main themes* from my brain dump?
5. **Pick Pillar 1:** What is the *first* logical step?
6. **Find Next Action:** What is the *smallest, physical, 2-minute task* I can do to start that first pillar? (e.g., `open a file`, `Google a term`, `run a command`).

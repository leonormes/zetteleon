When I interact socially and professionally I have a sense of how I am doing. Does the other person like me, are they comfortable, do they agree or disagree, What's my status. But how do I make those judgements? What is the margin for error? I have known people who seem to see themselves as much better than they really are and how do I know I'm not doing that?

This is a fundamental aspect of social cognition—the process of trying to build a 'model' of another person's mind and your own position relative to them.

Here is a breakdown of how you make those judgements, the margin for error, and how to calibrate your own self-perception.

## How We Make Social Judgements

Your "sense" is a high-speed, mostly subconscious process of data collection and inference. You are essentially acting as a social detective, gathering clues from multiple channels simultaneously:

- **1\. Non-Verbal Cues (Body Language):** This is likely the largest source of your data.
 	- **Micro-expressions:** Fleeting, involuntary facial expressions that reveal a person's genuine emotion before they can mask it.
 	- **Posture:** Are they 'open' and facing you, or 'closed' (arms crossed, turned away)? Leaning in (interest) vs. leaning back (disengagement, judgement).
 	- **Eye Contact:** Are they holding your gaze (confidence, interest, or potential aggression), or avoiding it (shyness, discomfort, or sometimes, deference)?
 	- **Gestures:** Are they mirroring your own body language (a strong sign of rapport) or are their gestures fidgety and anxious?
- **2\. Paralanguage (Tone of Voice):** This is *how* something is said, rather than *what* is said.
 	- **Pitch and Volume:** A rising intonation can signal a question or uncertainty. A low, flat tone can signal boredom or disapproval. Sudden volume changes indicate emotional spikes.
 	- **Pace:** Speaking quickly can show enthusiasm or anxiety; speaking slowly can show thoughtfulness or condescension.
 	- **Vocal Congruence:** Does their tone match their words? When someone says "That's great" in a flat, dead tone, your brain flags the mismatch.
- **3\. Verbal Content:** The actual words used are a clue, but often less reliable than *how* they are said.
 	- **Question-Asking:** Is the other person asking you questions? This shows engagement and interest.
 	- **"I" vs. "You" vs. "We":** A lot of "we" language can signal rapport and shared understanding. A lot of "I" can signal self-focus, while a lot of "you" can be engaging or, in another context, accusatory.
- **4\. Social Comparison:** You automatically assess your 'status' by comparing yourself to others based on perceived markers of authority, expertise, or social value (e.g., who is everyone listening to? Who controls the flow of conversation?).
- **5\. Emotional Contagion:** This is your brain's capacity for empathy. You subconsciously 'catch' the emotional state of others. If you walk into a room and suddenly feel tense, you are likely picking up on the anxiety of others.

## The Margin for Error (And Why It's So Large)

Your "sense" is a rough sketch, not a photograph. The margin for error is significant, primarily due to cognitive biases.

- **The "Mind-Reading" Fallacy:** You assume you know what someone is thinking based on the cues above. **This is an inference, not a fact.** The most common error is projecting your own anxieties onto others. You *feel* awkward, so you *assume* they think you are awkward.
- **Confirmation Bias:** Once you form an initial hypothesis (e.g., "This person doesn't like me"), your brain will actively search for evidence that confirms it and ignore evidence that contradicts it. You'll notice their brief frown but miss the five times they smiled.
- **The Spotlight Effect:** We vastly overestimate how much other people are noticing us, especially our flaws. You might be obsessing over a word you misspoke, while the other person has already forgotten it, or perhaps didn't even notice.
- **Fundamental Attribution Error:** We tend to attribute our own failures to external factors ("I was rude because I'm stressed"), but others' failures to their personality ("They were rude because they are a bad person").
- **Ambiguity:** The data is simply unclear. Crossed arms can mean "I am defensively rejecting your idea," but it can just as easily mean "I am cold" or "This is just a comfortable way for me to sit." We tend to choose the most negative interpretation when we feel insecure.

## How to Know You're Not Deceiving Yourself

The people you mention, who see themselves as "much better than they really are," are often displaying a version of the **Dunning-Kruger Effect**. This is a cognitive bias where people with low ability at a task (including social skills) overestimate their ability.Their incompetence robs them of the meta-cognition (the ability to think about their own thinking) required to realise they are incompetent.

The very fact that you are asking this question is the single best sign that you are *not* hopelessly trapped in that state. You are demonstrating self-awareness.

Here are practical ways to calibrate your self-perception:

- **1\. Shift from "Mind-Reading" to "Observation":**
 	- **Instead of:** "He thinks I'm an idiot."
 	- **Ask:** "What did I *actually* observe? He looked at his watch. What are three alternative explanations? 1) He's late for another meeting. 2) He's waiting on an important email. 3) He's just checking the time." This breaks the negative feedback loop.
- **2\. Seek Trusted, Specific Feedback:**
 	- This is the gold standard for bursting a self-perception bubble (whether over-inflated or under-inflated).
 	- Don't ask vague questions like "Do people like me?". Ask a trusted friend, mentor, or colleague *specific* questions:
  		- "After that presentation, what was one thing you thought worked well, and one thing I could improve?"
  		- "I'm trying to be a better listener. In that meeting, did you feel I gave people enough space to talk?"
- **3\. Focus on Your Behaviour, Not Their "Liking":**
 	- You cannot control if someone *likes* you. You *can* control your own actions.
 	- Instead of worrying about your status, judge yourself on concrete behaviours:
  		- Did I listen without interrupting?
  		- Did I ask at least one genuine question about the other person?
  		- Did I express my point of view clearly and respectfully?
 	- Good social skills (your actions) tend to lead to good social outcomes (their feelings).
- **4\. Record and Review (If Applicable):**
 	- For high-stakes professional situations (like a big presentation), recording yourself (video or just audio) is a powerful, if uncomfortable, tool. You will see *exactly* what others see, bypassing your internal 'sense'.
- **5\. Accept Ambiguity:**
 	- Ultimately, you will *never* know with 100% certainty what another person is thinking. Part of social competence is learning to tolerate this ambiguity without letting it spiral into anxiety. Your "sense" is a guide, not a gospel. Use it, but hold its conclusions lightly.

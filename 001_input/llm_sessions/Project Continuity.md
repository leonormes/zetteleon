First, let’s understand what’s happening from a cognitive perspective. When you’re deeply engaged in creative work, you’re experiencing what’s called a “flow state.” For someone with ADHD, these states can be particularly intense and productive because your brain is getting optimal dopamine stimulation. The challenge comes when you try to re-enter this state later, as the project no longer provides the same novelty-driven dopamine release that initially helped you engage.

Here’s a structured approach to building bridges between these work sessions:

## 1. End-of-Session Documentation

When you’re still in that flow state and have that clear mental model, take 10-15 minutes to create what I call a “Future Self Brief.” This isn’t just standard documentation - it’s specifically designed to help reconnect with your thought process:

- Record your current excitement: “Right now, I’m most excited about
- Capture your mental model: “The way I’m thinking about this system is like
- Note decision points: “I chose to do
- Flag unfinished threads: “The next three things I wanted to explore were…”

## 2. Visual Thinking Tools

Since you mentioned having a clear mental model during active work, let’s preserve that visually:

- Create a quick mind map or sketch of how you’re seeing the project’s components interact
- Use color coding to indicate different levels of completion or priority
- Take photos of any physical notes or drawings you’ve made
- Record a brief voice memo explaining your visualization if that feels natural

## 3. Momentum-Based Re-Entry Points

Instead of trying to dive back in at the deep end, create multiple “shallow” entry points:

- Break down the next steps into very small, concrete tasks (smaller than you think necessary)
- Label some tasks specifically as “easy wins” or “good starting points”
- Leave something intentionally unfinished but well-documented, giving your future self an obvious place to begin
- Create a “project playlist” - a sequence of small tasks that help rebuild momentum

## 4. Context Preservation

To help maintain the project’s novelty and personal meaning:

- Keep a “project story” document that tracks your evolving vision and breakthrough moments
- Maintain a list of “future exciting possibilities” that you can review to rekindle inspiration
- Document personal connections and why this project matters to you specifically
- Create “curiosity hooks” - questions or challenges you want to explore

## 5. Environmental Anchors

Use environmental cues to help rebuild your mental context:

- Create a specific project workspace (physical or digital) that you only use for this work
- Develop a brief “startup ritual” that helps you re-enter the project mindset
- Use music, scents, or other environmental cues consistently during work sessions
- Keep visual representations of the project visible in your workspace

## 6. Dopamine-Aware Planning

Work with your brain’s reward system:

- Build in small, frequent wins that you can achieve quickly
- Create a “progress visualization” that makes small steps feel meaningful
- Plan your re-entry around your peak focus times
- Have a “next action” list that’s sorted by energy level required, so you can match tasks to your state

## Implementation Strategy

Start small - pick just one or two of these approaches to try first. I recommend beginning with the End-of-Session Documentation and one other strategy that particularly resonates with you. The goal is to build a sustainable practice, not to implement everything at once.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these strategies or help you customize them for your specific project context? I can also provide examples of how to structure the documentation tools I’ve described.

Remember: The goal isn’t to perfectly recreate your initial flow state, but to build reliable bridges that make it easier to re-engage with your work meaningfully. Each time you successfully return to a project, you’re building evidence that counters the “start fresh” impulse, making it easier to maintain continuity in future projects.

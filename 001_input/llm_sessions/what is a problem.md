Understanding Problems: Definitions, Frameworks, and Applications

1. General Definition: A Domain-Agnostic Perspective

A problem is a perceived gap between a current state and a desired state, where the path to closing that gap is non-obvious or obstructed.

From various perspectives:

· Philosophical: A problem exists when reality (the "is") differs from our expectations, values, or goals (the "ought"), and this discrepancy requires conscious effort to resolve.

· Logical: A problem is an inconsistent or unsatisfying state within a system that necessitates a solution to restore consistency or achieve satisfaction.

· Systems-Thinking: A problem represents a dysfunction, imbalance, or undesired output within a system where the causal relationships aren't fully understood or are producing undesirable results.

Key Characteristics:

· Requires mental effort beyond routine execution

· Involves uncertainty about the solution path

· Demands analysis before action can be taken effectively

Example: Being lost in an unfamiliar city is a problem. The current state (where you are) differs from the desired state (your destination), and you don't know how to get there.

2. Productivity Framework: Distinctions and Relationships

What Makes Something a "Problem" (vs. Task, Goal, or Situation)

Problem: A gap with solution uncertainty. You know what you want, but not how to get there.

Task: A defined action with a clear procedure. No significant uncertainty about "how."

Goal: A desired endpoint without specifying the path. May contain multiple problems to solve.

Situation: A state of affairs that may or may not contain problems.

Aspect Problem Task Goal

Certainty High uncertainty about means Certain about means Certain about ends

Required Activity Analysis then action Direct action Direction-setting then problem-solving

Cognitive Load High (requires problem-space navigation) Low to medium (procedural) Medium (requires decomposition)

Example:

· Situation: Sales are declining

· Problem: We don't understand why sales are declining

· Task: Call 10 customers for feedback (if you know exactly how to do this)

· Goal: Increase sales by 20% in Q3

What Constitutes a "Constraint" in Problem-Solving

A constraint is a limitation or condition that bounds the solution space of a problem. Constraints define what solutions are acceptable or possible.

Types of Constraints:

1. Resource Constraints: Time, money, personnel, materials
2. Physical Constraints: Laws of nature, spatial limitations
3. Social Constraints: Laws, regulations, cultural norms, ethical boundaries
4. System Constraints: Technical limitations, interoperability requirements
5. Self-Imposed Constraints: Personal principles, quality standards, aesthetic preferences

Example: For the problem "design a bridge across this river," constraints might include: budget ($2M max), timeline (6 months), materials (must withstand certain weather conditions), safety regulations, and environmental impact limits.

How Problems and Constraints Relate

Problems define the gap; constraints define the boundaries within which solutions must be found.

The relationship is dynamic:

· Constraints shape problems by limiting possible solutions

· Problem analysis often reveals hidden constraints

· Sometimes, constraint modification is part of the solution (e.g., securing more budget)

· Distinguishing between hard constraints (immovable) and soft constraints (negotiable) is crucial

Example: If your problem is "get from New York to London in the fastest way possible," but you discover you have a severe peanut allergy (constraint), commercial flights might be eliminated from your solution space, fundamentally changing the problem-solving approach.

3. Practical Application

Identifying Problems vs. Other Challenges

Ask these diagnostic questions:

1. "Do I know exactly how to accomplish this?" → If NO, it's likely a problem
2. "Is there significant uncertainty about the path forward?" → If YES, it's likely a problem
3. "Can this be solved by following a known procedure?" → If NO, it's likely a problem
4. "Am I facing multiple possible paths with unclear trade-offs?" → If YES, it's likely a problem

Practice exercise: When faced with a challenge, label it as:

· Procedure (task)

· Direction-setting (goal)

· Gap-closing with uncertainty (problem)

· Context (situation)

Example: "My team isn't collaborating well" is a situation. "I don't know how to improve team collaboration" is the problem within that situation.

Structuring Problem-Solving Effectively

Use the Problem-Constraint-Solution Framework:

1. Define the problem gap precisely: "I want X, but I have Y instead."
   · Bad: "The website is broken"
   · Good: "Mobile users can't complete purchases (current state) but should be able to (desired state)"
2. Identify and categorize constraints:
   · List all constraints
   · Label each: Hard/Soft, Known/Assumed
   · Challenge assumptions: "Is this truly a constraint or just habit?"
3. Work within and sometimes on the constraints:
   · First, solve within existing constraints
   · If no adequate solution exists, identify which constraints might be modified
   · Negotiate constraint modification where possible

Example workflow:

Situation: Project behind schedule

Problem: We're 3 weeks behind with 4 weeks until deadline

Constraints: Fixed deadline, no additional budget, must maintain quality standards

Approach:

1. Identify if work can be reprioritized within constraints
2. If not, determine if deadline (constraint) can be negotiated
3. If not, determine if quality standards (constraint) can be adjusted

Distinguishing Problems from Constraints

Problems are about direction; constraints are about boundaries.

Clarification technique: Use "how" and "within what limits" questions:

· "How do we achieve [desired state]?" → Problem

· "Within what limits must we achieve it?" → Constraints

Common pitfall: Mistaking a constraint for the problem.

Example:

· Actual problem: Get 100 people to attend our event

· Constraint: Budget of $500

· Misidentification: "The problem is our small budget"

· Correction: "The problem is attracting attendees given our budget constraint"

Actionable approach:

1. Write the problem statement without mentioning constraints
2. List constraints separately
3. Solve the problem while respecting constraints
4. Only if impossible, revisit whether constraints are truly fixed

Final Recommendation: Keep a "problem journal" for a week. For each challenge, practice:

1. Writing a clear problem statement (gap only)
2. Listing constraints separately
3. Noting which constraints are truly fixed vs. negotiable

This disciplined approach will sharpen your problem identification skills and make your problem-solving more systematic and effective across all domains of life.

Here’s a detailed, multi‐perspective breakdown of what a “problem” is: how it differs from tasks/goals/situations; what constraints are; and how to use these ideas in practice. I’ll include general definitions, productivity‐focused ones, and actionable guidance with examples.

1. General Definition

From philosophical, logical, and systems‐thinking viewpoints, a “problem” has several core elements:

- **Gap between states**: There is an *actual state* (what is) and a *desired state* (what should be). A problem is present when these differ. ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10202-011-0091-0?utm_source=openai))  
- **Obstacle or barrier**: Something prevents transformation from the actual to the desired state. It isn't enough that you prefer one state over another—you must also recognize that something blocks you. ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10202-011-0091-0?utm_source=openai))  
- **Knowledge or action deficit**: The absence of a known, feasible, or acceptable transformation (“transformation knowledge”) that will carry you from actual to desired. Without uncertainty about how to move forward, there is no problem to solve in full. ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10202-011-0091-0?utm_source=openai))

So more formally: **A problem is when an agent perceives that their current situation is undesirable relative to some target state, and there is at least one barrier preventing attainment of that target, with no known, immediate transformation to bridge the gap.**

Important further distinctions:

- **Well‐defined vs ill‐defined problems**: A well‐defined problem has clear actual state, clear goal, and knowable steps to solve. An ill‐defined problem lacks clarity in one or more of these. ([knowt.com](https://knowt.com/note/00de1465-28cb-49ee-b264-ef7fd345024f/CP-3?utm_source=openai))  
- **Logical conflict/incompatibility view**: Philosophical definitions sometimes frame problems as incompatibilities among propositions or between beliefs and evidence. For example, schemata where you believe “X is true” and also believe “X is false” creates a logical problem. ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10202-011-0091-0?utm_source=openai))

2. Productivity Framework: What Makes Something a Problem vs Task or Goal; What Constraints Are; How They Relate

What makes something a “problem” (vs task, goal, or situation)

Here are how these differ:

Concept	Definition / Key Elements

**Goal**	A **desired future state**, that is specific and intentionally chosen. It establishes what you want. It may be measurable, bound in time, etc. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting?utm_source=openai))

**Task**	A specific action or set of actions taken to move toward a goal. Tasks are about doing something concrete; they often represent sub‐steps of a larger goal or project. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management?utm_source=openai))

**Situation**	A neutral description of the current context or environment—what is. There is not necessarily a judgment of “undesirable,” nor a goal defined.

**Problem**	As above: when situation vs goal differ, and barriers exist. A problem is **not** simply having tasks or goals—it involves the recognition of a gap and the absence of immediate method to close it fully without addressing obstacles.

What constitutes a “constraint”

- A **constraint** is any condition, resource limit, requirement, assumption, or rule that restricts what possible actions or paths are permissible or feasible in solving a problem. It defines what “counts” as acceptable solution space.  
- In mathematics/optimization, constraints are explicit equations or inequalities limiting variable assignments; in general problem‐solving, constraints are resource limits, regulations, dependencies, unavailable information, etc. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_%28mathematics%29?utm_source=openai))

How problems and constraints relate

- Problems always come with constraints: they are part of what makes the gap non‐trivial. Without constraints, the path from actual to goal would be trivial or obvious.  
- Constraints **shape** the problem: they define what solutions are possible or desirable and may affect cost, time, quality.  
- Some constraints are **hard** (must be met), others **soft** (preferred but negotiable). In many real contexts, trade‐offs exist.

⸻

3. Practical Application: Using These Definitions

Using these definitions actively can improve clarity, decision‐making, and effectiveness.

A. Identifying when you’re facing a “problem” vs “other types of challenges”

Ask:

1. **Is there a desired state vs current state?** If not, maybe you have a goal or opportunity, not yet a problem.  
*Example*: Wanting to learn French is a goal. Struggling to pay rent is a problem once you define “financial stability” and see the gap.

2. **Is something blocking progress?** If you have a goal and could see immediate paths forward, it’s likely not yet a problem. The presence of barriers (lack of resources, knowledge, time) confirms you're dealing with a problem.
3. **Do you know how to get there immediately?** If yes, the challenge becomes a task; if not, it’s a full problem.

B. Structuring approach to problem solving more effectively

Using a generic template adapted from philosophical & psychological models:

- **Actual state**: Describe as precisely as possible what is happening.  
- **Desired state (Goal state)**: What is the ideal outcome or target?  
- **Constraints (Barriers, Obstacles)**: List what stands in the way—resource, information, skills, time, assumptions.  
- **Transformation knowledge**: What known methods or paths might help? If none, you need to explore, research, experiment.

Then:

- Scope the problem: is it well‐defined or not? If ill‐defined, clarifying the goal and constraints is an early step.  
- Generate potential solution paths, evaluate against constraints.  
- Choose a path, test/iterate, adjust constraints or goals if needed.

C. Distinguishing between the problem vs its constraints

- **Problem core**: Always the gap + desire for outcome. The *what* you want vs *where you are*.  
- **Constraints**: Details about the *how* that limit possible solutions.

Practical tip: when working out, draw two boxes:

- **Box A (Problem Statement)**: “Current vs desired state” in one sentence.  
- **Box B (Constraints List)**: All things that limit solving (time, budget, permissions, knowledge, etc.).

Example:

- Problem: “I want to publish a book (desired) but haven’t found a publisher or agent (actual), and don’t know how to reach one or whether my manuscript is good enough.”  
- Constraints: lack of industry contacts, manuscript quality, time for revision, rejection risk, financial cost of editing, etc.

You can then ask: which constraints are negotiable? Which are hard? Which ones you can focus on first?  

⸻

Examples Across Domains

To ground this, here are domain‐specific illustrations:

1. **Work / Technical Challenge**

- Actual state: Database queries on large datasets take 30 seconds.  
- Desired: Query time < 2 seconds.  
- Constraints: current database schema; hardware limits; indexing knowledge; code base constraints; budget for new hardware.  
- Problem: the gap + these constraints. Tasks would include “profile slow queries,” “add indices,” etc. Goals are achieving target query speed.

2. **Personal / Life**

- Actual: You are sleep‐deprived; sleep quality poor.  
- Desired: Sleep 7–8 hours nightly, waking feeling rested.  
- Constraints: noisy environment; irregular schedule; health issues; screen use before bed.  

3. **Productivity / Goal Setting**

- Goal: Run 10km.  
- Problem: you can currently run <5km, training time constrained by work, knee pain, lack of proper shoes.

⸻

Summary & Actionable Checklist

Here’s a short checklist you can apply in any domain:

- ✅ Define *actual state* clearly  
- ✅ Define *desired state / goal* clearly  
- ✅ Identify **barriers / constraints**: list them, categorize hard vs soft  
- ✅ Clarify why it isn’t merely a task (you don’t yet have a pathway) or just a goal (you perceive obstacles)  
- ✅ Decide which constraints you can change or remove; which you must work with  
- ✅ Generate solution paths; evaluate each against constraints  
- ✅ Iterate—test small, adjust constraints or goal if required

Using this can help avoid fuzzy “problems” where you’re merely unclear; sharpen focus on what blocks you; and make better decisions.

If you like, I can also show you how this maps to common productivity frameworks (e.g. GTD, Agile, etc.) and give templates or tools you can use. Do you want me to pull those in?

To provide a comprehensive understanding of what constitutes a "problem," we can synthesize perspectives from systems thinking, formal logic, and productivity frameworks.

1. General Definition (Domain-Agnostic)
From the broadest philosophical and logical perspectives, a "problem" is not merely something "bad" that happens. It is defined by structure rather than sentiment.
The "Gap + Uncertainty" Definition
A problem exists effectively only when three specific components are present simultaneously:
 - Current State: Where you are now (Reality).
 - Desired State: Where you want to be (Goal).
 - The Gap (Uncertainty): You do not immediately know how to move from the current state to the desired state.
Perspectives:
 - Logic & Philosophy: A problem is defined by imperfect knowledge. If you are hungry (Current) and want food (Desired) and know exactly how to get an apple (Method), you do not have a problem; you have a task. You only have a problem if you want food but do not know where to find it or how to acquire it.
 - Systems Thinking: A problem is viewed as a "System of Interest" where interacting components (people, resources, rules) are producing an output that deviates from the desired norm. In this view, a problem is not an isolated event but an emergent property of the system's current structure.
2. Productivity Framework
In a productivity context, precise definitions prevent "busy work" (treating problems like tasks) and "frustration" (treating constraints like problems).
A. Problem vs. Task, Goal, & Situation
 - Situation: A neutral snapshot of reality. "It is raining" is a situation. It only becomes a problem if your Goal involves staying dry.
 - Goal: The target outcome or the "Desired State." Goals define the destination; they do not imply difficulty.
 - Task: A unit of work where the path to execution is known. If you can write it on a to-do list and immediately execute it without further discovery, it is a task, not a problem.
 - The "Problem": A goal that has resistance. It is the specific obstacle or lack of knowledge preventing you from turning a Goal into a series of Tasks.
B. What constitutes a "Constraint"?
A constraint is a boundary condition that limits the "feasible region" of your solution. It is a variable you cannot change, at least not within the current scope.
 - Hard Constraints: Binary limits that must be satisfied (e.g., "The physics of the bridge must support 10 tons," "The budget is exactly $0").
 - Soft Constraints: Preferences that are penalized if violated but don't invalidate the solution (e.g., "We prefer to finish by Friday").
C. The Relationship: The "Search Space"
Imagine problem-solving as looking for a treasure on a map.
 - The Problem is finding the specific coordinates of the treasure.
 - The Constraints are the edges of the map or the "Do Not Enter" zones.
 - Key Insight: Constraints are helpful because they reduce the area you have to search. A problem with zero constraints is often harder to solve because the possibilities are infinite.
3. Practical Application
Use these definitions to restructure how you approach your work.
A. Better Identification: The "Knowledge Gap" Test
When you feel stuck, ask: "Do I know exactly what step to take next?"
 - If YES: You are procrastinating on a Task. Just do it.
 - If NO: You have a Problem. Stop trying to "do" it. Switch modes to "Solve" it. You need to gather information or design a path.
B. Structuring Your Approach: The "Gap Definition" First
Before you try to solve anything, write down the three components explicitly. This prevents "Solutioneering" (jumping to fixes without understanding the issue).
 - Current State: (e.g., "Website conversion is 1%.")
 - Desired State: (e.g., "Website conversion is 3%.")
 - The Gap: (e.g., "We don't know why users are dropping off at checkout.")
   - Action: Your immediate next step is not "Redesign the site" (Solution), but "Install analytics to watch checkout" (Bridging the Knowledge Gap).
C. Distinguishing Problems vs. Constraints: The Control Test
Use the "1-Minute Decision Tree" to separate solvable issues from reality acceptance.
 - Question: "Can I, my team, or my boss change this factor right now?"
   - Yes: It is a Problem. Allocate resources to solve it.
   - No: It is a Constraint. Do not waste energy trying to "solve" it. Instead, optimize around it.
Example:
 - Scenario: You need to drive to a meeting, but there is heavy traffic.
 - Analysis: Can you remove the cars? No.
 - Verdict: Traffic is a Constraint.
 - New Problem: "How do I attend the meeting given the constraint of traffic?" (Solution: Call in via Zoom, leave earlier). Traffic itself is not the problem to be fixed.

## 1. General, Domain‑Agnostic Definition of a “Problem”

### 1.1 Core, cross‑domain Definition

A very general, actionable definition:

> **A problem is a situation where an agent wants a different state of affairs, but does not yet know an acceptable way to get from the current state to the desired state, given the conditions they’re under.**

That packs in a few elements:

1. **Agent** – someone or something that cares (you, a team, an organization, an algorithm).
2. **Current state** – how things are now.
3. **Desired state** – how you want things to be.
4. **Gap** – a difference between current and desired.
5. **Obstacles / uncertainty** – you **don’t yet have a clear, accepted procedure** to close the gap.
6. **Conditions** – constraints, rules, costs, risks, time, capabilities, etc.

If you already have a straightforward, known procedure that you can just execute, you have **work** (tasks), not really a “problem” in the strict sense.

### 1.2 From Logic / Cognitive Science

A classic formulation (Newell & Simon, problem‑solving research):

> A problem exists when an agent has a goal but does not know how to reach it.

This is essentially the same as above, stripped down.

### 1.3 From Systems Thinking

In systems terms:

> A problem is a pattern of behavior in a system that deviates from what is desired or required, and for which the mechanisms producing that pattern are not yet understood or controlled.

- It emphasizes: **behavior over time**, **underlying structure**, and **lack of leverage** (you don’t yet know where to act).

---

## 2. Productivity Framework: Problems, Tasks, Goals, Situations, Constraints

### 2.1 Distinguishing “problem” from Task, Goal, Situation

Think of four layers:

1. **Situation** – neutral description, no preference implied  
   - “There are 200 open Jira tickets.”  
   - “I have 5 unread emails.”

2. **Goal** – a preferred state  
   - “I want all P1 bugs fixed by Friday.”  
   - “I want inbox to be under 20 emails.”

3. **Task** – a known, concrete action or sequence of actions  
   - “Update the failing test and push a fix.”  
   - “Reply to this email with the latest status.”  

   Key property: **you already know exactly what to do**. Uncertainty is low. Mostly execution.

4. **Problem** – goal present, but path is not yet clear or acceptable  
   - “Production errors spike randomly; I don’t know why.”  
   - “We keep missing deadlines even though everyone is busy.”  
   - “I want to focus for 2 hours/day, but my attention keeps fragmenting.”

   Key property: **you must figure out *what* to do before you can just do it.** There is a nontrivial “thinking / designing / deciding” step.

**Heuristic:**

- If you can write a clear “do X, then Y, then Z” and it’s obviously feasible → **task / project.**
- If you cannot yet say what concrete actions will work, or you’re unsure which trade‑offs are acceptable → **problem.**

---

### 2.2 What is a “constraint” in problem‑solving

In productivity/problem‑solving terms:

> **A constraint is any limit on what counts as an acceptable solution or on how you are allowed or able to reach it.**

Common types of constraints:

1. **Resource constraints**
   - Time: “Must be done by Friday.”
   - Money: “Budget is capped at $5,000.”
   - People: “Only 1 engineer is available.”

2. **Quality / performance constraints**
   - “Latency must be < 200ms p95.”
   - “Workout plan must not aggravate my knee.”

3. **Policy / rules / ethical constraints**
   - “We can’t store this data unencrypted.”
   - “No working past 7pm for health reasons.”

4. **External conditions / environment**
   - “The API we depend on is rate‑limited.”
   - “Kids go to bed at 9pm so evenings are constrained.”

5. **Personal limitations / preferences**
   - “I can’t reliably focus for >25 minutes straight.”  
   - “I’m unwilling to move cities for this job.”

**Hard vs Soft constraints:**

- **Hard**: breaking them means the solution is invalid. (“Must be legally compliant.”)
- **Soft**: you prefer not to violate, but you can if necessary. (“Prefer not to work weekends.”)

---

### 2.3 How Problems and Constraints Relate

- **Constraints define the shape of the problem.**  
  Without constraints, many “problems” become trivial.

  - Example: “The build is slow.”  
    - With no constraints: buy massive hardware, done.  
    - Actual constraints: budget, infrastructure, team, risk → now it’s a real problem.
- **Constraints carve out the solution space.**
  - All theoretically possible solutions form a big space.
  - Constraints eliminate regions of that space.
  - The problem is: “Find a path from current state to goal **within** this constrained space.”
- **Sometimes, “the problem” is essentially: the constraints conflict.**
  - “Ship in 1 week” + “Zero bugs” + “Major refactor” = impossible.  
  - Then the real problem is: “How to renegotiate or prioritize constraints?”

---

## 3. Practical Application

### 3.1 Identifying: Am I Facing a Problem or Something Else

A quick mental checklist:

1. **Is there a gap?**
   - Current vs desired:  
     “What about this situation do I want to be different?”

2. **Do I already know how to fix it concretely?**
   - If **yes**: It’s a **task** or **project**.
     - Example: “Tests are failing because of a known regression; I just need to revert a commit.” → Work queue.
   - If **no** or “not sure which way is best”: It’s a **problem**.
     - Example: “We keep getting flaky tests in CI for unknown reasons.” → Problem.

3. **Is my difficulty mainly:**
   - **Doing the thing** I already know how to do? → Execution challenge, maybe motivation/productivity, but not fundamentally a problem in the sense above.
   - **Figuring out what to do** or **how to respect constraints**? → Problem.

4. **Is there any dissatisfaction or goal at all?**
   - If not, it’s just a **situation**, not a problem.  
     - “I have 10 tabs open.” Only becomes a problem if you want fewer and care about it.

**ADHD‑friendly micro‑prompt you can use:**

> “Do I not know what to do, or do I know but can’t get myself to do it?”

- **Don’t know what to do** → define the problem and constraints.  
- **Know what to do but can’t get started** → treat as execution/productivity issue (break into tiny tasks, use timers, etc.), not problem‑solving.

---

### 3.2 Structuring Your Approach to problem‑solving

You can turn the definitions into a small, reusable workflow:

#### Step 1 – Name the Situation

Write 1–2 sentences: **“What is happening?”**

- Example (work): “API clients are frequently timing out during peak hours.”
- Example (personal): “I repeatedly stay up past midnight scrolling on my phone.”

#### Step 2 – State the Desired Outcome (goal)

Ask: **“If this were resolved, what would be true?”**

- Work: “95% of requests complete in under 200ms at peak load.”
- Personal: “I’m asleep by 11:30pm on weeknights most of the time.”

Now you’ve got the **gap**: situation vs desired.

#### Step 3 – Decide: Problem or just Tasks

Ask:

> “Do I already see a clear, feasible sequence of actions to get from current to desired?”

- If **yes**:  
  - You have tasks/projects.  
  - Put them in your task system:  
    - “Add index to X table.”  
    - “Set phone to grayscale at 10pm; keep charger away from bed.”
- If **no**:  
  - You have a **problem**. Explicitly label it:
    - “Problem: We don’t know why the API times out at peak.”
    - “Problem: I don’t know how to design an evening routine that actually works for my brain.”

Just putting “Problem:” in front is surprisingly helpful for thinking clearly.

#### Step 4 – List Constraints Explicitly

Ask:

> “What are the limits on acceptable solutions and on how I can reach them?”

Work example – API timeouts:

- Hard constraints:
  - Must maintain backward compatibility with existing clients.
  - Can’t exceed current infra budget by more than 15%.
  - Must be resolved within 6 weeks.
- Soft constraints:
  - Prefer not to introduce new major dependencies.
  - Prefer solutions that devs can easily maintain.

Personal example – bedtime:

- Hard constraints:
  - Need to wake up at 7am for work.
  - Screen time before bed worsens sleep.
- Soft constraints:
  - Prefer not to cut gaming completely.
  - Prefer minimal complicated routines.

#### Step 5 – Separate Problem from Constraints

Write them in two clear blocks:

- **Problem statement:** a short sentence that describes the gap + uncertainty.
- **Constraints:** a bullet list.

Example (technical):

- Problem:  
  “Our web app response time degrades from ~150ms to 2–3s under load, and we don’t know which components are causing the bottleneck.”
- Constraints:
  - Hard: p95 latency must be < 300ms by end of quarter.
  - Hard: Can’t add more than 20% infra cost.
  - Soft: Avoid rewrites unless strictly necessary.

Now solutions can be evaluated against those constraints without confusing them with the problem itself.

#### Step 6 – Turn Problem into Experiments / sub‑problems

Problems dissolve into tasks once you have an approach:

1. **Information‑gathering tasks** (instrumentation, research, asking people).
2. **Design / ideation** (brainstorming solution paths within constraints).
3. **Evaluation** (which option best respects constraints).
4. **Execution tasks**.

You move from:

> “I don’t know what to do” (problem)

to

> “Here are three possible ways; now I just need to pick and execute” (project with tasks).

---

### 3.3 Distinguishing Problem Vs Constraints in Practice

Some typical confusions and how to reframe them.

#### Example 1 – “We Need microservices”

- This is actually a **solution guess**, not a problem.
- Try to restate:
  - Problem: “Our monolith slows down development; adding features takes weeks because modules are tightly coupled.”
  - Constraints:
    - Must keep production stable.
    - No more than X months of migration effort.
    - Team of Y people; limited capacity for re‑architecture.

Now you can consider multiple solutions (modularization within the monolith, microservices, feature toggles, etc.) and check each against constraints.

#### Example 2 – “I can’t Focus on Coding for More than 15 minutes”

- Problem:  
  “I want sustained coding focus for at least 60–90 minutes/day, but my attention fragments after ~15 minutes.”
- Constraints:
  - Hard: I have ADHD; brute‑forcing long focus blocks doesn’t work.
  - Hard: 9am–5pm work schedule.
  - Soft: Prefer to avoid meds changes right now.
  - Soft: Prefer not to work evenings.

Now you can explore solution patterns (Pomodoro, environment tweaks, pairing, timeboxing, working with natural energy peaks) within that constraint set, instead of just feeling “I’m bad at focusing.”

#### Example 3 – “I’m Always behind on everything”

Break it down:

- Situation: “My task list keeps growing; I end most weeks with more open than closed items.”
- Desired: “I want a sustainable system where most weeks I finish the important work and don’t feel constantly behind.”
- Problem: “I don’t know how to design and maintain a realistic workload and prioritization system that fits my energy and constraints.”
- Constraints:
  - 40‑hour workweek.
  - Must fulfill core job responsibilities.
  - ADHD → limited sustained focus; context switching is draining.
  - Prefer simple tools over complex setups.

Now you can test specific changes (WIP limits, daily top 3, no‑meeting focus blocks) as possible solutions.

## Summary: Compact, Reusable Definitions

You can keep these as a quick mental model:

- **Problem:**  
  A gap between current and desired state **where you don’t yet know an acceptable way to close the gap**, given your conditions.

- **Task:**  
  A specific action (or sequence) you already know how to do.

- **Goal:**  
  A description of a desired state or outcome.

- **Situation:**  
  A description of how things are, without any implied desire to change it.

- **Constraint:**  
  Any limit on what counts as an acceptable solution or on how you are allowed or able to reach your goal (time, money, rules, health, values, etc.).

If you’d like, next we can:

- Take a few of your real current challenges (technical or personal),
- Run them through this framework,
- And turn each one into a clear **problem + constraints + candidate tasks** so it’s easier to act on.

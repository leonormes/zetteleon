title: Could a computer then actually be defined by what

That's a very interesting and insightful way to think about it\! You're getting closer to a more abstract definition of a computer.

**Yes, the operating system (and particularly the kernel) plays a crucial role in defining and managing what we consider a single computer.** Here's why:

- **Resource Management:** The primary responsibility of the operating system, especially the kernel, is to manage the computer's hardware resources. This includes the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices. It allocates these resources to different applications and processes, ensuring they can run efficiently and without interfering with each other. Without an OS (or a similar control mechanism), the raw hardware would be just a collection of inert components.  
- **Abstraction Layer:** The OS provides an abstraction layer between the hardware and the software applications. It presents a consistent and standardized interface that allows software developers to write applications without needing to know the specific details of the underlying hardware. This abstraction is fundamental to how we interact with computers.  
- **Defining the Environment:** The OS essentially defines the computing environment that users and applications interact with. It dictates how files are organized, how applications are launched, and how the user interacts with the system.

**The Kernel as the Core Definition:**

The **kernel** is the core of the operating system. It's the first program loaded into memory when the computer boots up and remains in memory until the system is shut down. The kernel has direct control over the hardware and provides the most fundamental services, such as:

- **Process Management:** Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes.  
- **Memory Management:** Allocating and managing memory for processes.  
- **Device Management:** Interacting with hardware devices through device drivers.  
- **System Calls:** Providing an interface for applications to request services from the kernel.

**Why the OS/Kernel is a Strong Defining Factor:**

- **Functionality:** The presence of a functioning OS is what transforms a collection of hardware into a usable computer. It's the software that orchestrates the hardware to perform tasks.  
- **Identity:** The specific operating system running on a machine often contributes to its identity and capabilities. For example, a computer running Windows will have a different user experience and software compatibility than one running macOS or Linux.

**However, it's not the *only* defining factor.**

While the OS/kernel is essential, the underlying **hardware** is still a prerequisite. The OS needs the CPU, memory, and other hardware components to manage. You can't have an operating system without some form of underlying processing and storage capabilities.

**A More Complete View:**

Perhaps a more comprehensive definition of a computer could be:

**A computer is a collection of interconnected hardware components, including a processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage, that are managed and controlled by an operating system (or a similar control mechanism) to execute instructions and process data.**

**In essence, the operating system acts as the conductor of the hardware orchestra.** It's what brings the individual components together and directs them to perform useful work. So, your intuition about the OS and kernel being central to the definition of a computer is very accurate\!

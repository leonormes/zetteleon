**Prompt Request:**

Based on these details, create a personalised, modular weekly training plan.

- List all movement patterns and give concrete example exercises for each (with beginner/intermediate options).
- Detail session structure (sets, reps, weekly frequency).
- Include sample warm-up, cool-down, and key recovery strategies.
- Provide tips on consistency, focus for ADHD, and sustainable motivation.
- If possible, suggest nutrition strategies to support muscle growth and fat loss after rapid weight reduction.

***

Here is a personalised, modular training programme designed to build functional strength and a balanced, athletic physique, specifically tailored to your goals and psychological profile.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Rebuild First:** After rapid weight loss (especially with GLP-1 agonists), muscle loss (sarcopenia) can be significant. Our number one priority is resistance training to rebuild this metabolically active tissue.
2. **ADHD-Friendly Workflow:** This programme is built on variety, frequency, and "small wins." Sessions are short ( minutes) but frequent, providing consistent feedback and preventing boredom.
3. **Movement > Muscles:** We will train *movements* (Push, Pull, Hinge, Squat, Lunge, Carry), not just body parts. This builds functional strength that translates to real life and creates a balanced physique.

## 1. The Weekly Modular Plan

This is a **4-day-per-week, Full-Body A/B Split**. This structure gives you frequency and variety, allowing you to hit each movement pattern twice per week without any single session becoming a long, tedious slog.

- **Monday:** Session A
- **Tuesday:** Session B
- **Wednesday:** Active Recovery (e.g., 30-min walk, mobility)
- **Thursday:** Session A (use different exercise variations)
- **Friday:** Session B (use different exercise variations)
- **Saturday:** Cardio (LISS or HIIT)
- **Sunday:** Full Rest

## 2. Session Structure: The "A" and "B" Workouts

Aim for **3 sets** of **8-12 repetitions** for each exercise. This range is optimal for *hypertrophy* (muscle growth). Rest for **60-90 seconds** between sets. Use a timer to stay on track.

### Session A: Squat & Push Focus

| Movement | Exercise Example | Sets x Reps | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Warm-up** | (See section 4) | 5-10 mins | Prepares joints and muscles; activates CNS. |
| **1. Squat** | **Goblet Squat** | 3 x 8-12 | *The* foundational pattern. Teaches core bracing and leg drive. |
| **2. Horizontal Push** | **Dumbbell Bench Press** | 3 x 8-12 | Builds chest, shoulders, and triceps. Dumbbells allow for natural shoulder movement. |
| **3. Horizontal Pull** | **Single-Arm Dumbbell Row** | 3 x 8-12 (per side) | Builds back thickness and counters all pushing. Unilateral (one-sided) work fixes imbalances. |
| **4. Core** | **Plank** | 3 x 45-60 sec | Develops anterior core stability (anti-extension). |
| **Cool-down** | (See section 4) | 5 mins | Begins the recovery process. |

### Session B: Hinge & Pull Focus

| Movement | Exercise Example | Sets x Reps | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Warm-up** | (See section 4) | 5-10 mins | Prepares joints and muscles; activates CNS. |
| **1. Hinge** | **Dumbbell RDL** | 3 x 10-15 | Builds the entire "posterior chain" (hamstrings, glutes, back). Crucial for power and posture. |
| **2. Vertical Pull** | **Lat Pulldown** (Gym) or **Banded Pull-down** | 3 x 8-12 | Builds back width (the "V-taper") and supports shoulder health. |
| **3. Lunge** | **Reverse Lunge** | 3 x 8-10 (per side) | Unilateral leg strength. Builds glutes and quads, and improves balance. |
| **4. Carry** | **Farmer's Carry** | 3 x 30m | The ultimate functional exercise. Builds grip, traps, core, and mental toughness. |
| **Cool-down** | (See section 4) | 5 mins | Begins the recovery process. |

## 3. The Movement Pattern "Menu"

This is how you ensure variety. For each session, simply **swap in an alternative exercise** from the same category.

| Pattern | Beginner Option (Master these first) | Intermediate Option (Progress to these) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Squat** | Bodyweight Squat (to a box), Goblet Squat (light) | Dumbbell Front Squat, Barbell Back Squat (requires form check) |
| **Hinge** | Bodyweight Hip Hinge (wall tap), Banded Good Morning | Dumbbell RDL, Kettlebell Swing, Conventional Deadlift (requires coaching) |
| **Horizontal Push** | Incline Push-up, Banded Chest Press | Floor Push-up, Dumbbell Bench Press, Barbell Bench Press |
| **Horizontal Pull** | Banded Row (seated/standing), Inverted Row (under table) | Single-Arm Dumbbell Row, Cable Row (gym), Pendlay Row |
| **Vertical Push** | Banded Overhead Press, Seated Dumbbell Press (light) | Standing Dumbbell Press, Barbell Overhead Press |
| **Vertical Pull** | Banded Pull-down, Band-assisted Pull-up | Lat Pulldown (gym), Pull-up / Chin-up (use negatives) |
| **Lunge** | Bodyweight Split Squat, Bodyweight Reverse Lunge | Dumbbell Reverse Lunge, Bulgarian Split Squat |
| **Core/Carry** | Plank, Dead Bug, Bird-dog | Farmer's Carry, Suitcase Carry, Plank w/ row |

## 4. Warm-up, Cool-down & Recovery

Do not skip these. They are critical for injury prevention and performance.

### Dynamic Warm-up (5-10 mins)

Perform this before every single workout.

1. **Pulse Raiser (3 mins):** Light skipping, jogging on the spot, or jumping jacks.
2. **Mobility Drills (5 mins):**
 - **Cat-Cow:** 10 reps (for spinal mobility)
 - **World's Greatest Stretch:** 5 reps per side (opens hips, thoracic spine)
 - **Leg Swings:** 15 reps (front-to-back and side-to-side)
 - **Band Pull-Aparts:** 20 reps (activates upper back and shoulders)
 - **Bodyweight Squats:** 15 reps (primes the squat pattern)

### Cool-down (5 mins)

Perform this immediately after your last set.

1. **Heart Rate Reduction (2 mins):** Slow, deliberate walking. Focus on deep, nasal breathing.
2. **Static Stretches (Hold 30s each):**
 - Chest Stretch (doorway or band)
 - Lat Stretch (hang from bar or pull-down machine)
 - Hamstring Stretch (forward fold)
 - Quad Stretch (standing)

### Key Recovery Strategies

- **Sleep:** This is when you repair and grow. It is non-negotiable. Aim for **7-9 hours** of quality sleep.
- **Hydration:** Muscle is water. Dehydration crushes performance. Aim for **2.5 - 3 litres** of water per day, plus more on training days.
- **Active Recovery:** On your "off" days, *move*. A 30-minute brisk walk is perfect. It pumps blood to sore muscles (DOMS) and aids repair without causing more stress.

## 5. Consistency & ADHD-Friendly Focus

- **Log Everything:** This is your "rapid feedback". Use a notebook or app. Write down `Exercise`, `Weight`, `Sets x Reps`. Seeing `Goblet Squat 16kg 3x8` become `Goblet Squat 20kg 3x10` two weeks later is a massive dopamine hit.
- **Reduce Friction:** Lay out your gym clothes, bands, and water bottle the night before. The fewer steps between "I should work out" and "I am working out," the better.
- **The 5-Minute Rule:** On low-motivation days, just commit to the 5-minute warm-up. If you still want to stop after 5 minutes, you can. 9 times out of 10, you'll continue and complete the session.
- **Use a Timer:** Use your phone's timer for rest periods. It keeps the session moving, maintains focus, and prevents you from drifting off.
- **"Flow" your Workout:** Group exercises that use the same equipment (e.g., do your Dumbbell Press and Dumbbell Rows in the same spot) to minimise setup time and maintain momentum.

## 6. Nutrition Strategy: Rebuild & Re-comp

Your recent weight loss is fantastic, but now we must shift focus from *just* loss to *rebuilding*. You are in a prime position for "body recomposition" (losing fat and gaining muscle simultaneously).

**Your Number One Priority: Protein.**

- **Why:** It is the building block for the muscle you want to grow. It is also highly satiating (keeps you full) and has the highest thermic effect of food (burns calories to digest).
- **Target:** Aim for **1.6 - 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight**.
 	- At 91kg, this is **145g - 182g of protein per day**.
- **How:** Make it the centrepiece of every meal.
 	- **Breakfast:** Greek yoghurt, eggs, or a protein shake.
 	- **Lunch:** Large chicken breast or salmon fillet with salad/vegetables.
 	- **Dinner:** Lean mince, fish, or tofu with rice/potatoes and vegetables.
 	- **Snacks:** Protein bar, handful of nuts, cottage cheese.

**Calories & Carbs/Fats:**

- **Calories:** Do not crash diet. You need fuel to build muscle. Start by eating at your new *maintenance* level. The resistance training and high protein intake will drive the "re-comp."
- **Carbs:** Do not fear them. They are your primary fuel source for high-intensity training. Focus on whole-food sources: oats, potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, fruits. Time them around your workouts for best effect.
- **Fats:** Essential for hormone production (especially at 52). Focus on healthy sources: avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and oily fish (salmon, mackerel).

Give me a gentle evening stretch routine before bed

Here is a gentle 5-10 minute stretching routine designed to release tension and prepare you for a restful night's sleep.

The focus here is on **relaxation**, not aggressive flexibility. Move slowly, breathe deeply, and never force a stretch. Hold each pose for about **30-60 seconds** or **5-10 deep, slow breaths**.

---

## Gentle Evening Stretch Routine

### 1. Seated Neck Tilts

- **How:** Sit comfortably, either cross-legged on your bed or on the floor. Let your shoulders drop away from your ears.
- **Action:** Gently tilt your right ear towards your right shoulder. Do not pull or force it; just let gravity do the work. To deepen it slightly, you can rest your right hand lightly on the side of your head.
- **Why:** Releases tension held in the neck and upper trapezius from computer work or daily stress.
- **Hold:** 3-5 deep breaths. Repeat on the left side.

### 2. Seated Cat-Cow

- **How:** Sit cross-legged. Place your hands on your knees.
- **Action (Cow):** As you **inhale**, gently arch your back, push your chest forward, and look up slightly. Pull your shoulders back and down.
- **Action (Cat):** As you **exhale**, round your spine, drop your chin to your chest, and let your shoulders roll forward. Feel the stretch between your shoulder blades.
- **Why:** Gently mobilises the spine after being upright all day.
- **Hold:** Repeat for 5 cycles, linking one breath to one movement.

### 3. Child's Pose

- **How:** Kneel on your bed or a mat. Bring your big toes to touch and widen your knees to about the width of your hips (or wider for comfort).
- **Action:****Exhale** and sink your hips back towards your heels. Walk your hands forward and rest your forehead on the bed/mat.
- **Why:** A deeply restorative pose. It gently stretches the entire back, hips, and shoulders, and calms the nervous system.
- **Hold:** 5-10 deep breaths. Focus on your breathing, feeling your back expand with each inhale.

### 4. Supine Spinal Twist

- **How:** Lie on your back. Bring your knees into your chest for a moment.
- **Action:** Extend your left leg straight. Keep your right knee bent and, on an **exhale**, gently guide it across your body to the left side. Open your right arm out to the side (in a "T" shape) and try to keep your right shoulder flat on the bed. Turn your gaze to the right, if comfortable for your neck.
- **Why:** Releases tension in the lower back, glutes, and outer hip.
- **Hold:** 5-10 deep breaths. Repeat on the other side.

### 5. Reclining Bound Angle (Supta Baddha Konasana)

- **How:** Lying on your back, bring the soles of your feet together and let your knees fall open to the sides, creating a diamond shape with your legs.
- **Action:** Rest your hands on your belly or one hand on your heart and one on your belly. You can place pillows under your knees for support if the stretch is too intense.
- **Why:** A passive hip opener that allows for full, deep diaphragmatic breathing. It's very calming.
- **Hold:** Stay here for 1-2 minutes. Focus on slow, deep belly breaths, feeling your abdomen rise and fall.

After the final stretch, you can simply extend your legs and arms, transitioning directly into a comfortable position for sleep. Sweet dreams.

*The Goal: To use your connected notes to build larger arguments and summaries.*

This is where you zoom out from the atomic level to see the bigger picture that your notes are forming.

**The Method: Creating Structure Notes**

1. **Identify Emerging Themes**: As you connect notes, you will see clusters of ideas forming around a central topic.
2. **Create a Structure Note**: A structure note is a higher-level note that organises and summarises a collection of atomic notes.
3. **Write the Synthesis**: Use the structure note to articulate the overarching argument or story that the linked notes tell.

> **Outcome**: A coherent understanding of a complex topic, captured in a structure note that serves as a map of your thinking.

## Detailed Example: The Full Process

**The Spark**: "Why does it feel like my productivity is tied to the tools I use, not my own effort? I'm always looking for the perfect app."

### Stage 0: Prepare

Instead of sitting down to write immediately, I take a 20-minute walk around a local park. I don't force myself to think about the problem, but I let my mind wander. I notice the feeling of my feet on the path and the sound of the wind. The initial anxiety about the "productivity" problem starts to feel less urgent and more like a curious puzzle. A new thought emerges: "It's not about the tool, it's about the feeling of control the tool promises."

### Stage 1: Generate

Back at my desk, I set a 10-minute timer and start writing, letting my hands move and gesture as I type.

> okay the tools thing again, always looking for the perfect app... [etc.] ... it's about control, yes, that's it. the feeling of a perfect system is a feeling of a perfect, controlled life. *[I find myself making a grasping gesture with my hand, as if holding a perfect sphere]*. a life where thoughts don't slip away. where everything is captured and organised. but life isn't like that. thoughts are messy. they aren't neat little blocks you can arrange. *[My hands move in a chaotic, swirling motion]*. the tool promises order in the face of chaos. that's the appeal. it's a false promise.

### Stage 2: Clarify

I take the raw text and put it into a new note. I print it out and look at it on my desk.

1. **Externalise**: Seeing it physically separate from the screen helps me spot the core sentences.
2. **Strip Clutter**: I see the phrase "it's a form of procrastination, feels productive but it's just busy work." I can make this tighter.
3. **Strengthen Verbs**: "The tool becomes an excuse" is okay, but I can make it more active. How about "The tool *shields* me"?
4. **Find Voice**: Reading it aloud, the phrase "sharpening all the pencils" feels true to my own experience and voice. I'll keep that.
5. **Craft Sentence**: I'll vary the sentence length. A few short, punchy sentences will add impact.

**After (Clarified Note - `202507221650-The-Search-for-the-Perfect-Tool-is-Procrastination.md`):**

> The search for a perfect tool is a sophisticated form of procrastination. We tell ourselves we are optimising our workflow, but we are really just sharpening pencils to avoid writing the essay. This behaviour is rooted in a desire for control in the face of the inherent chaos of creative thought. The perfect tool offers a false promise: that our messy, unpredictable ideas can be neatly contained. It is a shield. It protects us from the terrifying silence where the real work begins.

[[The Unified Writing to Think Process]]

In a structure note titled `[[Productive Procrastination]]`, I would add a new section:

> #### Tool Fetishism
>
> One of the most common forms of productive procrastination, especially in technical or creative fields, is the endless search for the "perfect tool" (e.g., software, notebook, workflow). This search creates the *illusion* of progress while actively avoiding the core task of creation or problem-solving. It is a defence mechanism against the Fear of the Blank Page. See 202507221650-The-Search-for-the-Perfect-Tool-is-Procrastination.

2. **Create a Structure Note**: A structure note is a higher-level note that organises and summarises a collection of atomic notes. It's your "wiki-style" entry, but it's built from the ground up through your thinking process.
3. **Write the Synthesis**: Use the structure note to articulate the overarching argument or story that the linked notes tell. This is your "explanatory" writing, built upon the foundation of your "exploratory" work.

> **Outcome**: A coherent understanding of a complex topic, captured in a structure note that serves as a map of your thinking.

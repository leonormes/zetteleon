Okay, let's break down this learning approach and explore potential connections to ADHD.

What you're describing is a very effective, albeit sometimes time-consuming, way of learning often referred to as **top-down learning**, **contextual learning**, or **systems thinking**.

1. **Top-Down Learning:** Instead of starting with the smallest details and building up (bottom-up), you start with a specific area (Kubernetes networking) and then seek the broader context or foundational principles it relies upon (general networking, Linux fundamentals like namespaces). You're essentially asking "What larger system is this a part of?" or "What underlying principles make this possible?".
2. **Contextual Learning:** You grasp information better when you understand its place within a larger framework. Knowing *why* something exists (the problem Linux namespaces solve) makes understanding *how* it's used (in containers for Kubernetes networking) much easier. The context provides hooks for the new information to attach to in your mind.
3. **Systems Thinking:** You're naturally inclined to see how different parts of a system interact and depend on each other. You recognised that Kubernetes networking isn't magic; it relies on underlying operating system features (Linux namespaces), which themselves are part of a broader concept (OS design, process isolation), which relate to fundamental computer science principles.

Your own analysis is spot on: "Understanding the bigger picture helps," "Understanding the problem makes the solution easier to comprehend," and "see the big picture so I can place the sub topics in context." This desire for context and foundational understanding is the core of this approach.

**Why Might an ADHD Brain Gravitate Towards This?**

While it's crucial to remember that ADHD manifests differently in everyone and this isn't a diagnosis, there are several common traits associated with ADHD that could encourage this learning style:

1. **Need for Meaning and Context:** Individuals with ADHD often struggle with tasks or information that seems arbitrary or lacks clear relevance. Rote memorisation or learning isolated facts without understanding the "why" can be incredibly difficult and demotivating. Your approach actively seeks out that "why" and the broader context, making the information meaningful and therefore more engaging and easier to retain.
2. **Interest-Driven Attention & Hyperfocus:** When something captures your interest (like figuring out the fundamental technology behind Kubernetes), the ADHD brain can often engage in periods of intense concentration, or hyperfocus. Following the trail from Kubernetes networking up the hierarchy to Linux namespaces can be highly stimulating and rewarding, tapping into this interest-driven attention system.
3. **Dopamine Seeking:** The ADHD brain is often described as having differences in its dopamine pathways, leading to a drive for novelty, stimulation, and reward. The process of discovery – uncovering the underlying principles, making connections, having those "aha\!" moments when you see how things fit together – provides rewarding dopamine hits that reinforce this exploratory learning behaviour. It feels more like solving a fascinating puzzle than completing a rote learning task.
4. **Non-Linear Thinking:** ADHD is often associated with non-linear, associative thinking patterns. Your brain might naturally jump between connected concepts rather than following a strictly linear path. Exploring the hierarchy allows you to follow these connections organically, moving from the specific application (k8s) to the general principle (namespaces) and back again as understanding grows.
5. **Difficulty with "Just Because":** Being told "You need to learn Kubernetes networking" might be less compelling than discovering *how* it works at a fundamental level. The investigation satisfies curiosity and provides a deeper, more satisfying understanding than simply accepting the surface-level explanation.

**In Summary:**
Your learning style is a form of top-down, contextual learning driven by a desire to understand the underlying principles and the bigger picture. This is a powerful way to gain deep understanding, particularly in complex technical fields.
This approach might be particularly well-suited to or encouraged by certain aspects often associated with ADHD, such as the need for context and meaning, the ability to hyperfocus on interesting problems, the rewarding nature of discovery (dopamine), and non-linear thinking patterns. You're essentially building a robust mental framework first, which then makes it easier to slot in and understand the specific details. It's a valid and often highly effective strategy.

### Highlights

- That’s the kind of thing that gets me excited: how to take all that complexity and come up with a system of objects that can make the problem more tractable. Indeed, I believe that the primary benefit of objects is in making complex logic tractable. Developing a good Domain Model (116) for a complex business problem is difficult but wonderfully satisfying. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=275))
- Then there’s the matter of what comes under the term “business logic.” I find this a curious term because there are few things that are less logical than business logic. When you build an operating system you strive to keep the whole thing logical. But business rules are just given to you, and without major political effort there’s nothing you can do to change them. You have to deal with a haphazard array of strange conditions that often interact with each other in surprising ways. Of course, they got that way for a reason: Some salesman negotiated to have a certain yearly payment two days later than usual because that fit with his customer’s accounting cycle and thus won a couple of million dollars in business. A few thousand of these one-off special cases is what leads to the complex business “illogic” that makes business software so difficult. In this situation you have to organize the business logic as effectively as you can, because the only certain thing is that the logic will change over time. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=472))
  - Note: Business rules and logic can be weird and wonderful. It is sometimes very difficult to put business 'logic' into logical rules!
- Latency is the minimum time required to get any form of response, even if the work to be done is nonexistent. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=543))
- Throughput is how much stuff you can do in a given amount of time. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=548))
- Load sensitivity is an expression of how the response time varies with the load. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=556))
- Efficiency is performance divided by resources. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=559))
- Scalability is a measure of how adding resources (usually hardware) affects performance. A scalable system is one that allows you to add hardware and get a commensurate performance improvement, such as doubling how many servers you have to double your throughput. Vertical scalability, or scaling up, means adding more power to a single server, such as more memory. Horizontal scalability, or scaling out, means adding more servers. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=562))
- Money is a Value Object (486), so it should have its equality and hash code operations overridden to be based on the currency and amount. ([Location 9146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008OHVDFM&location=9146))

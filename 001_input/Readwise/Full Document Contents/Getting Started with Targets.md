- Summary: YNAB targets help you save or refill money for expenses on monthly, yearly, or custom schedules. You choose a behavior (set aside, refill, or have a balance) to control how the target repeats and funds. Use targets to plan regular bills, one-time goals, or irregular expenses and track progress.

#### Monthly Targets

Assign and spend up to this set amount each month. This target period follows a calendar month. When the month changes, this target will repeat.

When you set the target up, you’ll choose its behavior. By choosing its behavior, you'll know what to expect when the target repeats next month.

**With the “Set aside another...” behavior**, the target will prompt you to assign the full amount of the monthly target again. Money will build up in the category over time. With this option, money will build up in the category over time.

* Example: Assign $100 each month towards future home maintenance needs.
* Category examples: Rent, mortgage, auto maintenance, home repairs, medical expenses, investment account contributions, building up a savings category, or any other set expense that happens each month.

**With the "Refill up to..." behavior**, the target will prompt you to refill any funds that left the category in the previous month, up to that month's target amount. With this option, you'll only assign enough to fill the category up to the target amount.

* Example: Assign $100 for fuel each month, and spend up to $100. If there is money left over, apply that toward next month's target.
* Category examples: Utilities, dining out, gas/fuel, transportation, discretionary spending, or any expense where you want to spend **up to** an amount on a monthly basis.

#### Yearly Targets

Assign and spend up to this set amount for a yearly expense. With yearly targets, you decide when the first target period ends by selecting a "first due on" date. You can save up for the first yearly expense, even if you start the target less than a year before its due. Once the first due date month has passed, the target will repeat annually based on that “first due on” date.

When you set the target up, you’ll choose its behavior. By choosing its behavior, you'll know what to expect when the target repeats next year.

**With the "Set aside another..." behavior**, the target will prompt you to assign the full amount of the yearly target again. This works well when you want to save up for an expense the month before it's due, and then start saving again for next year.

* Example: Assign $600 for taxes by next year and the target will ask you for $50 each month.
* Category examples: Yearly subscriptions, medical expenses, taxes, and any set yearly expense.

**With the "Refill up to..." behavior**, the target will prompt you to refill any funds that left the category in the previous year, up to that months target amount. With this option, you'll only assign enough to fill the category back up to the target amount.

* Example: Assign $1,200 for gifts by next year and the target will ask you for $100 each month.
* Category examples: Gifts, birthdays, home improvement, insurance payments, any variable expense you want to spend **up to** an amount on a yearly basis.

Since there can only be one target in a category in a single month, the new target period will start the month **after** the previous one ends. This is true even if the target due date is before the end of the month.

#### Custom Targets

Assign and spend up to this amount by a given date. YNAB will prompt you to assign a certain amount each month to stay on track to meet the target amount. The custom section gives you more options for tracking progress. You can choose whether you want the target to repeat or not, and how often.

When you set the target up, you’ll choose its behavior. By choosing its behavior, you'll know what to expect when the target repeats. Custom target behaviors are slightly different than the options you have for weekly, monthly, and yearly targets.

**With the "Set aside..." behavior**, the target will prompt you to assign the full target amount by the due date, just like weekly, monthly, and yearly targets do. You can choose to repeat this target at a variety of cadences, or not at all. If the target repeats, you'll choose whether to "set aside another..." or "refill up to..." the target amount.

* Example: Assign $300 every six months for your twice-yearly car insurance payment. The target will ask you for $50 each month and reset every six months.
* Category examples: Vacations, home improvement projects, a new baby, one-time or repeating expenses that don’t repeat monthly or yearly, where you’ll need to spend as you go.

Just like yearly targets, you decide when the first target period ends by selecting a "first due on" date. You can save up for the first expense, even if you start the target only a month before its first due. Once the first due date month has passed, the target will repeat at the cadence you’ve chosen, based on that “first due on” date.

**With the "Have a balance of..." behavior**, you can choose whether or not you'd like to set a due date. If you choose a due date, the target will prompt you to assign money so the Available balance of the category matches the target amount by the due date. This target does not repeat, and it's not meant to be spent from before it's due. It's best for large, one-time expenses.

* Example: Set a target to have $10,000 set aside for a house down payment.
* Category examples: house down payment, new car, new furniture, one-time medical expenses, computer replacement, or other large one-time purchases.

In the realm of information and communication, a **signal** is fundamentally a carrier of information. It acts as a means to convey data or a message from one point (the sender or transmitter) to another (the receiver) through a communication channel.  
Essentially, a signal is a physical quantity that varies with time, space, or another independent variable, where this variation is used to represent information. This can take many forms, including:

- An electrical current or voltage (e.g., in telephone lines or electronic circuits)  
- An electromagnetic wave (e.g., radio waves, microwaves, light)  
- A sound wave (e.g., spoken words)  
- A visual cue (e.g., gestures, traffic lights)  
- A sequence of states or symbols (e.g., digital data)

**From a high-level abstraction:**  
At its most fundamental and abstract level, a signal is the **representation of information in transit**. It's the conceptual embodiment of the message itself, distinct from the specific physical medium or the intricate details of how that information is encoded or modulated.  
Think of it as:

- **The core message:** The "what" is being communicated, rather than the "how." For instance, the abstract idea of "stop" is conveyed by a red traffic light signal, regardless of whether the light is an LED or an incandescent bulb.  
- **An event or piece of information:** It signifies that some information is being passed. For example, a "new email" notification is a signal, abstracting away the underlying network protocols and data packets.  
- **A change in state:** A signal often represents a change that carries meaning. A doorbell ringing signals someone is at the door; the ringing itself is the signal, and the information is the presence of a visitor.

This high-level abstraction allows us to discuss and analyse communication systems by focusing on the flow and processing of information, without immediately getting bogged down in the specific physical characteristics or technological implementations of every signal. It helps in understanding the fundamental principles of how information is encoded, transmitted, and decoded.

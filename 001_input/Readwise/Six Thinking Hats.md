### Highlights

- Thinking is the ultimate human resource. Yet we can never be satisfied with our most important skill. No matter how good we become, we should always want to be better. Usually, the only people who are very satisfied with their thinking skill are those poor thinkers who believe that the purpose of thinking is to prove yourself right – to your own satisfaction. If we have only a limited view of what thinking can do, we may be smug about our excellence in this area, but not otherwise.

- Each of the six thinking hats has a colour: white, red, black, yellow, green, blue. The colour provides the name for the hat. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=307))
- White Hat White is neutral and objective. The white hat is concerned with objective facts and figures. ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=312))
- Red Hat Red suggests anger (seeing red), rage and emotions. The red hat gives the emotional view. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=314))
- Black Hat Black is sombre and serious. The black hat is cautious and careful. It points out the weaknesses in an idea. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=315))
- Blue Hat Blue is cool, and it is also the colour of the sky, which is above everything else. The blue hat is concerned with control, the organization of the thinking process and the use of the other hats. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=318))
- If you remember the colour and the associations of each hat, remembering the function of the hat will then follow. You may also think of three pairs of hats: White and red Black and yellow Green and blue ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=320))

#### THE WHITE HAT

- Think of paper. Think of a computer printout. The white hat is about information. When the white hat is in use, everyone focuses directly and exclusively on information. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=436))
- What information do we have? What information do we need? What information is missing? What questions do we need to ask? How are we going to get the information we need? ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=437))
- The white hat is neutral. The white hat reports on the world. The white hat is not for generating ideas though it is permissible to report on ideas that are in use or have been suggested. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=445))
- A very important part of the white hat is to define the information that is missing and needed. The white hat defines the questions that should be asked. The white hat lays out the means (such as surveys and questionnaires) for obtaining the needed information. White hat energy is directed at seeking out and laying out information. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=447))

##### Facts and Figures

- Unfortunately, Western thinking, with its argument habits, prefers to give a conclusion first and then to bring in the facts to support that conclusion. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=461))
- In contrast, in the map-making type of thinking that I am advocating, we have to make the map first and then choose the route. That means that we have to have the facts and figures first. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=462))
- The point of this story is that it is possible to reply to a request for facts and figures with so much information that the asker is overwhelmed by the amount. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=471))
- In this sense white hat thinking becomes a discipline which encourages the thinker to separate quite clearly in his or her own mind what is fact and what is extrapolation or interpretation. It might be imagined that politicians would have considerable difficulty with white hat thinking. ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=512))

##### Whose Fact Is It

- The important point is the use to which the facts are to be put. Before we act upon a fact or make it the basis for a decision, we do need to check it. So we assess which of the believed facts could be useful and then proceed to try to verify it. For example, if the believed quietness of the Boeing 757 is vital to the siting of an airport, then we certainly need to take that from the ‘believed’ status to the ‘checked’ status. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=530))
- Let me repeat that we do definitely need the belief tier because the tentative, the hypothetical and the provocative are essential for thinking. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=535))
- Let me say at once that your own opinion is never permissible under white hat thinking. That would destroy the whole purpose of the white hat. You can, of course, report the actual opinion of someone else. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=539))
- You might prefer to have the two tiers as 1 checked fact, and 2 unchecked fact (belief). ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073RW3RPJ&location=543))

### Highlights

- Quick fixes are solutions that produce short-run benefits, which are typically neutralized or eroded by longer-run consequences of the same actions. Short-term small successes are improvements that are planned from the beginning with the long term in mind and are vital to encouraging persistence and maintaining momentum. This distinction will become clearer when we look at leverage points and strategic planning in greater detail, but these basics will help as we further explore systems plots.

- In many cases the best way to reduce the likelihood of Fixes That Backfire is to solve the underlying problem that produces the symptoms. People often recognize that a more fundamental solution is desirable, but then wonder why it is so difficult to implement. One of the key reasons is that addressing the root cause of the problem takes longer, is more expensive, and can entail more risk and uncertainty.

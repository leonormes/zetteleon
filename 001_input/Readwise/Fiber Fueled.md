### Highlights

- Simply put, the greatest determinant of your health during your lifetime is the food that you choose to eat. As it turns out, your diet is also the greatest determinant of the health of your microbiome. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=208))
- There are five types of microorganisms residing within you. They include bacteria, yeasts, parasites, viruses, and archaea. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=356))
- Depending on how you look at it, some would say you are only 10 percent human—and 90 percent bacteria! You’re not just human, you’re a superorganism that serves as an ecosystem for four of the six kingdoms of life: Eubacteria, Fungi, Archaebacteria, and Protista. The other two are Animalia (us) and plantae (what we eat). We are more than just human. We are the circle of life. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=384))
- But you control what it is you bite into, and therefore you control the makeup of your microbiome. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=403))
  - Note: I feel this is not as straightforward as it sounds. Although i have no idea what I'm talking about i think the microbieme had some day in what we crave
- That’s not the only thing we rely on them for. What’s cool is that the health effects extend far beyond the walls of the colon. If I were to boldly define the entirety of human health, there would be five essential elements: immunity, metabolism, hormonal balance, cognition, and gene expression. That ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=413))
- By ignoring the cause we will never get to the root of the problem. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=813))
- Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) to the rescue ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=1123))
- Finally, children on a high-fiber diet demonstrate better cognitive control (multitasking, working memory, and maintaining focus) than children who eat a lower-fiber diet. So SCFAs may help ADHD. I’d far rather kids eat a salad than take Ritalin. ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=1335))
- What this means is that plant-based diversity in your diet will not happen by accident. It happens by making this your core dietary philosophy, shunning the path that our food system wants you to take. The good news is that in the pages that follow I’m going to help you maximize your plant-based diversity as a celebration of nature’s bounty. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=1406))
- Studies keep showing that the complex carbohydrates you’ll find in whole fruits, veggies, legumes, and whole grains are anything but inflammatory. They’re actually anti-inflammatory. But we rely on our gut microbiome to process them, and if there’s damage to the gut then it’s also impaired in carbohydrate processing, which leads to digestive distress. That’s not inflammation, that’s just sloppy processing. It doesn’t hurt you beyond the acute symptoms. ([Location 1850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=1850))
- You can’t get to postbiotics without prebiotics. And you can’t optimize plant-based diversity by getting all of your fiber from a supplement. It just doesn’t work that way. It’s time to move past “biohacking” and realize that there are no shortcuts. ([Location 2395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=2395))
- Pro Tip: Blueberries Opt for the smaller blueberries, ideally wild. Smaller blueberries are less sweet but have higher levels of antioxidants. ([Location 2561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=2561))
- These omega-3 and -6 fats are polyunsaturated fats, and they’re considered “essential” because our body is not capable of intrinsically making them so we are required to get them ([Location 2609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=2609))
- Generally speaking, polyunsaturated fats are considered healthy and are important for many functions in the body. ([Location 2611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZY7J2XW&location=2611))

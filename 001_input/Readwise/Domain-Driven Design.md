### Highlights

- Leading software designers have recognized domain modeling and design as critical topics for at least 20 years, yet surprisingly little has been written about what needs to be done or how to do it. Although it has never been formulated clearly, a philosophy has emerged as an undercurrent in the object community, a philosophy I call domain-driven design.

  - Note: DDD has always been present in the minds of system designers but Evans is making it clear in his book
- Their first release had ossified prematurely into a high-maintenance legacy. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00794TAUG&location=341))
- Yet the most significant complexity of many applications is not technical. It is in the domain itself, the activity or business of the user. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00794TAUG&location=364))
- A successful design must systematically deal with this central aspect of the software. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00794TAUG&location=366))
  - Note: Evans claim is that a successful project must handle the domain complexity
- This book is not tied to a particular methodology, but it is oriented toward the new family of “Agile development processes.” Specifically, it assumes that a couple of practices are in place on the project. These two practices are prerequisites for applying the approach in this book. 1. Development is iterative. Iterative development has been advocated and practiced for decades, and it is a cornerstone of Agile development methods. There are many good discussions in the literature of Agile development and Extreme Programming (or XP), among them, Surviving Object-Oriented Projects (Cockburn 1998) and Extreme Programming Explained (Beck 1999). 2. Developers and domain experts have a close relationship. Domain-driven design crunches a huge amount of knowledge into a model that reflects deep insight into the domain and a focus on the key concepts. This is a collaboration between those who know the domain and those who know how to build software. Because development is iterative, this collaboration must continue throughout the project’s life.

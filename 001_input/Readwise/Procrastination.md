### Highlights

- A good example of this is the immediate and negative impact procrastinating can have on your mood. People who procrastinate donʼt feel joy or pride when they put things off. Numerous studies have shown that, instead, people who procrastinate can feel a range of negative emotions, from guilt and shame to anxiety and self-loathing (e.g., Flett et al., 1995). We delve more into how and why negative emotions are implicated in procrastination starting in Chapter 5. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y17YXV2&location=407))
- “Procrastination is a form of self-regulation failure that involves prioritizing short-term mood repair over the long-term pursuit of intended actions.” ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y17YXV2&location=610))
- A central theme in this definition is the idea that procrastination involves putting more importance on trying to repair or change your immediate mood than simply getting on with what needs to get done. In short, we procrastinate to avoid the negative feelings associated with a task, but we do so at the expense of following through and completing our task.

- Tomorrow is a mystical land where 99 percent of all human productivity, motivation, and achievement is stored. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y17YXV2&location=629))

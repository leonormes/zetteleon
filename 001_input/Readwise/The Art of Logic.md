### Highlights

- There are two ways to make something simpler – we can forget parts of it, or we can become cleverer so that things that used to seem incomprehensible become clear to us. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078WFMLYS&location=83))
  - Note: The system we are developing is complex and we can either forget bits to fit it in our heads or we can just get smarter.
- All areas of research and study are concerned with uncovering truths about the world. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078WFMLYS&location=92))
  - Note: Truth can't just be evidence. Who says the evidence is solid?

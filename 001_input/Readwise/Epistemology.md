### Metadata

- Author: [[Robert M. Martin]]

### Highlights

- A belief that’s just a hunch or a guess doesn’t carry with it a great likelihood of being true, no matter how strongly it’s held. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00L1EP1RG&location=422))
  - Note: Being true is context dependent. On some level it is true that I am holding a Google phone. But on a quantum level it is just energy, particles and probability.

- Summary: Timeboxing is a time management strategy that helps you stay focused and reduce procrastination by assigning a specific amount of time to each task. This method can improve productivity by encouraging you to complete tasks within a set timeframe, whether through "hard" or "soft" timeboxes. It’s a flexible tool that can help both individuals and teams organize their work effectively.

### Highlights

- Before creating a timebox, you first need to decide if it’s a hard or a soft timebox. A hard timebox means your task or activity must stop when your timebox is up—even if you haven’t completed the task. Creating hard timeboxes can be particularly helpful if you're prone to perfectionism and you frequently toil over work that’s already been completed. In a team setting, creating a hard timebox can ensure you address every task in your backlog—similarly, during a meeting, using hard timeboxes can help you hit every item on your agenda.

- A soft timebox, on the other hand, is more flexible. In a soft timebox, the end of the timebox is a suggestion that you should wrap up what you’re doing and move on to the next task. You can use soft timeboxes for complex work, especially if you aren’t sure exactly how long the task will take when you get started. As a team, creating soft timeboxes gives your collaborators more flexibility while still helping everyone align on when work should be completed. During a meeting, using soft timeboxes can help you stay on track without interrupting the conversation, the way a hard timebox might.

- Deciding whether to set a hard or soft timebox depends on what your work goals are—and you don’t just have to use one or another. At the beginning of each timebox you set, decide if it’s a hard or soft timebox, and hold yourself to that expectation accordingly.

- **Increase motivation with goal-oriented time management.** When you create a timebox, you’re setting a goal for yourself: to complete a particular task within these pre-set time constraints. Even if you don’t always succeed, giving yourself something to work towards can be motivating—especially if you aren’t excited about the work.

- **Reduce perfectionism.** If you frequently agonize over already-finished tasks, timeboxing can unblock you and help you increase productivity. Timeboxing operates off of the principle of progress over perfection. Once your timebox is up, you need to move on—even if the task you’re working on isn’t perfect.

- Problem: I’m struggling to finish my task before the timebox is up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwcc8e2hcv09q7defh22w9ht))
- **Solution:** You may run into issues early on where you simply didn’t set aside enough time to finish the task. That’s ok—it’s part of the learning process. At first, try soft timeboxes, so you can still finish tasks if you underestimate how long they should take. The more timeboxes you set, the better you’ll get at estimating how long a task takes.

- Problem: Timeboxes are too short ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwcc8hedcxk6c3a67bfvxb5t))
- **Solution:** In our opinion, this is actually a plus. Breaking work down into smaller chunks can help you better understand where your time is actually going. If your team is timeboxing together, breaking large tasks into smaller components also gives your team a better sense of what you’re doing and by when. Make sure to track work in a [work management system](https://asana.com/uses/work-management), like Asana, so you can easily view not only the full body of work but its smaller components.

- Problem: When the timer goes off, it interrupts my flow ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwcc8nk1d2y943bj14z57xpt))
- **Solution:** The best part of timeboxing is when you get into flow—and it can be frustrating when the timer rings and you have to switch tasks. That’s why we recommend grouping like tasks in back-to-back timeboxes. Say you have to create a sales pitch and prepare an email for the same client. Putting those timeboxes side by side—with an optional five minute break in the middle—can help you roll from one task to another.

- Remember, timeboxing is a tool for you to use. If you’re totally in the groove and want to break the rules a little—go for it. Use the timebox framework as a launching pad for effective work, no matter what that looks like for you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwcc8r20yjczf151n5c7dek6))

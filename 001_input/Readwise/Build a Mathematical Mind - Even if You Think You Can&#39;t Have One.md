### Highlights

- We envision a curriculum that elevates the methods by which mathematics is created and the techniques used by researchers to a status equal to that enjoyed by the results of that research. The goal is not to train large numbers of high school students to be university mathematicians. Rather, it is to help high school students learn and adopt some of the ways that mathematicians think about problems.[ix] ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTB8H4Z8&location=161))
  - Note: Very important but not achievable in our system. the kids aren't ready the teachers aren't ready the least up and culture is all wrong
- The eight practices are:   Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. Reason abstractly and quantitatively. Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. Model with mathematics. Use appropriate tools strategically. Attend to precision. Look for and make use of structure. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.[x] ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BTB8H4Z8&location=172))

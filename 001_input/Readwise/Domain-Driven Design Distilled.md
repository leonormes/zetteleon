### Highlights

- Strategic Design We begin with the all-important strategic design. You really cannot apply tactical design in an effective way unless you begin with strategic design. Strategic design is used like broad brushstrokes prior to getting into the details of implementation. It highlights what is strategically important to your business, how to divide up the work by importance, and how to best integrate as needed.

- Technology-Free Domain Model Although there will be technology scattered throughout your architecture, the domain model should be free of technology.

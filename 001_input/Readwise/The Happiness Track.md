### Highlights

- Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it. —Maya Angelou ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OKJWYB0&location=76))
- I believe most of us want to be like the French press workers: we want to do a good job—and we want to enjoy doing it. Everyone wants to be successful and happy. And yet achieving these two goals has never been more elusive. ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OKJWYB0&location=93))
- Happiness—defined as a state of heightened positive emotion—has a profound positive effect on our professional and personal lives. It increases our emotional and social intelligence, boosts our productivity, and heightens our influence over peers and colleagues. These are the very ingredients that allow us to be successful without having to sacrifice our health and psychological well-being.

- Intellectually. Positive emotions help you learn faster, think more creatively, and resolve challenging situations. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OKJWYB0&location=190))

- Additionally, positive emotions are associated with reduced inflammation.20 In other words, being happier helps to keep you healthier, even if you work in a high-intensity or stress-inducing environment. In fact, positive emotions speed up recovery from the cardiovascular impact of stress.21 Preliminary studies have also shown that lightening up with laughter normalizes levels of the stress hormone cortisol, boosts immune function, and reduces inflammation.22 ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OKJWYB0&location=226))
- In the following chapters, I will share empirically validated data demonstrating that the path to long-term success and well-being is often the opposite of what we’ve been taught. We will examine how the counterproductive theories of success that dominate our culture backfire and undermine our best efforts.

  - Note: Why is everything we've ever been taught always wrong in these books?

- It required what a friend calls “putting every word on trial for its life”: changing an adjective, cutting a phrase, removing a comma, and putting the comma back in. ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0081GDOCQ&location=60))
  - Note: Every line of code needs to justify itself. I needs to fight for it's life
- I remember how she made Shelley come alive for me—this was, as it were, her first experiment of this kind. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0081GDOCQ&location=212))

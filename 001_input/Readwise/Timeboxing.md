### Highlights

- Review your to-do list. If you don’t keep one, start! To-do lists feed timeboxing; the better your to-do list, the better your timeboxing. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CGZJ3XDN&location=493))
- Start, make mistakes and learn quickly. To begin with, you will frequently underor overestimate how long tasks take — this is normal. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CGZJ3XDN&location=496))
- Stick to the plan. Don’t second-guess yourself and undermine your earlier decision. Barring an emergency, what you thought earlier in the planning process, when you were calm and clear, is better than what you think to do reactively in the maelstrom of the day.

- You’ll get distracted and derailed. Expect this. When it happens, practise coming back to the timebox (return to the calendar), to your original task. With experience, your distractions will become fewer and shorter-lived. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CGZJ3XDN&location=503))
- Several scientific papers (largely led by Peter Gollwitzer10 in the 1990s) indicate that setting out intentions formally ahead of time significantly increases the likelihood of attaining a goal. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CGZJ3XDN&location=540))
- Timeboxing is a form of implementation intention (when situation X arises, I will perform response Y), a method for which there is plenty of scientific evidence. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CGZJ3XDN&location=685))

- A mantra of some hard-line timeboxers is, ‘If it’s not in the calendar, it doesn’t exist’, i.e., that unless it’s timeboxed, a given activity is very unlikely to be made to happen in the future. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CGZJ3XDN&location=734))
- Agency is the feeling of control over your actions and their consequences. Plenty of ancient and modern wisdom centres around focusing on the things we can control, rather than trying to exert a wider influence and feeling disappointed when we fail. Timeboxing is a pragmatic means of applying this guidance. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CGZJ3XDN&location=816))
- I never sit down to write cold; I simply don’t trust that I will be able to muster the right ideas and words. Instead, I timebox multiple short sessions well in advance, in which I gather my thoughts and research, take a look at it all together without any particular exertion or pressure, give my subconscious a day and a night to process, and only after that set out to write. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CGZJ3XDN&location=887))
- The 15 minutes we might spend setting up our timeboxes each morning substantially affect the following 15 hours we spend in execution. That’s 15 minutes of planning time to ensure that 15 hours of life is lived productively — a factoring of 60x. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CGZJ3XDN&location=895))
- Make it appealing, especially at the start; for example, you might like to coincide your daily planning timebox with the sipping of your preferred morning drink. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CGZJ3XDN&location=1229))

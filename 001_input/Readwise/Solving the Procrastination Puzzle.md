### Highlights

- discount future rewards in relation to short-term rewards, underestimate the time things will take and overestimate how much we can do, prefer tomorrow over today, self-handicap to protect self-esteem, think irrationally about the task at hand and our ability to accomplish the task, and manufacture our own happiness by changing our thinking to be consistent with our behavior.

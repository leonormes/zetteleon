## Did Adam Have a Previous Wife Called Lilith

Lilith appears in some strands of Jewish folklore and mythology as Adam's first wife, but this idea is not present in the canonical Biblical texts and only arose in later sources[^1_2][^1_6]. The most influential origin of the Lilith story as Adam's first wife is found in the medieval Jewish text called "The Alphabet of Ben Sira" (written between 700-1000 AD)[^1_2][^1_1][^1_6]. In this version, Lilith was created at the same time and from the same substance as Adam, insisting on equality and eventually leaving him due to their disagreements, after which Eve was created from Adam's rib[^1_6][^1_2].

### Key Points

- In mainstream Judaism and Christianity, Lilith does not feature as Adam's wife—Eve is exclusively recognized in canonical scripture[^1_1][^1_7].
- The Lilith legend is rooted in non-biblical, post-biblical rabbinic literature and only gained more widespread recognition in the Middle Ages[^1_2][^1_6].
- The story is used to address or reconcile the two different creation accounts in Genesis, where Genesis 1:27 refers to man and woman being created simultaneously, and Genesis 2 describes Eve being created from Adam's rib[^1_6][^1_2].
- Lilith is more commonly associated in Jewish legend as a demon or a night spirit, not as Adam's wife in most sources[^1_2].
- Modern interest in the Lilith myth rose significantly only in the 20th century, often linked to feminist re-interpretations and interest in alternative creation stories[^1_7].

### Conclusion

The story that Adam had a previous wife called Lilith is a well-known myth that arose from medieval Jewish texts, not from the Bible or early religious doctrine. In canonical Abrahamic scripture, Eve is Adam's only recognized wife, and Lilith's association as his first wife is a legendary development from much later sources[^1_2][^1_6][^1_1].

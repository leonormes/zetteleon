title: Making a behavior easy increases the likelihood it will become a habit

A fundamental principle of habit formation, especially relevant for ADHD, is that the easier a behavior is to perform, the more likely it is to stick. Once a simple habit feels automatic, new habits can be layered on top, one at a time, to gradually build a more complex routine.

The key is to only increase challenge once the current step feels easy and automatic. For example, rather than committing to exercise five times per week immediately, start with two sessions. Only after those two sessions feel sustainable and comfortable should you consider adding a third. This prevents the snap-back effect that comes from overextension.

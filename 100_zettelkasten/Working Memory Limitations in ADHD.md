People with ADHD often experience limitations in their working memory, which directly impacts their ability to manage complex tasks and maintain focus.

Working memory is the cognitive system responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information needed for complex tasks. When working memory is overloaded, it can lead to distractibility, forgetfulness, and difficulty completing tasks. The brain struggles to maintain focus on the task at hand when it is also burdened with keeping track of other tasks and commitments.

## The ADHD Connection

Working memory limitations in ADHD are part of broader [[Executive Function Challenges are Central to ADHD]]. These deficits particularly affect:

- Task initiation and completion
- Following multi-step instructions
- Mental math and complex reasoning
- Managing competing priorities

## Cognitive Load Implications

- Lower threshold for intrinsic cognitive load
- Greater impact from extraneous cognitive load
- Need for more deliberate germane load management

## Compensatory Strategies

The solution involves external cognitive support systems:

[[Zettelkasten the Extended Mind]] - Offloading memory to external systems

[[A Digital System Can Externalise and Organise Thoughts]] - Practical implementation

[[External Structure and ADHD]] - Why external structure is crucial for ADHD

[[Limited Capacity Brain]] - Understanding the fundamental constraint

[[Purpose of my PKM system]] - Personal knowledge management as cognitive prosthetic

**Compensation Strategy:**
Leverage [[Diffuse vs Focused Thinking Modes]] with:
- Shorter focused intervals
- More frequent movement breaks

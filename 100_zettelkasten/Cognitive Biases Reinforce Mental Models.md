Even when faced with contradictory evidence, we have a strong tendency to believe our existing mental models are correct. This is not just stubbornness, but the result of powerful cognitive biases that create a strong reinforcement loop.

1. **Confirmation Bias:** This is our tendency to actively seek out, interpret, and recall information that confirms our pre-existing beliefs, while simultaneously ignoring or dismissing challenging information. It creates a feedback loop that continually strengthens our conviction.
2. **Cognitive Dissonance:** When a stark conflict arises between our models and reality, it creates a state of mental discomfort. To alleviate this, we are motivated to resolve the conflict. Often, the easiest path is to reject the new information (e.g., by dismissing the source) rather than rebuilding a complex and deeply ingrained mental model.
3. **The Dunning-Kruger Effect:** This bias leads individuals with limited competence in a domain to significantly overestimate their ability. This can result in an unshakeable faith in a flawed or simplistic model, as the individual lacks the expertise to even recognize its shortcomings.

These biases explain why our models feel infallible and why changing our minds is such a difficult cognitive task. It also highlights the importance of remembering that [[All Models Are Wrong But Some Are Useful]].

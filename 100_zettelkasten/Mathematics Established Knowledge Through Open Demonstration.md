In direct opposition to the alchemical method, mathematics founded its claim to knowledge on radical openness. Its credibility rested on demonstrations that were, by their nature, accessible to all for scrutiny.

The method of mathematics is the "cold light of rigorous logic". It proceeds not by allusion or hidden symbolism, but by clear, demonstrable, and refutable steps. This transparency is fundamental to its integrity and power, inviting peer examination rather than concealing knowledge for a select few.

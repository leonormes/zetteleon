## Strong Habits Override Weak Intentions

**Summary:** Systems are effective because they build strong, automatic habits that reliably override conscious intentions, which are often weak and inconsistent.

**Details:** Psychological studies show that intentions (goals) are poor predictors of behavior, especially for frequently repeated actions. When motivation is low, a person will default to their established habits, not their stated goals. A system ensures progress by making desired actions automatic, removing the need to rely on willpower or fluctuating motivation. This is the difference between temporarily achieving a goal (like cleaning a room) and maintaining the outcome by changing the underlying habits.

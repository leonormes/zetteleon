title: Designed Task Switching Leverages Dopamine Boosts for ADHD Motivation

Designed task switching is an ADHD management strategy where less-preferred tasks are intentionally alternated with enjoyable or desired tasks on a to-do list. This method leverages the dopamine boost from the enjoyable activities to create momentum and provide the motivation needed to return to more difficult tasks.

To be effective, this strategy requires structure, such as using time blocks or defining micro-steps, to prevent getting stuck in the more enjoyable task and derailing the overall workflow.

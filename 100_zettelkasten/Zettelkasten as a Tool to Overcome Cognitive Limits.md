title: Zettelkasten as a Tool to Overcome Cognitive Limits

The Zettelkasten is a tool to overcome our innate cognitive limits. It is a practical application of [[The Extended Mind Thesis]], helping us manage the problem of our [[Limited Capacity Brain]].

We offload our thoughts into the system, and as [[Writing puts us in the powerful position of being able to observe our thinking]], we can then interact with those thoughts more objectively.

This is a core reason why [[Cognitive Engagement Activates Zettelkasten]].

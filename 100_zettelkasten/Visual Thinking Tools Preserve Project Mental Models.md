## Visual Thinking Tools Preserve Project Mental Models

**Summary:** Visual tools like mind maps, sketches, and color-coded diagrams can effectively preserve the complex, often non-linear mental model one has during a creative work session.

**Details:** When deep in a project, the understanding of how components interact is clear. This understanding is often lost upon returning. Creating a quick visual representation of this model—or even taking photos of physical notes—acts as a powerful anchor to the previous thought process. A brief voice memo can also be recorded to explain the visualization.

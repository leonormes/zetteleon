**Summary:** Intuitionism rejects the classical law of excluded middle—the principle that for any proposition P, either P or ¬P must be true—arguing that a statement can be neither provably true nor provably false.

**The Rejection:**

Classical logic assumes that for any mathematical proposition P, either P is true or its negation ¬P is true. Intuitionists argue this is valid only when we have a method to decide which holds. For some statements, we might have neither a proof of P nor a proof of ¬P, making the law inapplicable.

**Effect on Proofs:**

This rejection invalidates proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum) when used non-constructively. In classical mathematics, proving ¬¬P is equivalent to proving P. Intuitionists demand an explicit construction, not merely the refutation of a refutation.

**Example:** The statement "There exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational" can be proven non-constructively in classical mathematics but requires constructive proof in intuitionist mathematics.

**Consequence:** This stance requires rejecting or reformulating large portions of classical mathematics, which many mathematicians find too restrictive.

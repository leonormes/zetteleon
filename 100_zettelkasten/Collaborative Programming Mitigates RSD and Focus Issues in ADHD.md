## Collaborative Programming Mitigates RSD and Focus Issues in ADHD

**Summary:** Collaborative programming methods, such as pair or mob programming, can be a powerful accommodation for developers with ADHD by mitigating Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD) and focus-related challenges.

**Details:** These practices provide a psychologically safe environment where feedback is delivered in real-time, gently, and in a normalized context, preventing the emotional overwhelm that can come from batched critiques in pull requests. It also helps maintain focus, prevents developers from getting lost in "coding rabbit holes" during hyperfocus, and provides an external structure to the workflow.

The Labyrinth of Versailles, a garden maze built for King Louis XIV, represented a shift in fable storytelling towards a visual and interactive medium.

The labyrinth featured 39 fountains, each depicting a different fable, primarily from Aesop and La Fontaine. Visitors would wander through the maze and encounter these sculptural installations, each telling a moral story through its design and an accompanying plaque.

This transformed the fable from a purely literary experience into a physical and immersive one, using art and landscape architecture to convey its allegorical lessons.

title: ADHD Causes Task Initiation Deficits Due to Dopamine Hyposensitivity
type: concept

Individuals with ADHD often struggle with task initiation because their brains require significantly more energy to begin a task. This difficulty is linked to a hyposensitivity of dopamine neurons in the striatum, meaning that the perceived importance of a task does not trigger sufficient neurotransmitter activity to generate internal motivation, especially for tasks that are boring or repetitive.

**Behavioral Manifestations:**
- Reliance on interest/novelty triggers (see [[The ADHD Brain Operates as an Interest-Based Nervous System]])
- Difficulty with "important but boring" tasks
- Improved initiation with immediate rewards

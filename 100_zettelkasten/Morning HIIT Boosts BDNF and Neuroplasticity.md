A short, 4-minute session of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) in the morning can significantly boost cognitive function. This type of exercise increases VO2 max (cardiorespiratory fitness), boosts Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) by 4-5x, and enhances neuroplasticity, which is critical for learning and memory.

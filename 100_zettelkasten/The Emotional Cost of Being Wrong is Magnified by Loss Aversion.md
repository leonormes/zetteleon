title: The Emotional Cost of Being Wrong is Magnified by Loss Aversion

Body:

Being proven wrong can be framed as an emotional or intellectual "loss," while being right is a "gain." Applying the principle of Loss Aversion to this domain, the pain of being wrong is approximately twice as potent as the pleasure of being right.

This emotional imbalance creates a strong disincentive to challenge our own beliefs or admit error. It helps explain why people engage in [[Confirmation bias amplifies LLM validation|confirmation bias]] and defend their positions fiercely, as the psychological cost of "losing" the argument feels disproportionately high. This is a significant barrier to objective truth-seeking and learning.

## Diffuse Vs Focused Thinking Modes

**Summary:** The brain alternates between two complementary processing states:

- **Focused Mode:**
  - Conscious, directed attention
  - Left hemisphere dominant
  - For analytical problem-solving
- **Diffuse Mode:**
  - Subconscious, broad connections
  - Right hemisphere dominant
  - For creative insight and consolidation

**Optimization:**
- Alternate 25min focused / 5min diffuse breaks
- Physical movement enhances diffuse thinking

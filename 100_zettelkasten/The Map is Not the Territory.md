## The Map is Not the Territory

**Summary:** The mental model "The Map is Not the Territory" states that our mental models, beliefs, and perceptions are simplified maps of reality, not reality itself.

**Details:** This concept, coined by Alfred Korzybski, is a fundamental principle of intellectual humility. It acknowledges that our understanding of the world is always an abstraction and is therefore inherently incomplete and potentially flawed. The goal is not to create a perfect map, but to create a useful one and, crucially, to remember to update the map whenever we encounter new terrain (evidence) that contradicts it. This reduces the pressure to be "right" and increases adaptability.

## The Ladder of Abstraction Models Conceptual Granularity

**Summary:** S.I. Hayakawa's ladder of abstraction describes a continuum from concrete specifics to abstract generalizations, with each rung representing a different level of conceptual granularity. This model is fundamental to understanding [[The Science of Modelling and Abstraction]] and how we construct [[Mental Models MOC|mental models]] of reality.

**Structure:**
- **Top:** Broad abstractions (e.g., "wealth", "justice"). At these higher levels, [[Higher Abstraction Levels Increase Breadth But Reduce Depth|breadth of understanding increases but depth decreases]]. This is akin to [[Abstraction as Climbing a Hill|climbing a hill]] to see a wider landscape.
- **Middle:** Intermediate concepts.
- **Bottom:** Concrete instances (e.g., "my 2018 Ford Fiesta"). Moving down the ladder is often part of [[The Drill Down Phase of Thinking Follows Brainstorming|drilling down]] from a broad idea to specifics.

**Usage:**
- Experts move fluidly between levels, understanding when to generalize and when to focus on specifics. This flexibility is crucial for effective problem-solving and communication.
- Communication requires matching the audience's level of abstraction. Failing to do so can lead to misunderstanding or [[Leaky Abstractions|leaky abstractions]] where underlying details unexpectedly become relevant.
- The concept of different levels of abstraction also applies to how we define and process information, as explored in [[Three Perspectives on Information (Map of Content)]], where information can be viewed with varying degrees of granularity.

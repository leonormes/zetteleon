# Disrespectful Spending Violates Shared Agreements and Erodes Trust

**Summary:** Spending becomes disrespectful when one person's actions violate shared agreements and trust, such as by breaking spending rules, hiding purchases, or jeopardizing mutual goals.

**Details:** Key examples of disrespectful spending include violating agreed-upon spending limits, hiding purchases or lying about their cost (financial infidelity), and making unilateral large purchases. These actions show contempt for the partnership and breach fundamental trust.

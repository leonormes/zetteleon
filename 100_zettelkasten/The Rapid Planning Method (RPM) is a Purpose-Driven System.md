# The Rapid Planning Method (RPM) is a Purpose-Driven System

**Summary:** The Rapid Planning Method (RPM), developed by Tony Robbins, is a purpose-driven productivity system centered on defining the specific Results desired, understanding the Purpose ("why") behind them, and creating a Massive Action Plan (MAP).

**Details:** RPM's strength lies in its motivational power, derived from a clear focus on purpose. The MAP phase incorporates time blocking by organizing tasks into "RPM blocks" and can use time boxing for specific actions. This system is designed to align daily actions with a long-term vision.

## In Music as Expression the Artist Controls the Creative Vision

**Summary:** In music that is primarily a form of expression, the artist or creating group maintains control over the final output.

**Details:** The creators are driven to get a specific feeling or idea out into the world, rather than trying to fit their work into a pre-existing commercial formula or box. Their vision guides the work, preserving its authentic intent.

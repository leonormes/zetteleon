The traditional practice of [[Morita Therapy]] involves a structured, four-stage process designed to guide an individual from a state of emotional preoccupation to one of purposeful action.

1. **Rest Period:** The initial stage involves isolated rest, where the goal is to accept the current emotional state without trying to change it. This allows the natural fluctuation of feelings to occur without interference.
2. **Light Work:** The individual begins to engage in simple, repetitive tasks. The focus is on gentle, mindful engagement with the present moment, not on the quality of the work.
3. **Heavy Work:** The work becomes more physically demanding and requires more focus. This stage helps build confidence and shifts attention from internal states to external, purposeful activities.
4. **Real Life Integration:** The individual prepares to return to their daily life, integrating the principles of acceptance and action. The goal is to live a full life, co-existing with emotions rather than being controlled by them.

The emphasis throughout is on [[The Action-Reaction-Ping-Adjust Cycle Drives Real Progress]] rather than on intellectual insight or emotional processing alone.

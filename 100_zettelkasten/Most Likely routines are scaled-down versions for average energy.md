title: Most Likely routines are scaled-down versions for average energy

Most Likely routines are scaled-down versions designed for average-energy days—the realistic middle ground that represents typical daily capacity. This tier shortens, simplifies, or makes optional the activities from the ideal routine to create a sustainable version that can be maintained consistently.

For example, if the ideal morning includes an hour walk, the Most Likely version might reduce this to 20 minutes. A cooked breakfast becomes toast or cereal. Full grooming becomes basic essentials. Optional activities like journaling might be skipped entirely or reduced to a single sentence.

This tier should represent what you can genuinely accomplish on a regular, unremarkable day—not your best day, not your worst day, but the typical baseline. Getting this tier right is crucial because it will be the version you use most frequently, forming the foundation of actual habit consistency.

title: Setting reminders and scheduling time can help structure social reciprocity practices
type: concept

For individuals who want to increase their attention to others' needs or balance their social focus, simple structured practices can help create consistency around social reciprocity:

1. **Setting reminders** - Using phone or calendar reminders to check in with loved ones regularly
2. **Scheduling dedicated time** - Blocking out specific time periods focused exclusively on others' needs
3. **Creating systems** - Developing routines or structures that prompt other-focused behaviors

These external scaffolds can compensate for difficulties with spontaneous social awareness or when cognitive resources are limited, helping maintain relationships without requiring constant conscious effort.

This note has been broken down into atomic concepts. The core ideas are now captured in separate, focused notes that can be linked and developed independently:

## Core Concepts

- [[Success is Connection Not Mastery]] - Measuring success by cross-domain synthesis rather than deep specialization
- [[Hunter vs Farmer Brain Metaphor]] - Understanding different cognitive operating systems and their strengths
- [[Process Over Outcome Mindset]] - Focusing on the intrinsic value of learning rather than external credentials
- [[Intellectual Explorer vs Academic Specialist]] - Recognizing exploration as a legitimate intellectual identity

## Context

What you're feeling is a potent form of Imposter Syndrome, amplified by the perceived gap between your ambition and your execution. The first step is to change the metric of success by embracing these reframed perspectives.

## Related Concepts

- [[Novelty Seeking]]
- [[Hyperfocus is a State of Intense Interest-Driven Focus in ADHD]]
- [[The ADHD nervous system is primarily interest-driven]]
- [[Shame]]
- [[Generative Intelligence]]

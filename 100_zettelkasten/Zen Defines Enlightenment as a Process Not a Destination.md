## Zen Defines Enlightenment as a Process Not a Destination

**Summary:** In Zen, enlightenment is not a permanent, mystical state to be achieved, but an ongoing process of "waking up" to the true nature of reality.

**Details:** This waking up involves the direct recognition of interconnectedness, impermanence, and the absence of a permanent, separate self (anatta). It is not a final destination but a series of moments of clarity. According to this view, no one is *always* enlightened; there are only enlightened actions or moments that come and go like everything else.

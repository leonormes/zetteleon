Folgezettel (the alphanumeric ID system) is often misinterpreted as creating a hierarchical tree structure. This is incorrect. While IDs like 1.1a1 appear to suggest that the note is a "child" of 1.1a, this is merely an addressing convention, not a parent-child relationship.

Example: Note 1.1a about "apples are healthy" and 1.1a1 about "the history of apple cultivation" are not in a hierarchical relationship - they simply share an address space that indicates they were created in sequence and are related.

## Unilateral Spending on Major Purchases is a Sign of an Unhealthy Financial Dynamic

**Summary:** When one partner makes a significant financial decision without discussion or mutual agreement, it is an indicator of an unhealthy and uncooperative financial relationship.

**Details:** This holds true even when the spending is for the children. A healthy partnership requires budgeting discussions, transparency, and mutual agreement for large expenses. Acting unilaterally, especially when resorting to debt without consultation, dismisses the other partner's role and undermines the financial security of the family unit.

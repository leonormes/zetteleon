**Summary:** Formalism holds that mathematics is not about anything "real" but is the manipulation of meaningless symbols according to pre-defined, formal rules. The focus is on internal consistency rather than meaning or connection to reality.

**Core Thesis:** Mathematical statements are not "true" or "false" in any absolute sense, only "provable" or "not provable" within a given axiomatic system. The first principle is consistency within a formal system.

**Analogy:** Mathematics is like chess. The pieces (symbols) have no inherent meaning, but their power is defined by the rules of movement (axioms). A "proof" is just a valid sequence of moves.

**Key Proponent:** David Hilbert championed this view in the early 20th century.

**Challenge:** Like Logicism, Formalism was shaken by Gödel's work, which proved that the consistency of a formal system like arithmetic cannot be proven within that system. It also struggles to explain why mathematics is so unreasonably effective in describing the physical world.

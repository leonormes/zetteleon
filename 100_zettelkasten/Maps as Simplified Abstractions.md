Maps are simplified abstractions that omit details to serve specific purposes. A road map excludes geological features, topography, and off-road paths because these details would clutter the primary function of navigation between major routes.

This selective omission is not a flaw but a feature—the utility of any abstraction comes from what it chooses to ignore. [[Leaky Abstractions]] occur when the omitted details become relevant to the task at hand.

## The Trade-off of Simplification

Every abstraction involves a trade-off between completeness and usability. The more details included, the more accurate but less manageable the model becomes. The fewer details, the more useful but potentially misleading.

This principle applies beyond physical maps to:

- [[Mental Models as Evolutionary Filters|Mental models]] that filter complex reality
- Scientific theories that focus on measurable phenomena
- Programming abstractions that hide implementation complexity

## When Simplification Fails

Problems arise when we encounter situations where the omitted details matter. A road map fails when you need to traverse terrain it doesn't represent. Similarly, [[Flawed Mental Models Limit Mastery]] when they exclude crucial aspects of reality.

The key is recognizing the boundaries of any abstraction and knowing when to seek more detailed or different models.

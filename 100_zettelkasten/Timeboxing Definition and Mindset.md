Timeboxing is both a method and a mindset focused on selecting what to do before distractions, specifying tasks in a calendar with start/end times, focusing on one thing at a time, and doing tasks to an acceptable standard.

## Why It Works for ADHD

- Externalizes executive functions (planning, prioritization, initiation) by committing tasks to time blocks.
- Reduces time blindness using visual timers and explicit start/stop boundaries.
- Creates mild, constructive urgency (the ticking timer) that aids task initiation.
- Improves internal time perception through repeated practice with bounded sessions.

**Information** is a perceivable **pattern** or structure that is distinguishable from random noise. For data to be considered informative in a practical or semantic sense, it must contain a degree of predictability, rules, or repetition.

For example, the English language is informative because it has structure:

- The letter 'E' is more frequent than 'Z'.
- The letter 'Q' is almost always followed by 'U'.
- Words follow grammatical rules.

A stream of random, jumbled letters lacks these patterns and thus conveys no interpretable information. This intuitive definition views information as the opposite of chaos.

## Elaboration Through Own Words Deepens Understanding

**Summary:** Main notes must be written in your own words, not copied from sources. This process of translating ideas into personal language constitutes elaboration, facilitating deeper understanding and long-term learning.

**Details:** The requirement to write notes in your own words is not arbitrary—it's where genuine learning happens. When you translate someone else's idea into your own language, you must first understand it well enough to explain it independently. This is elaborative encoding: connecting new information to existing knowledge through active processing. Simply copying quotes or summaries bypasses this crucial cognitive work. Writing in your own words forces you to: (1) identify what you actually understand vs. what you merely recognized, (2) connect the idea to your existing conceptual framework, (3) clarify vague understanding through the demand for coherent expression, and (4) create a note that authentically reflects your interpretation rather than the source's framing. This isn't just paraphrasing—it's thinking. The difficulty of finding your own words is diagnostic: if you can't rephrase an idea, you haven't understood it yet. This principle aligns with the broader insight that writing is thinking, not just communicating. The Zettelkasten becomes genuinely yours through this practice.

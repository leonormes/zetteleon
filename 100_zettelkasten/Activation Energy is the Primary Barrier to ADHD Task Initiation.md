For individuals with ADHD, the greatest point of friction in productivity is often **task initiation**. This difficulty is not a matter of laziness or lack of desire, but a neurological challenge related to executive function.

The concept of **activation energy** from chemistry provides a powerful metaphor: it is the minimum amount of energy required to start a reaction. For an ADHD brain, the perceived activation energy to begin a task—especially one that is not novel, urgent, or intrinsically interesting—can exceed the available mental and emotional resources.

This creates a seemingly insurmountable barrier, leading to procrastination and a state of paralysis, even when the task is important and well-understood. The core problem is not the task itself, but the immense effort required to cross the threshold from "not doing" to "doing".

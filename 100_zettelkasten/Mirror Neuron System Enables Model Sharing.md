The mirror neuron system is a crucial biological mechanism that allows humans to share models of action and intention despite the private nature of mental models. These remarkable brain cells fire both when you perform an action and when you observe someone else performing that same action.

## How Mirror Neurons Work

When you see someone smile, your mirror neurons associated with smiling fire. This creates a low-level, internal simulation of the other person's action and its associated feeling in your own brain. It's a form of direct, non-verbal empathy that helps you understand the intentions and emotional states of others.

This system bridges the gap between seeing an action and "feeling" its meaning, allowing our models of other people's internal states to be surprisingly accurate without direct access to their private experiences.

## Enabling Model Transmission

Mirror neurons work in concert with other mechanisms to enable model sharing:

- **Shared Biological Foundation**: We can understand each other because we run on remarkably similar biological hardware with consistent sensory systems
- **Symbolic Language**: Language packages complex, private experiences into shared, abstract symbols (words), creating public pointers to private experiences
- **Metaphorical Communication**: We use metaphors to describe qualities of internal states—saying you feel "down" or have a "heavy heart" uses shared physical concepts to communicate private emotional experiences

These mechanisms work together: shared biology provides the common canvas, mirror neurons let us simulate each other's intentions, and language provides the symbolic toolkit to package and exchange emotionally-driven models.

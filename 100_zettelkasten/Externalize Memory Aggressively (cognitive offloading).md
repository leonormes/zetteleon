Your mind generates; your system stores.

- Use a single second brain: Obsidian or Logseq for graph-linked notes. Create a “Daily Scratchpad” for raw thoughts and a “Permanent Notes” area for distilled concepts with links. Use templates like “Definition / Example / Why it matters / Connections.”
- For code and research, keep “README-trails” in each repo/folder explaining decisions, open questions, and next steps. Treat every idea as a ticket you can pick up later.

## Praxis is the Cyclical Process of Action and Reflection to Transform the World

**Summary:** In modern philosophy, particularly in the work of thinkers like Paulo Freire and Hannah Arendt, praxis refers to the cyclical, intertwined process of "reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it."

**Details:** The philosophy of praxis rejects the separation of theory and practice. Instead, it views them as a continuous loop where action informs reflection, which in turn builds theory that guides further, more informed action. This framework emphasizes that studying the world is insufficient; there is a responsibility to act in order to create change.

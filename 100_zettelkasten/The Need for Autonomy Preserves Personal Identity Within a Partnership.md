## The Need for Autonomy Preserves Personal Identity Within a Partnership

**Summary:** A core need within a partnership is for autonomy, which allows an individual to maintain their own identity outside of their roles as a spouse or parent.

**Details:** This need is met through having personal space and time to decompress alone, as well as receiving support from one's partner to have individual hobbies, interests, and friendships.

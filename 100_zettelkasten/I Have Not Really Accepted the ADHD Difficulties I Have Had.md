title: I Have Not Really Accepted the ADHD Difficulties I Have Had

I realised recently that although I have had the diagnosis for a few years, I have not really accepted the difficulties it has given me. I still see it as me being lazy, or incompetent. I have ignored the fact that having ADHD means I have executive function differences. I am not giving myself the compassion I deserve. I am still blaming myself. I think I am refusing to allow these things to be an excuse for poor performance.

Lifelong observations with no guidebook have put me in a misconfigured state. Those ADHD traits we band around with little real understanding have had a lasting and irreparable effect on who I am.

Unbeknownst to me, my brain tricked me.

Hoodwinked by my own brain! Motherfucker.

Years spent searching for something only to realise I was searching inside the thing I was looking for.

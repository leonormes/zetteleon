## Novelty Seeking in ADHD Provides Dopamine Regulation

**Summary:** ADHD novelty-seeking behaviors act as self-regulation mechanisms for dopamine-deficient brains.

**Mechanism:**
- Novel stimuli trigger dopamine release
- Compensates for baseline hyposensitivity
- Creates reinforcement loop

**Manifestations:**
- System switching ("Shiny Object Syndrome")
- Hyperfocus on new projects
- Constant optimization of tools

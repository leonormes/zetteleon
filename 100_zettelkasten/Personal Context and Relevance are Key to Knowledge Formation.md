## Personal Context and Relevance Are Key to Knowledge Formation

**Summary:** Information is more likely to become knowledge when it is relevant to an individual's personal needs, goals, and existing experiences.

**Details:** When information is connected to an individual's specific context or field of expertise, it becomes more meaningful. This personal relevance increases the likelihood that the information will be retained, integrated, and utilized as actionable knowledge.

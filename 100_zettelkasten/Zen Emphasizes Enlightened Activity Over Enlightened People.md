## Zen Emphasizes Enlightened Activity Over Enlightened People

**Summary:** Zen practice emphasizes compassionate, mindful action in each moment rather than the pursuit of a permanent personal status of being "enlightened."

**Details:** This principle, articulated by teachers like Suzuki Roshi, shifts the focus from an ego-centric goal of self-improvement to the practical application of wisdom and compassion in daily life. The goal is not to become an enlightened person, but to engage in enlightened activity. This makes the practice accessible and immediate, grounding it in present-moment action rather than an abstract future achievement.

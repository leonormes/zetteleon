Excalidraw can be used to create an interactive visual map of David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology.

1. **Create Nodes for Categories**: Draw shapes (circles, rectangles) for the main GTD stages:
    - Capture
    - Clarify
    - Organize
    - Reflect
    - Engage
2. **Use Visual Cues**: Use color or icons (e.g., an inbox for Capture) to differentiate the nodes.
3. **Represent Flow with Arrows**: Use the Connector/Arrow tool to show the progression of tasks through the system.
4. **Link to Obsidian Notes**: Right-click on a shape and use "Insert Link" to connect the visual node to a corresponding note in your vault (e.g., `[[GTD - Capture]]`). This allows you to jump from the visual map to detailed text.
5. **Use Hierarchical Layers**: Create a main GTD overview map, and then create separate, more detailed sub-maps for concepts like "Contexts" or "Next Actions," linking them back to the main map.

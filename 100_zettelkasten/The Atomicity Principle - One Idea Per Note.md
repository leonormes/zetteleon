## The Atomicity Principle - One Idea Per Note

**Summary:** Each note in a Zettelkasten must contain one single, indivisible idea distilled to its essential point. This simplicity makes ideas context-sensitive and maximally reusable.

**Details:** The atomicity principle is fundamental to Zettelkasten methodology. Every main note (permanent/evergreen note) should embody one single concept, distilled to its crux. This laser focus on a single essential point serves multiple purposes: it makes the note easier to connect to other ideas across different contexts, enables genuine reuse and recombination, and prevents the confusion that arises from mixing multiple divergent ideas in one location. An atomic note is about one thing, making it "sensitive to context"—it can be meaningfully linked to various other concepts without dragging along irrelevant baggage. When notes contain multiple ideas, they become unwieldy and their connections become ambiguous. The principle is comparable to software engineering's separation of concerns, where modules should have a single responsibility to maximize cohesion and reusability.

## The Challenge of True Atomicity

In practice, achieving "true" atomicity is challenging because:

1. **Implicit dependencies** always exist - foundational concepts must be understood
2. **Context is unavoidable** - meaning exists within frameworks
3. **Perfect independence is a myth** - all ideas connect to others

The goal is not absolute independence but **loose coupling**: notes that can be understood on their own yet meaningfully connect to create emergent insights. See [[200_projects/ProdOS/The Problem of False Atoms]] for deep exploration of this tension.

## Practical Guidelines

- **One idea per note:** If discussing cause AND effect, create two linked notes
- **Title as complete statement:** Express the core assertion fully
- **Define terms:** Manage implicit dependencies explicitly
- **Context in links:** Explain WHY you're connecting ideas

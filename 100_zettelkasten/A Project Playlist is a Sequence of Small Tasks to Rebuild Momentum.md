## A Project Playlist is a Sequence of Small Tasks to Rebuild Momentum

**Summary:** A "project playlist" is a curated sequence of small, concrete tasks designed to be completed in order to progressively rebuild momentum and ease re-entry into a complex project.

**Details:** This list acts as a warm-up routine. The tasks at the beginning should be especially small and easy, gradually increasing in complexity. Completing the sequence helps to re-establish focus and recall the broader context of the project before tackling more demanding work.

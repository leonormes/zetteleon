## Historical Achievements Were Driven by Collective Will and Urgent Necessity

**Summary:** Major historical achievements were often driven by powerful, large-scale forces such as collective will, urgent necessity (like wars or survival), compelling missions, or strong leadership.

**Details:** These drivers operated outside the scope of modern personal productivity frameworks. Progress was frequently the result of large, collaborative efforts where specialized roles, shared knowledge, and social pressure were more critical than individual routines.

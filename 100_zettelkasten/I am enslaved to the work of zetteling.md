I want to write out what I think. But it is not working. I am not getting the remarkable deep thinking I expected to get based on what people say they get from it.

I don't spend much effort on the thinking part. I do thinking and don't capture, or I do capture but don't think. Next is combining both. Not thinking or capturing.

Although I have choice in minor details, much like choosing which way to look while on a small raft in the thrall of a raging river, my actions are possessed by the urge to link notes together.

The "meaning" derived from an interaction with an LLM does not reside in the model itself, as it has no subjective understanding. Instead, meaning is generated entirely within the user's cognitive processes.

The user creates meaning by:

- Recognising patterns of intelligent discourse in the LLM's output.
- Making connections between the AI's analysis and their own knowledge.
- Reflecting on their own thinking, which has been mirrored and restructured by the model.

Essentially, the LLM acts as a catalyst for the user's own meaning-making, rather than providing meaning itself. This makes [[LLMs as tools for thought]].

**Summary:** Outcomes are about what you get, processes are about what you do, and identity is about what you believe. Understanding this distinction is crucial for building lasting habits, as identity-based approaches are fundamentally more sustainable than outcome-based ones.

**The Three Approaches:**

**Outcome-Based Habits (What You Get):**
- Goal: "I want to read 50 books this year"
- Goal: "I want to run a marathon"
- Goal: "I want to lose 20 pounds"
- Focus: The end result or achievement

**Process-Based Habits (What You Do):**
- System: "I will read for 30 minutes every morning"
- System: "I will run three times per week"
- System: "I will track my calories and exercise daily"
- Focus: The actions and routines

**Identity-Based Habits (What You Believe):**
- Identity: "I am a reader"
- Identity: "I am a runner"
- Identity: "I am a healthy person"
- Focus: Who you are

**The Problem with Starting at Outcomes:**

When you focus on what you want to achieve rather than who you wish to become, you're building on shaky ground. The motivation is external and temporary. Once the goal is reached (or given up on), the behavior often stops because it was never tied to your sense of self.

**Why Identity Wins:**

Identity-based habits create lasting change because:

- They're intrinsically motivated (part of who you are)
- They persist beyond specific goals
- They guide decisions automatically
- They build on themselves through proof and evidence

**The Shift Required:**

Moving from "I want to achieve X" → "I do Y consistently" → "I am someone who does Y" creates sustainable transformation.

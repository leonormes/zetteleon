Excalidraw supports libraries of reusable icons to build a personal visual vocabulary.

## Using Public Libraries

1. Open the **Library** in Excalidraw (three books icon).
2. Click **Import Library** and paste a URL from [libraries.excalidraw.com](https://libraries.excalidraw.com). Popular sets include "Hand-drawn icons" and "Mind Mapping."
3. Drag icons from the library pane onto the canvas.

## Creating Your Own Library

1. Draw an icon on the canvas.
2. Select the elements of the icon.
3. Open the **Library** and click **"Save to Library"**.
4. This adds the icon to your personal library for reuse.

You can also import SVG files by dragging them onto the canvas and then saving them to your library.

For advanced users, Zsolt Viczián provides a script for the Excalidraw Script Engine that can scan your vault and automatically generate a canvas with all your icons.

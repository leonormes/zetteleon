## Emotional Labor is the Invisible Work of Managing a Household and Family

**Summary:** Emotional labor, or the mental load, is the often unseen cognitive work required to manage a family and household.

**Details:** This includes tasks like planning holidays, remembering birthdays, scheduling appointments, tracking household inventory (e.g., knowing what's in the fridge), and managing the family's social calendar. In a cooperative partnership, this burden is shared, with both partners taking initiative.

## Focus on Short-Term Learning Over Rigid Long-Term Planning

**Summary:** In a world of unpredictable change, it is more effective to focus on short-term learning and self-improvement rather than adhering to rigid long-term plans.

**Details:** Personal interests and external circumstances can change rapidly. Locking into a single, inflexible long-term path too early can limit adaptability and lead to missed opportunities. Instead, adopting an iterative mindset that prioritizes continuous learning and adjustment allows individuals to remain responsive to new information and evolving goals, fostering resilience and sustained growth.

## Action-Oriented Individuals Act Decisively Under Pressure While State-Oriented Individuals Ruminate

**Summary:** "Action versus state orientation" is a personality trait describing how individuals respond to increasing situational demands. Action-oriented individuals act decisively, while state-oriented individuals tend to get stuck in ruminative cognitions.

**Details:** When faced with adverse or demanding conditions, action-oriented individuals tend to solve problems intuitively and act rapidly without excessive rumination. In contrast, state-oriented individuals are more likely to engage in repetitive, unproductive thoughts about their situation, which can impair long-term performance. This distinction highlights a key difference in volitional processes—whether a person responds to challenges with action or gets stuck in a state of rumination.

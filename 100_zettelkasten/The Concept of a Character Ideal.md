The notion of a "character ideal" is a cornerstone of virtue ethics, a philosophical tradition dating back to ancient thinkers like Plato and Aristotle. It represents an aspirational guide for moral and ethical conduct, focusing on the cultivation of virtues.

For Aristotle, the ideal character was found in the "golden mean" – the desirable middle ground between two extremes (defects). For example, [[VIA Virtue of Courage|Courage]] is the mean between the defect of cowardice and the excess of recklessness.

In a more modern context, this concept is explored through psychological frameworks like the [[VIA Character Strengths]].

The character ideal is not a rigid standard for perfect conformity, but a guide for personal growth. The act of acknowledging a need for support is itself a sign of virtues like humility and courage.

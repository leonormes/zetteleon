title: A Digital System Can Externalise and Organise Thoughts
type: map

For a mind prone to scattered thoughts and behaviour, often associated with ADHD, a digital system can act as an external cognitive tool. It helps to capture, organise, and connect ideas that might otherwise be lost due to [[Working Memory Limitations in ADHD]].

This externalisation is a practical application of [[The Extended Mind Thesis]], where the digital system becomes a part of the thinking process itself. A Zettelkasten, for example, serves this purpose, becoming a partner in thought as described in [[Zettelkasten System Essence]]. This approach helps mitigate executive function struggles and allows one to better leverage their cognitive strengths, which is the core [[Purpose of my PKM system]].

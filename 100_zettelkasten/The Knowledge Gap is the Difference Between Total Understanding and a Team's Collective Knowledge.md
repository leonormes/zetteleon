## The Knowledge Gap is the Difference Between Total Understanding and a Team's Collective Knowledge

**Summary:** The "Knowledge Gap" is an external gap representing the portion of a problem that a team cannot solve because the necessary information does not exist within the collective knowledge of its members.

**Details:** In a formal model, if U is the set of all concepts needed to understand a problem, and K_T is the union of all knowledge held by team members, the Knowledge Gap is the difference between the size of U and the size of K_T. It is the set of unknown unknowns that lies outside the team's maximum potential understanding, regardless of how well they communicate.

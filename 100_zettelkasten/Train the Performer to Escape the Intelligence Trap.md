title: Train the Performer to Escape the Intelligence Trap

The solution to [[The Intelligence Trap - Strategist vs Performer]] is not to think your way out of it. The problem is an overactive "Strategist" and an atrophied "Performer," so more thinking will only worsen the imbalance.

The solution is to *train* your way out. This requires a conscious shift in focus: stop feeding the Strategist with more information and start rebuilding the Performer by placing it in the right environment.

This training environment is defined by [[The Performer Upgrade Framework]], which provides the necessary conditions for the Performer to act, learn, and grow stronger over time.

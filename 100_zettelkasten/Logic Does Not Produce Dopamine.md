## Logic Does Not Produce Dopamine

**The Core Insight:** Structure (Logic, Planning, Architecture) acts as a map or steering wheel. It provides *direction* and reduces friction, but it generates zero *propulsion*.

For a neurotypical brain (Importance-Based Nervous System), the logic of "I must do this to avoid consequence X" is often sufficient fuel. For an [[ADHD Brain Operates on an Interest-Based Nervous System|ADHD brain]], logic is "cold." It contains no dopamine.

### The Engine vs. The Steering Wheel
*   **Logic (ProdOS):** The Steering Wheel. It ensures that *if* you move, you move in the right direction.
*   **Dopamine (Interest):** The Engine/Fuel. It provides the [[Activation Energy is the Bottleneck for Productivity|Activation Energy]] to move at all.

### The Failure Mode
A common failure in productivity systems is assuming that a "perfect plan" will result in execution.
*   *Observation:* "I have a perfect list of tasks. Why am I staring at the screen?"
*   *Diagnosis:* You have perfect steering, but an empty tank.

### The Fix: Artificial Ignition
Since logic cannot fuel itself, you must "manufacture" heat using the **Ignition Protocol**:
1.  **Mystery:** Convert a statement into a hypothesis ("I bet I can...").
2.  **Urgency:** Gamify the constraint ("Can I do this in 5 mins?").
3.  **Spite:** Argue against the task to generate friction-based heat.

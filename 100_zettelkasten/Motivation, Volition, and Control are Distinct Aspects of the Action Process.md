# Motivation, Volition, and Control are Distinct Aspects of the Action Process

**Summary:** The process of action can be clarified by distinguishing between three related but distinct concepts: motivation (the drive to act), volition (the deliberate experience of acting), and control (the mastery over the action).

**Details:**
-   **Motivation** is the relationship one has to an action, such as a desire, urge, or intention. It is the "why" behind the action.
-   **Volition** is the subjective experience of doing something deliberately. Not all motivated actions feel volitional; many are performed automatically.
-   **Control** is the subjective experience of mastery and confidence that an action will produce the intended outcome. It applies to both deliberate and automatic actions.

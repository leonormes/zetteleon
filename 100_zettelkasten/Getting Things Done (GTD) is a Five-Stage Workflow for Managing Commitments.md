## Getting Things Done (GTD) is a Five-Stage Workflow for Managing Commitments

**Summary:** David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) is a comprehensive methodology for managing tasks and projects by getting all commitments out of one's head and into a trusted external system.

**Details:** The system is based on a five-stage workflow:
1.  **Capture:** Collect everything that has your attention.
2.  **Clarify:** Process what each item is and if it's actionable.
3.  **Organize:** Put items where they belong (e.g., on a calendar, project list).
4.  **Reflect:** Review your system regularly.
5.  **Engage:** Do the tasks.
Time blocking is a natural technique to use in the "Engage" phase to schedule when actions will be performed.

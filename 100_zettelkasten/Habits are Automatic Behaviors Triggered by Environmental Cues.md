## Habits Are Automatic Behaviors Triggered by Environmental Cues

**Summary:** Habits are automatic behaviors, learned through repetition, that are triggered by stable environmental cues and operate largely outside of conscious awareness.

**Details:** Habits form through a cue-routine-reward loop, where a context (cue) triggers a behavior (routine) that has been previously reinforced (reward). Research shows that up to 43% of daily behaviors are habitual. Once formed, habits are highly efficient as they free up mental resources, but they are also resistant to change through intention alone, as they are controlled by context, not goals.

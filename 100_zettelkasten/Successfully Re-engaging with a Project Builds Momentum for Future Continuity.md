## Successfully Re-engaging with a Project Builds Momentum for Future Continuity

**Summary:** Each time you successfully return to a project after a break, you build evidence that counters the "start fresh" impulse, strengthening the mental pathway for future project continuity.

**Details:** This creates a positive feedback loop. The act of successfully re-engaging proves that it's possible and worthwhile, making it psychologically easier to do so the next time. It reframes project continuity as a skill that can be developed, rather than an innate trait that one either has or doesn't.

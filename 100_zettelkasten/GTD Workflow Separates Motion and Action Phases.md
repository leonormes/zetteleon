**Summary:** The Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology explicitly separates motion-oriented activities (preparation) from action-oriented activities (execution), providing a structured framework for moving from planning to doing.

**Motion-Oriented Components of GTD:**

**1. Capture:**
The initial step of gathering all tasks, ideas, and commitments into an inbox. This is *motion* because it sets the stage for action but doesn't itself produce outcomes. Capturing recognizes "what exists, at deeper and more expanded levels," but doesn't yet act upon it.

**2. Clarify:**
Processing captured items by deciding if they're actionable and what the desired outcome and next action should be. This involves asking:
- "What's my desired outcome?"
- "What's the next action?"

Still largely *motion*, as it involves thinking and decision-making but not execution. It "defines actionable things discretely into outcomes and concrete next steps."

**3. Organize:**
Arranging action reminders and information into appropriate categories (projects, next actions, waiting-for, someday/maybe). This is *motion* as it creates a framework for action without taking action itself.

**4. Review:**
Regular review of lists and projects to assess commitments and make trusted choices about what to do. Reviewing is about "making trusted choices about what to do (and not do) at any moment."

**Action-Oriented Component of GTD:**

**5. Engage (Do):**
The final stage where action occurs. Choosing what to do at any given moment and doing it. This is "the ultimate expression of all six horizons of maintaining perspective."

GTD emphasizes defining the *very next* physical action—making a call, writing an email, going to a shop. This "next action" concept breaks down large projects into concrete, achievable steps.

**Why This Separation Matters:**

**For General Productivity:**
- Clarifies the distinction between planning and executing
- Prevents planning from masquerading as progress
- Ensures motion leads to action rather than endless preparation

**For ADHD:**
The separation is particularly valuable because:
- **Externalizes Executive Functions:** Offloads planning to a systematic process
- **Reduces Cognitive Load:** Separates thinking-intensive work from action
- **Overcomes Initiation Resistance:** Clear next actions remove ambiguity
- **Manages Overwhelm:** Breaking tasks into discrete planning and doing phases

**The Critical Insight:**

GTD recognizes that motion is necessary but insufficient. The workflow is designed to move systematically from motion to action, using the first four stages to enable effective execution in the fifth stage.

**The Danger:**

Getting stuck in motion (Capture, Clarify, Organize, Review) without progressing to action (Engage). The system only works when motion phases feed into doing.

**Practical Application:**

When implementing GTD, consciously track which phase you're in:

- Am I in motion (preparing to work) or action (actually working)?
- Have I completed enough motion to enable action?
- Am I using motion as a procrastination delay tactic?

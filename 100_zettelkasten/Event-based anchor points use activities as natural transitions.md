Event-based anchor points use naturally occurring activities—such as finishing breakfast, completing lunch, or ending a work session—as markers for transitions between different parts of the day, rather than relying on specific clock times.

These anchors leverage the completion of one activity as the trigger for the next, creating a chain of events that flows naturally with the rhythm of daily life. This approach is particularly effective for individuals who experience time blindness or find rigid time-based scheduling anxiety-inducing.

Common event-based anchor points include meal completions, commute endings, specific task completions, or natural energy shifts throughout the day.

"Age Your Money" is the YNAB rule that represents the ultimate goal of the method: breaking the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. The aim is to create a large enough financial buffer that you are spending money earned at least 30 days ago.

Achieving this state provides stability, reduces stress, and gives you time to make thoughtful decisions without the pressure of impending bill deadlines. It is the natural outcome of consistently applying the first three YNAB rules: [[Give Every Dollar a Job (YNAB Rule 1)]], [[Embrace Your True Expenses (YNAB Rule 2)]], and [[Roll With the Punches (YNAB Rule 3)]]. This buffer is the foundation of true financial resilience.

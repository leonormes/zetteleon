**Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. In AI agent workflows, it is a best practice to require agents to document their own changes and decisions in ADRs.

This practice is vital for context retention. When a new agent (or a human developer) works on the project, it can consult the ADRs to understand the "why" behind previous design choices, preventing context loss and redundant work.

The PINCH model is a helpful acronym that summarizes the types of intrinsic motivators that effectively stimulate dopamine production in the ADHD brain, allowing for engagement and focus. These are not just preferences, but neurological necessities for activating the [[The Interest-Based Nervous System in ADHD]].

The motivators are:

- Passion (and Play): Activities that are genuinely joyful or playful.
- Interest: Tasks that are inherently fascinating and captivating.
- Novelty: New, shiny, and exciting experiences.
- Challenge (or Competition/Cooperation): Turning tasks into a challenge or game.
- Hurry (Urgency): Working under a deadline or sense of urgency.

These stimuli are effective because they trigger a sufficient dopamine release to overcome the brain's typical dysregulation.

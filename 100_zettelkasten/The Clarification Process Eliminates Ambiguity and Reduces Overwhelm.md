## The Clarification Process Eliminates Ambiguity and Reduces Overwhelm

**Summary:** The clarification process, which converts vague captured thoughts ("stuff") into atomic actions, eliminates ambiguity, creates immediate momentum, reduces overwhelm, and enables measurable progress.

**Details:** By systematically defining what each item is, what the desired outcome is, and what the very next physical action is, this process transforms mental clutter into clear, actionable steps. This reduces the cognitive load and the feeling of being overwhelmed by an undifferentiated mass of "stuff."

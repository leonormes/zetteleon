When the ADHD brain is not engaged in a stimulating task and gets "stuck" in the [[Task-Positive Network (TPN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) Defined|Default Mode Network (DMN)]], it can become a source of significant distress, often described as a "Demon." This is particularly true when the DMN is active without a positive focus, leading to cycles of negative rumination and self-critical thoughts.

This negative loop is exacerbated by a lifetime of challenging experiences, such as perceived failures and frustrations, which are stored in memory. The DMN can then replay these experiences, contributing to feelings of emptiness, dullness, and even resembling depression.

This phenomenon is closely tied to [[Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)]], an extreme emotional sensitivity to perceived criticism or rejection common in ADHD. The "Demon" of the DMN, therefore, is a manifestation of [[Emotional Dysregulation]], where the "thought battery" is depleted, and thoughts lack their usual positive charge.

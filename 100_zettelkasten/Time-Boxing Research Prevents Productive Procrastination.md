## Time-Boxing Research Prevents Productive Procrastination

**What:** A strategy to counter "productive procrastination" by establishing a firm, external boundary on passive information gathering (Type 1 Information).

**How:**
1.  Before starting research, define a single, specific question to be answered.
2.  Set a timer for a short, fixed duration (e.g., 15-25 minutes).
3.  Focus exclusively on answering that specific question within the allotted time.
4.  When the timer goes off, immediately stop the research and pivot to an action: applying the information found.

**Failure modes:**
-   Starting research without a specific question, leading to aimless browsing.
-   Ignoring the timer and continuing down the "rabbit hole."

**Example (1 max):** To learn a new Terraform function, set a 25-minute timer with the goal: "Find the correct syntax for a for_each loop on a module." When the timer ends, stop reading and immediately start writing the code in your editor. This forces the shift from passive learning to active implementation.

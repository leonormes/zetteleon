# The Need for Emotional Connection Fosters a Sense of Being Known and Accepted

**Summary:** A fundamental human need in a partnership is for emotional connection, which is the feeling of being truly known and accepted by one's partner.

**Details:** This manifests as having a "best friend" you can laugh with and enjoy, as well as having a safe space for vulnerability where one can express fear, doubt, or sadness without being judged or feeling "weak."

[[I have a lot of shame about my life]]

I understand that I have ADHD, but I don't have a point of reference. What is my brain supposed to be like? What is my brain supposed to be doing with tasks and how should it feel about boring things? Why am I considered atypical?

This feeling is a common experience, and the shame often stems from a lifetime of having neurological differences perceived as moral or character failings. This is explained in [[Misinterpretation as Character Flaws]], which is a core component of [[The Roots of Shame and Feeling Defective]].

The question of "why am I atypical?" or "how should my brain feel about boring things?" is answered by understanding the core difference in motivational systems. Your brain isn't broken; it simply operates on a different primary driver.

- [[The ADHD nervous system is primarily interest-driven]], meaning it's activated by tasks that are novel, challenging, or personally interesting.
- In contrast, [[Neurotypical motivation is primarily importance-driven]], allowing for action based on a task's perceived importance or future rewards, even without immediate interest.

The struggle with boring tasks isn't a personal failing, but a predictable outcome of an interest-based nervous system interacting with a world largely designed for importance-based motivation. Other related challenges, like [[Consistency and Momentum]] and [[Perfectionism]], also stem from these neurological differences rather than character.

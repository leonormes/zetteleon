Resilience is the psychological capacity to adapt to and recover from stress, adversity, trauma, or disappointment.

It is often described as the ability to "bounce back" after a difficult experience. Resilience is not about avoiding hardship, but about navigating through it and emerging without lasting negative effects.

It is a dynamic process that involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions that can be learned and developed by anyone.

Fixed-schedule productivity is a strict implementation of timeboxing where every minute of the workday is planned in advance, and a hard stop time is established.

This approach creates artificial constraints that force efficiency and focus. By deciding ahead of time what to do and when, you eliminate unstructured time where distraction can creep in. The fixed end time for the workday prevents tasks from expanding indefinitely, creating pressure to complete work within the allotted container.

This method is particularly effective for those who tend to let work bleed into personal time or who struggle with procrastination in unstructured environments.

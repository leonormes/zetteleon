title: Semantic Diffusion Creates False Alignment

Semantic diffusion occurs when a team uses the same vocabulary to describe different underlying concepts, creating a false sense of alignment.

For example, team members might all agree to add more "replicas," but one person's mental model is of Kubernetes ReplicaSets, another's is of a read-only database replica with replication lag, and a third's is of a simple backup copy. All parties agree on the term but have a completely different picture of the work, leading to integration failures and mismatched expectations.

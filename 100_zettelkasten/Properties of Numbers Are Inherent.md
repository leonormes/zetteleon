title: Properties of Numbers Are Inherent

The properties of a number are intrinsic to the abstract concept of that number, not a consequence of the symbols we use to represent it.

For example, the primality of the number 7 is a fundamental truth about the concept of "sevenness." It reflects the fact that a collection of seven items cannot be arranged into any equal-sized groups (other than one group of seven or seven groups of one).

This property exists regardless of whether we write it as '7', 'VII', or in binary as '111'. We **discover** that 7 is prime; we do not decide it.

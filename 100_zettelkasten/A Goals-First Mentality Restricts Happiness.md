## A Goals-First Mentality Restricts Happiness

**Summary:** A goals-first mentality restricts happiness by creating an implicit assumption that satisfaction can only be achieved once the goal is reached.

**Details:** This approach perpetually postpones happiness, creating an "either-or" conflict: either you achieve your goal and are happy, or you fail and are a disappointment. In contrast, a systems-first approach allows for satisfaction anytime the system is running. By falling in love with the process, happiness is found in the work itself, not delayed until a future outcome is realized.

## Active Recall Strengthens Memory Through Retrieval Practice

**Summary:** Active recall is the practice of actively retrieving information from memory during the learning process, which strengthens memory pathways more effectively than passive review.

**Implementation methods:**
- Flashcards (traditional or digital)
- Self-quizzing
- Closed-book summarization
- Teaching concepts without notes

**Why it works:**
- Retrieval practice creates stronger memory traces
- Identifies gaps in knowledge effectively
- Mimics real-world application where recall is required

**Cognitive Context:**
Works best when paired with [[Diffuse vs Focused Thinking Modes]] cycles:
1. Focused encoding
2. Diffuse consolidation
3. Focused retrieval

**Research findings:**
- More effective than passive rereading
- Benefits persist across age groups and subject areas
- Works well in combination with spaced repetition

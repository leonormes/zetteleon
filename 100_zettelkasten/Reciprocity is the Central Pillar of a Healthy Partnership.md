# Reciprocity is the Central Pillar of a Healthy Partnership

**Summary:** In a healthy partnership, the expectations one partner has for the other should be the same expectations they are willing to meet themselves.

**Details:** This principle of mutuality applies to nearly all aspects of a relationship, from emotional support to shared responsibilities. It ensures a balanced and fair dynamic where both partners contribute and benefit, preventing one-sidedness and resentment.

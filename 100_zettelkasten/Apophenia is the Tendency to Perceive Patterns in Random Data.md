## Apophenia is the Tendency to Perceive Patterns in Random Data

**Summary:** Apophenia, or patternicity, is the tendency to perceive meaningful connections within random or meaningless data.

**Details:** This cognitive bias is a byproduct of the brain's powerful pattern-seeking drive. It manifests as pareidolia (seeing faces in clouds), the gambler's fallacy, and the clustering illusion. Cognitively, it is a "Type I error" or a false positive—believing a pattern is real when it is not. This tendency is a normal feature of human cognition, though it can be more pronounced in certain mental health conditions.

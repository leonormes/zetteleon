title: Discreteness as a Precondition for Counting
type:

For the act of counting and the concept of number to be meaningful, the universe must contain **distinction** or **discreteness**. We must be able to perceive separate, distinct things.

Counting requires the ability to identify an object and distinguish it from its background and from other objects. It is the fundamental difference between what is **discrete** (countable, like apples) and what is **continuous** (an unbroken whole, like a flow of water).

Without separation, there is no quantity. This is explored in [[The Continuum Thought Experiment]].

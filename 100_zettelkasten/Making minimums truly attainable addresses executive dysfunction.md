Making minimums truly attainable addresses executive dysfunction by setting the bar for "success" low enough that it remains achievable even during periods of severe executive function impairment, while still maintaining the routine structure that prevents complete habit collapse.

Executive dysfunction can make even basic tasks feel insurmountable—the activation energy required to start anything exceeds available capacity. Traditional routines fail during these periods because they demand more than the brain can deliver, leading to complete abandonment and subsequent guilt spirals.

By explicitly planning minimum routines where "feeding yourself counts as a win," you create a success pathway that works with severely impaired executive function rather than against it. The minimum might be literally just brushing teeth and eating something—anything that maintains the habit's existence without requiring heroic effort.

This strategy recognizes that maintaining any version of a routine during dysfunction periods preserves the habit infrastructure. When executive function returns, you haven't lost weeks rebuilding from zero—you've maintained a baseline that can be scaled back up.

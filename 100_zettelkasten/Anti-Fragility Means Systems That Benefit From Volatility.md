## Anti-Fragility Means Systems That Benefit From Volatility

**Summary:** Anti-fragility is the property of systems that gain from disorder rather than merely resisting it, converting volatility into growth.

By building in optionality, redundancy, and small, reversible bets, you convert volatility into information and upside while limiting downside. Stressors become signals that guide adaptation instead of threats to be eliminated. This design principle makes uncertainty a resource for growth.

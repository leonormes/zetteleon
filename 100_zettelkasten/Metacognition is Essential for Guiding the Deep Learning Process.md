## Metacognition is Essential for Guiding the Deep Learning Process

**Summary:** Metacognition, the capacity to "think about one's own thinking," is essential for navigating the journey from fleeting comprehension to robust knowledge.

**Details:** Metacognition involves planning learning approaches, monitoring comprehension, and assessing the effectiveness of one's understanding. Effective learners use metacognitive strategies to identify when they do not understand material and to adjust their learning strategies accordingly, such as by seeking clarification, generating questions, or applying more effortful techniques.

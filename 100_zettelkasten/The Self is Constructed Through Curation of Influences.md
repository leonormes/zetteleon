## The Self is Constructed Through Curation of Influences

**Summary:** The self is an ongoing editorial process that selects, filters, and integrates influences; agency shows up in curation.

**Details:** The self is not a raw, unmediated essence but an ongoing editorial process that selects, filters, and integrates influences. You absorb languages, models, and norms, yet through reflection and practice you decide which to foreground, which to discard, and how to combine them. Agency shows up in curation: choosing inputs, environments, and exemplars that shape your trajectory. This constructive view treats consciousness as an active maker of meaning rather than a passive recipient.

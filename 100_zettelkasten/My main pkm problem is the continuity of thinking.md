How do I find my latest thoughts on the json-ld metadata? This is a red herring. I am creating problems that are interrupting me from just using writing simply in the moment to straighten out my thinking. So I currently struggle to find previous thoughts. Doesn't mean I can't at least get thinking on the moment done. I should do this especially for work.

I'm still struggling with continuing my thinking. I do this quick bullet point thing. But at a later date when I have similar thoughts they are not automatically surfaced and compared. It would be good if I had a copilot that pointed out previous text about the same thing. To help me find patterns that I can then challenge.

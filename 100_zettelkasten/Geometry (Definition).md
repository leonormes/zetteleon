**Definition:** Geometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties, measurement, and relationships of points, lines, surfaces, and solids in space.

**Foundational Pattern:** Geometry arises from observing the arrangement of objects relative to one another in space—notions of closeness, distance, angle, and dimension.

**Classical Form:** Euclidean geometry studies the rigid structure of Euclidean space (ℝⁿ), defined by axioms governing points, lines, and distances, as codified in Euclid's Elements.

**Extensions:** Modern geometry encompasses non-Euclidean geometries (hyperbolic, elliptic), differential geometry (curved spaces), and algebraic geometry (geometric objects defined by equations).

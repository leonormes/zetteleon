**Definition:** Arithmetic is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties and manipulation of numbers, particularly the natural numbers and integers, through basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Foundational Pattern:** Arithmetic emerges from the discrete, ordered sequence of counting—one thing, then another, then another—giving rise to the structure of natural numbers ℕ = {0, 1, 2, ...} with the successor operation.

**Core Operations:** The fundamental operations (addition, multiplication) and their inverses (subtraction, division) define arithmetic's basic computational toolkit.

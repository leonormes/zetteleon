A mental model is a simplified internal representation of a complex external reality. We rely on these models to solve problems and make decisions.

However, when a mental model is flawed or incomplete—even if it produces correct answers for common scenarios—it creates a hard ceiling on our capabilities. We become trapped by a "useful fiction," unable to solve novel problems, innovate, or debug issues that fall outside the model's safe boundaries. This is because the model's success in familiar situations prevents it from being challenged, leading to a false belief that our understanding is complete.

This phenomenon is compounded in teams, where the [[The Illusion of Shared Understanding in Teams|illusion of a shared mental model]] can hide critical misalignments that only surface during a crisis.

[[Bug in the model]]

A flawed mental model is a simplified or incorrect internal representation of a complex system. While often useful as an [[Effective Theory]] for solving common problems, it ultimately limits mastery and innovation by creating a capability ceiling.

The core idea is captured by the aphorism [[The Map is Not the Territory]]. Our models are maps, not the reality they represent.

# The Knowing-Doing Gap Describes Organizational Failure to Act on Knowledge

**Summary:** The "knowing-doing gap," documented by Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton, describes the common phenomenon where organizations know what they should do but consistently fail to act on that knowledge.

**Details:** This gap arises from several common organizational dysfunctions. These include substituting talk for action (where meetings and presentations become a substitute for implementation), a culture of fear that prevents new approaches, destructive internal competition, measuring the wrong metrics, and promoting leaders who do not understand the actual work of the organization.

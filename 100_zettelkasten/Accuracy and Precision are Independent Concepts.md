title: Accuracy and Precision are Independent Concepts

Accuracy and precision are two independent concepts in measurement. A set of measurements can be one without the other, though the ideal is to be both accurate and precise.

- **Precise but Not Accurate**: Measurements are consistent and close to each other, but far from the true value. This indicates a systematic error.
- **Accurate but Not Precise**: Measurements are scattered, but their average is close to the true value. This indicates the presence of random error.
- **Neither**: Measurements are scattered and their average is not close to the true value.
- **Both**: Measurements are tightly clustered around the true value.

Understanding this distinction is a crucial mental model for avoiding cognitive biases. For example, we might precisely (consistently) find evidence that confirms our beliefs, without checking if that evidence is accurate (true).

The difference is often visualized using [[The Target Analogy for Accuracy and Precision]].

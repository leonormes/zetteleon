An LLM can be used as a powerful tool for thought. It acts as an intellectual "mirror," reflecting a user's ideas back to them in a clarified, structured, or expanded form.

The validation one feels from this interaction is a byproduct of the successful use of this tool. The feeling arises because the user has managed to articulate a complex concept, and the tool has successfully parsed and reflected it, allowing for a stimulating exchange that can lead to new insights. The meaning and success of the exchange reside in the user's ability, which the tool helped to unlock.

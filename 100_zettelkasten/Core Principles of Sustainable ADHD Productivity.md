## Core Principles of Sustainable ADHD Productivity

Sustainable productivity for ADHD is not about finding the perfect planner or forcing a rigid routine. It is built on a foundation of five core principles that prioritize self-awareness, alignment, and realistic capacity management.

### The Five Pillars

1. **Self-Awareness**: The foundation is a deep understanding of your own unique patterns, strengths, weaknesses, and values. This involves tracking energy levels and recognizing what truly motivates you, allowing you to design a system that fits you, not the other way around.
2. **Clarity on What You Want**: Productivity must be aligned with genuine personal desires, not just a sense of obligation or "busyness." The focus should be on finding fulfillment in the *process*, not just the outcome. This requires regularly asking if the journey is worth the effort.
3. **Systems Over Goals**: Rigid, outcome-driven goals can be demotivating for the ADHD brain. It is more effective to build frictionless, repeatable *systems* that align with your natural tendencies. The goal is to make small, consistent changes that are enjoyable and sustainable, rather than relying on bursts of hyperfocus.
4. **Intentional Planning Framework**: Use a simple, repeatable planning framework (e.g., monthly, weekly, daily) to consciously direct your energy toward your own priorities, rather than reacting to external urgencies. This is about proactively choosing your focus.
5. **Managing Capacity**: Capacity is more than just time; it includes energy, attention, and resources. Before taking on new commitments, you must realistically assess your available capacity. This means replacing self-critical stories of "laziness" with a practical, adaptive approach to managing your workload.

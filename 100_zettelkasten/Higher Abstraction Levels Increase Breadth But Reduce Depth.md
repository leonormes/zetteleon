## Higher Abstraction Levels Increase Breadth But Reduce Depth

**Summary:** Moving to higher levels of abstraction reveals broader patterns and connections across domains while sacrificing detailed, context-specific knowledge.

**Key Aspects:**
- **Breadth:** General models apply to wider range of cases
- **Depth:** Specific implementations require lower abstraction
- **Tradeoff:** Cannot maximize both simultaneously

**Examples:**
- Mathematics: Group theory vs arithmetic
- Mapping: Country view vs street view
- Programming: Python vs assembly language

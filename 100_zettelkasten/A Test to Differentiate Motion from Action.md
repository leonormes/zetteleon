To determine if an activity is productive action or merely motion-as-procrastination, ask the following question:

**"If I stopped this activity right now, would I be any closer to my goal?"**

If the answer is no, the activity is likely motion. If the answer is yes, it is likely action.

This question cuts through the feeling of being busy and focuses on tangible progress. An hour spent outlining a book (motion) leaves you with an outline, but no finished pages. An hour spent writing (action) leaves you with a page, which is a tangible step closer to a finished book.

To make habits stick, individuals with ADHD benefit greatly from building in immediate feedback or reward loops. Because the ADHD brain is motivated by immediate consequences, creating a small, instant reward for completing a habit can significantly strengthen the neural pathway and increase the likelihood of repetition.

## Example Application: Daily Writing

For a daily writing habit, an immediate reward could be ticking off the session in a tracking app, sharing a single interesting sentence with a friend, or simply savoring a cup of tea after the writing sprint is complete. The key is that the reward is immediate and directly linked to the completion of the habit.

title: ADHD is a Heterogeneous Condition with Unique Symptom Patterns

ADHD is a heterogeneous condition, meaning its presentation varies significantly from person to person. A network analysis study found that 91.8% of individuals with ADHD had a unique symptom pattern, with 116,220 possible combinations. This highlights that the "average ADHD patient" has limited informative value and that a one-size-fits-all approach to understanding or treating ADHD is inappropriate.

The common motivational strategies of emphasizing a task's importance or offering external rewards often fail for individuals with ADHD. This is due to a combination of neurological and cognitive factors.

1. **Neurological Reasons:** The primary cause is [[Dopamine Dysregulation is a Key Factor in ADHD Motivation]]. The ADHD brain's reward circuits do not activate sufficiently for tasks lacking intrinsic interest. "Shoulds," duty, or fear of consequences are often not enough to trigger the necessary dopamine response for task initiation. This leads to a preference for smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones.
2. **Executive Function Challenges:** Deficits in [[Executive Function Challenges are Central to ADHD]] prevent the translation of intention into action. Difficulties with initiation (ADHD paralysis), time management, and prioritization make tasks feel overwhelming, which further reduces motivation.

## What Works Instead

- [[The PINCH Model Describes Core ADHD Motivators]]: Harness intrinsic drivers (Passion/Play, Interest, Novelty, Challenge, Hurry) to activate engagement.
- Immediate, concrete rewards: Prefer proximal, meaningful reinforcement over distant abstractions.
- Align tasks with interest or novelty: Reframe or gamify to increase salience for the interest-based nervous system.

## Related Challenges

## Broader Context

- [[ADHD and Motivation MOC]]

The subjective experience of reward is also different, as explored in [[The 'Dopamine Shot' vs 'Relief from Anxiety' in Task Completion]].

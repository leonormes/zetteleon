title: Balanced relationships involve active listening remembering events offering help and sharing conversation time
type: concept

In balanced, healthy relationships, people typically demonstrate several key behaviors that indicate appropriate levels of other-focus:

1. **Active listening** - Paying attention when others speak, though attention may drift sometimes
2. **Memory of important events** - Remembering significant occasions and details in others' lives
3. **Offering support** - Providing help or support when noticing someone struggling
4. **Considering preferences** - Taking others' preferences into account when making shared plans
5. **Conversation balance** - Sharing conversation time relatively equally between participants

These patterns represent typical social reciprocity in mutually satisfying relationships.

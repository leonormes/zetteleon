**Summary:** Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems (1931) demonstrated fundamental limitations of formal systems, showing that any system strong enough to contain basic arithmetic will have true statements it cannot prove and cannot prove its own consistency.

**Details:**

Kurt Gödel's work profoundly impacted foundational programs in mathematics:

- **First Incompleteness Theorem:** Any consistent formal system powerful enough to express basic arithmetic contains statements that are true but unprovable within that system.
- **Second Incompleteness Theorem:** No consistent formal system can prove its own consistency from within.

**Implications:**

These theorems dealt severe blows to both Logicism and Formalism. They showed that:

1. Mathematics cannot be reduced to a complete logical system (challenging Logicism)
2. The consistency of formal systems cannot be proven internally (challenging Hilbert's formalist program)

The theorems revealed inherent limitations in the foundationalist project while paradoxically demonstrating the power of mathematical reasoning itself.

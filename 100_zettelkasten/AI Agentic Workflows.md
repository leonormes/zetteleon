**AI Agentic Workflows** are systems where AI agents perform tasks with some degree of autonomy, often involving planning, tool use, and iteration to achieve a goal. Unlike simple prompt-response models, agentic systems engage in multi-step reasoning and can interact with their environment, such as a virtual file system or external APIs.

The reliability of these workflows in production is a significant challenge, necessitating structured approaches like Test-Driven Development for AI Agents and an Architecture-First Approach to AI Development. The complexity and capability of these workflows can be classified into [[Levels of Agentic Behaviour]].

Effective agentic systems depend heavily on [[Context Engineering for LLMs]] to manage the information they process at each step, avoiding common failure modes like distraction or hallucination.

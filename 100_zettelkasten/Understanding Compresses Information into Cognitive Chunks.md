## Understanding Compresses Information into Cognitive Chunks

**Summary:** True understanding acts as a lossy compression algorithm, extracting patterns from raw data to create efficient mental models that reduce cognitive load.

**Mechanisms:**
- Identifies underlying principles
- Discards redundant details
- Creates predictive models

**Benefits:**
- Overcomes working memory limits
- Enables problem-solving
- Facilitates knowledge transfer

# Discipline Relies on External Supports Not Just Willpower

**Summary:** True discipline is not purely a matter of internal willpower but is heavily reliant on external supports such as environment, culture, incentives, and interpersonal accountability.

**Details:** Willpower alone is often insufficient for achieving long-term goals. Both ancient and modern societies have used versions of "external structure" to make sustained effort less punishing and more reliable. This suggests that creating a supportive environment is a more effective strategy than simply trying harder.

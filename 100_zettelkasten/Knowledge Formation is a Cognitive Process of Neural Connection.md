## Knowledge Formation is a Cognitive Process of Neural Connection

**Summary:** From a neuroscience perspective, the transformation of information into knowledge involves forming and strengthening new neural connections within the brain.

**Details:** This cognitive process engages multiple brain regions responsible for memory, reasoning, and decision-making. New information is integrated with existing cognitive structures by forming new pathways. Processes like sleep and reflection are crucial for consolidating these connections, which embeds the information more deeply and transforms it into usable knowledge.

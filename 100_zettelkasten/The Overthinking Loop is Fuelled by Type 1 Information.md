title: The Overthinking Loop is Fuelled by Type 1 Information
type:
uid:

The overthinking loop is a cognitive-behavioural cycle where an individual avoids taking action by endlessly gathering theoretical ([[Type 1 Information is Theoretical]]) knowledge. This avoidance of generating real-world feedback ([[Type 2 Information is Experiential]]) increases anxiety, which in turn drives the person to seek more "safe" theoretical information, reinforcing the loop.

This cycle generates mental noise, not clarity, and is a primary driver of [[Executive Dysfunction - The Root of Analysis Paralysis]]. Breaking the loop requires intentionally taking small actions to generate Type 2 feedback.

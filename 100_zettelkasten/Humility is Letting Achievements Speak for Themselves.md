Humility is the quality of being modest and having a low view of one's own importance. It is not about thinking less of yourself, but about thinking of yourself less.

A humble person does not show off or boast; they let their actions and achievements speak for themselves. This strength allows for a greater appreciation of others' contributions and a more accurate self-assessment.

Humility is a key component of wisdom and is essential for continuous learning and personal growth.

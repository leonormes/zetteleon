ADHD brains process emotions differently, leading to "intense or unpredictable emotions that seem blown out of proportion". These are not chosen behaviors, but rather a result of differences in brain function, particularly in the amygdala and frontal cortex. This means your emotional responses are often automatic and not a reflection of your character. Trying to directly control feelings is often futile; instead, focus on managing your behavior in response to them.

## Extending the Idea

- A Specific Manifestation: A core example of this is [[Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)]], where the emotional response to perceived rejection is intensely amplified.
- Impact on Decision-Making: This dysregulation magnifies the pain of being wrong, which helps explain why [[The Emotional Cost of Being Wrong is Magnified by Loss Aversion]] and can lead to risk-averse behaviors.
- A Practical Coping Strategy: Since behavior is what can be managed, a key strategy is to [[Decoupling Ego from Outcomes to Improve Decisions]], separating self-worth from the results of actions.
- A Guiding Principle: The core philosophy here is that [[Your emotions are real but they are your responsibility]]. This validates the feeling while empowering agency over the response.
- An Existential Reframe: The constant struggle can feel absurd, but reframing it through the lens of [[The Myth of Sisyphus as an Absurd Hero]] can turn a feeling of futility into one of heroic resilience.
- [[Morita Therapy - Applications for Anxiety, Perfectionism, and ADHD]] provides a framework for taking action despite emotional dysregulation.

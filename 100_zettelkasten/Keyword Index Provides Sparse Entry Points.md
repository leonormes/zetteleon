## Keyword Index Provides Sparse Entry Points

**Summary:** The keyword index links selected keywords (topics, themes, emotions) to one or two notes that serve as entry points into specific lines of thought. Luhmann kept his index deliberately sparse to induce serendipity.

**Details:** Luhmann's keyword index was intentionally minimalist—typically only one to four references per keyword. This sparseness serves a crucial function: it forces you to enter the network through just a few notes, then follow links to discover related ideas. Dense indexing (listing every note mentioning a keyword) defeats the purpose by bypassing the discovery process. The index maps keywords to note IDs that initiate trains of thought. For example, the keyword "creativity" might point to note 3a1, which links to a network of connected ideas about creative process. The genius is that you don't index every note about creativity—you index the best entry point, then trust the network's links to guide further exploration. This creates productive serendipity: you might enter looking for creativity, but following links leads you to unexpected connections with systems thinking or cognitive psychology. The sparse index embodies the principle that value comes from exploring the network, not from comprehensive retrieval. Modern digital systems often add search functionality, but the principle of sparse, curated entry points remains valuable.

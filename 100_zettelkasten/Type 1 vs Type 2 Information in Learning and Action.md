There are two fundamental types of information that drive different learning and behavioral patterns:

## Core Distinction

- **[[Type 1 Information is Theoretical]]**: Knowledge acquired passively through consumption (reading, watching, planning). Provides mental models but no real-world validation.
- **[[Type 2 Information is Experiential]]**: Knowledge gained through direct experience and action. Provides context-specific feedback that cannot be obtained theoretically.

## Behavioral Patterns

- **[[Information Addiction in Overthinkers]]**: How Type 1 information becomes compulsively consumed as a substitute for action
- **[[Experiential Information Avoidance]]**: Why Type 2 information is often feared and avoided despite its necessity for growth

## Key Insights

Both types are necessary, but problems arise when Type 1 information substitutes for rather than prepares for Type 2 engagement. The balance between theoretical preparation and experiential learning determines the effectiveness of personal and professional development.

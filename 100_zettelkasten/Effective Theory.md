An effective theory is a model of the world that is highly accurate and predictive within a specific, limited domain, even if its foundational principles are known to be incomplete or incorrect on a deeper level.

[[Newtonian Physics as an Effective Theory]] is the classic example; it works for everyday scales but is superseded by General Relativity.

Similarly, the mental model of [[Number As Symbol is a Flawed Initial Mental Model]] is an effective theory for elementary school arithmetic. Its success in that domain hides its foundational flaws, which only become apparent when the domain is expanded to include the full set of real numbers.

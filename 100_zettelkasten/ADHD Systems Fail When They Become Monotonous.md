**Summary:** The very systems and processes people with ADHD implement to manage their condition often fall victim to the hyperfixation-burnout cycle. Systems fail not because of personal failure, but because routine maintenance becomes monotonous and stops providing dopamine rewards.

**The Pattern:**

1. **Initial Hyperfixation:** Person discovers a new planner, productivity app, or organizational method
2. **Intense Setup:** Research it obsessively, set it up with intense focus and excitement
3. **The "Solution" Feeling:** For days or weeks, it feels like the perfect system is finally in place
4. **Novelty Fades:** The routine maintenance required becomes monotonous
5. **System Abandoned:** During the crash, the system becomes just another "vague and empty" task

**Why Systems Become Victims:**

- **Routine is Inherently Monotonous:** By definition, a system requires repeated, predictable actions
- **Maintenance Lacks Novelty:** Once set up, using the system is familiar and provides no dopamine hits
- **Setup vs. Maintenance:** The exciting part is creating and learning the system; using it is boring
- **No Intrinsic Interest:** The system itself is not intrinsically interesting—it's a tool, not the goal

**The Reframe:**

Understanding this dynamic requires reframing the "failure":

- **You are not failing the system**
- **The system is failing to keep your brain sufficiently stimulated**
- This is a predictable outcome of how the ADHD brain functions
- The problem is not lack of discipline or commitment

**Strategic Implications:**

Recognizing this pattern is the first step toward designing ADHD-compatible systems. Rather than trying harder to maintain boring systems, the solution is to build novelty and flexibility into the systems themselves.

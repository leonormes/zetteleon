To build consistency into a routine, establish "anchor times" for a few critical tasks throughout the day. These are fixed points around which more flexible activities can be arranged.

Typical anchor times include waking up, eating meals, or starting a work block. By fixing these key events, you create a predictable skeleton for the day. Rituals can then be built around these anchors to further solidify the routine. For example, a morning anchor might include a sequence of activities like exercise, meditation, and breakfast. This approach provides structure without demanding that every minute of the day be rigidly scheduled.

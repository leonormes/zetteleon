**Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind** is the principle of personal leadership. It means starting each day, task, or project with a clear vision of your desired destination. It is the habit of creating a personal mission statement or philosophy.

This habit is based on the principle that all things are created twice:

1. **The Mental Creation:** The first creation is intellectual, in the mind. You define what you want to accomplish.
2. **The Physical Creation:** The second creation is the physical production of the thing you envisioned.

[[Habit 1 - Be Proactive]] says "You are the creator." Habit 2 is the first creation. It's about ensuring your actions are guided by a clear, personal compass.

## ProdOS Integration

This habit is the core of the upper levels of the [[05 - Horizons of Focus]] model, specifically **Horizon 5 (Purpose & Principles)** and **Horizon 4 (Vision)**. It is about defining your [[12 - Core Principles and Values]] before you begin to act.

In the [[03 - ProdOS (Productivity Operating System)]], this is formalized through commands like `/plan-life-vision`, which are designed to help articulate this personal constitution. The [[07 - LLM as a Productivity Partner (CoS)]] facilitates this process of mental creation.

Once the vision is set, the next step is to manage your time and actions to make that vision a reality, which is the focus of [[Habit 3 - Put First Things First]].

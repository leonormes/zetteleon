Emotion acts as the brain's primary valuation system, tagging information with importance and marking it for memory and inclusion in long-term mental models.

## How Emotion Influences Model Building

**Emotional Intensity**: Events tied to strong emotions—fear, joy, anger, love—are seared into memory. The brain operates on the principle that if an event triggered a strong emotion, it must be important for survival and future decision-making.

**Affective Association**: Feelings and moods act as a constant filter. When feeling happy, you're more likely to notice and remember positive details, building a more optimistic mental model of an event. The reverse is true when feeling down.

**The Amygdala's Role**: The amygdala, a key emotion-processing centre, works directly with the hippocampus (memory formation) to strengthen encoding of emotionally charged events. It essentially tells the hippocampus, "This one matters. Save it and link it to everything else."

## Evolutionary Basis

The brain's filtering system was shaped by evolution and is hardwired to prioritise information relevant to survival and reproduction:

- **Threats and Dangers**: We are exceptionally good at noticing and modelling potential threats
- **Social Information**: Information about social hierarchies, trustworthiness, and relationships receives extremely high priority
- **Resources**: We are predisposed to pay attention to potential resources like food, water, and shelter

This explains why emotional events create more detailed and persistent mental models than mundane experiences.

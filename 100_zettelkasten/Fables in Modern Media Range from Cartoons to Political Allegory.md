In the 20th and 21st centuries, the fable form has been adapted into a wide range of modern media, demonstrating its enduring flexibility.

Early examples include animated cartoons from the 1920s, such as Disney's Silly Symphonies, which often used animal characters to tell simple moral tales, much like the original Aesopic fables.

A more complex and politically charged example is George Orwell's 1945 novella, *Animal Farm*. This work uses the structure of a fable, with talking animals on a farm, to create a powerful allegory for the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism.

These examples show how the core device of the fable—animal allegory—continues to be used for both simple moral instruction and sophisticated social and political commentary.

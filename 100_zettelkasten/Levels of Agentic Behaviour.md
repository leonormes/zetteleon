The capabilities of [[AI Agentic Workflows]] can be classified into different levels of sophistication and autonomy:

- **L0: No Explicit Reasoning**: Logic is handled entirely at the prompt level. This is characteristic of simple, single-shot LLM calls.
- **L1: Basic Tool Use**: The agent can make simple decisions about which tools to use. Most current production systems operate at this level.
- **L2: Structured Reasoning**: The agent can create multi-step plans, perform sequential actions, and incorporate feedback loops. This level is rapidly emerging in production.
- **L3: Proactive Agents**: The agent is continuous and can react to changes in its environment or state without direct user prompting. This is still rare.
- **L4: Inventive AI**: The agent can create new tools and workflows autonomously to solve problems. This is currently theoretical and aligns with concepts of AGI.

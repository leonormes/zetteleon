This note summarizes the reasons why task initiation is so difficult for individuals with ADHD, and the behavioral interventions that can help.

## Why Task Initiation Is Difficult

- **Executive Dysfunction**: [[Executive Function Challenges are Central to ADHD|Executive dysfunction]] impairs planning, prioritizing, and organizing tasks.
- **Low Dopamine Reward**: [[Dopamine Dysregulation is a Key Factor in ADHD Motivation|Low dopamine in the reward centers]] makes tasks feel unmotivating.
- **Interest-Based Nervous System**: The [[The Interest-Based Nervous System in ADHD|ADHD nervous system is interest-based]], requiring tasks to be novel, urgent, or meaningful.
- **Emotional Barriers**: [[Emotional Dysregulation|Emotional barriers]] like anxiety and overwhelm can block initiation.
- **Time Blindness**: [[ADHD Time Blindness Impairs Planning|Difficulty perceiving the passage of time]] makes planning and starting tasks harder.
- **Activation Cost**: [[The Activation Cost of Tasks is Higher in ADHD|The mental energy required to start a task is higher]].

## Behavioral Interventions

[[Behavioral Interventions for ADHD Compensate for Neurobiological Deficits|Effective behavioral interventions compensate for these neurobiological differences]].

- **Micro-Stepping**: [[Micro-Stepping Reduces Cognitive Load for Task Initiation|Breaking tasks into micro-steps]] lowers the activation cost.
- **External Cues**: Using [[Environmental and Physical Hacks for ADHD Focus|external cues]] like timers and alarms bypasses unreliable internal timing.
- **Behavioral Momentum**: [[Momentum-Building Strategies for ADHD|Starting with an easy task]] can build momentum for harder ones.
- **Reward the Start**: [[Rewarding the Start of a Task Provides Immediate Reinforcement for ADHD|Rewarding the start of a task]], not just the finish, provides immediate reinforcement.
- **Social Structures**: [[Body Doubling for ADHD Focus|Body doubling]] and accountability partners provide external motivation.

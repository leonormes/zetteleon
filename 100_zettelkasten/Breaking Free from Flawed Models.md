[[Bug in the model]]

Overcoming the limitations of a flawed mental model requires a conscious effort to challenge and rebuild one's understanding. This involves moving from an [[Instrumentalism vs Realism in Understanding|instrumentalist]] ("it works") to a realist ("it's true") viewpoint.

Methods include:

1. **Embrace First Principles**: Deconstruct abstractions to understand how they truly work. Go beyond the API and read the source code.
2. **Seek Out Edge Cases**: Intentionally test the limits of your model. Ask "when does this break?" This is where [[Leaky Abstractions]] reveal themselves.
3. **Cultivate Intellectual Humility**: Recognise that your model is incomplete. The belief that your understanding is complete is the biggest barrier to learning.
4. **Draw Analogies from Other Fields**: Using concepts from physics or maths can help challenge assumptions in technology, and vice versa.

Our entire conversation on the nature of number has been an exercise in this process.

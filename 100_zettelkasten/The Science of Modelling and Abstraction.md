The concept of a "model" extends far beyond the mental models in our heads. The science of **modelling** is a fundamental practice across all scientific disciplines, and its core principle is **abstraction**.

Abstraction is the art of intentional simplification. To create a useful model, one must decide what is essential to the problem and what is unnecessary detail that can be ignored. The goal is to capture the essence of a complex reality in a simplified, tractable form.

- A physicist's model of a falling apple ignores air resistance to reveal the simple, powerful laws of gravity.
- An economist's model of a market ignores individual personalities to focus on the abstract relationship between supply and demand.

These models are all technically "wrong" because they are incomplete, but their value comes from this very incompleteness. By stripping away complexity, they reveal underlying patterns and relationships.

This universal principle connects all types of models, from our internal mental models to formal mathematical ones. They are all attempts to create a useful "map" of an impossibly complex "territory," as stated in [[All Models Are Wrong But Some Are Useful]].

## A Startup Ritual Eases the Transition into a Project Mindset

**Summary:** A "startup ritual" is a brief, consistent sequence of actions performed at the beginning of a work session to signal to the brain that it's time to focus on a specific project.

**Details:** This ritual acts as a buffer between other activities and deep work. It could be as simple as opening specific applications, putting on a particular playlist, and reviewing the "Future Self Brief." The consistency of the ritual helps automate the transition into the project's mental context.

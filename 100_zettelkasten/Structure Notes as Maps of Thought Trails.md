title: Structure Notes as Maps of Thought Trails

In a PKM that embraces [[Writing as a Thinking Tool]], the role of the polished, summary-style note changes. It is no longer the final product or the primary artifact of value. Instead, it becomes a **Structure Note** (or Map of Content) that serves as a high-level guide to the messy, authentic thinking process that produced it.

Instead of a single, conclusive "wiki entry," you have a network of smaller, more personal atomic notes capturing the journey:

- The initial question or frustration.
- The first tentative hypothesis.
- The discovery of a formal term.
- The deeper analysis of the feeling or problem.

The Structure Note then sits on top of this network, linking to these atomic notes in a logical narrative. It provides a clean entry point and a coherent story, but its value comes from the rich, contextual, and personal thought-trail it organizes.

This approach transforms the polished note from a static conclusion into a dynamic map of your thinking. This aligns with the concept of MOCs in the [[08 - Obsidian for PKM]] framework, where they serve as curated entry points into a web of ideas.

## Conceptual Change is the Deep Process of Restructuring Misconceptions

**Summary:** Conceptual change is the process of revising pre-existing alternative conceptions, or misconceptions, to align with scientifically accepted explanations.

**Details:** This is not merely adding new information but involves a substantial and often challenging restructuring of an individual's mental representation of a concept. For conceptual change to occur, a learner must become dissatisfied with their existing conception and find the new one to be intelligible, plausible, and fruitful.

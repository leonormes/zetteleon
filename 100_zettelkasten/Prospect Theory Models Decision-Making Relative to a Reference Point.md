Prospect Theory, from Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, is a descriptive model of how humans make choices under risk. It posits that people evaluate outcomes based on their potential value as gains or losses relative to a specific reference point (e.g., the status quo), rather than in absolute terms.

Its key features are:

- Reference Dependence: Outcomes are coded as gains and losses.
- Loss Aversion: Losses loom larger than equivalent gains.
- Diminishing Sensitivity: The marginal impact of both gains and losses decreases as they move further from the reference point.
  This theory contrasts with earlier utility theories that assumed rational actors.

**Habit 3: Put First Things First** is the principle of personal management. It is the physical creation, the day-in, day-out execution of the vision defined in [[Habit 2 - Begin with the End in Mind]]. While Habit 2 is about leadership (doing the right things), Habit 3 is about management (doing things right).

This habit moves beyond simple task lists and focuses on prioritizing based on importance rather than urgency. The core tool for this is [[The Time Management Matrix (Eisenhower Matrix)]].

Effective people stay out of Quadrants III and IV and spend most of their time in Quadrant II, focusing on high-leverage activities that are important but not yet urgent.

## ProdOS Integration

This habit is the engine of the [[03 - ProdOS (Productivity Operating System)]]. The entire system is designed to facilitate Quadrant II living.

- **The Weekly Review:** The [[10 - The Review and Reflection Process]] is the essential Quadrant II activity that allows you to plan the week ahead, ensuring you are scheduling your priorities.
- **Timeboxing & The Unschedule:** The techniques described in [[11 - Time Management (Timeboxing and The Unschedule)]] are direct implementations of Habit 3. You schedule the "big rocks" (important goals) first.
- **Engaging Actions:** The Four-Criteria Model (Context, Time, Energy, Priority) used to choose what to do, as described in [[04 - Atomic Actions and Next Actions]], is the moment-to-moment practice of putting first things first.

This habit is the bridge between your vision and your daily actions, leading towards the Public Victory, which begins with [[Habit 4 - Think Win-Win]].

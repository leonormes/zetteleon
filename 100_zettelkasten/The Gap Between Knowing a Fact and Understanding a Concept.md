title: The Gap Between Knowing a Fact and Understanding a Concept

There is a profound difference between *knowing a fact* and *understanding a concept*.

- Knowing a fact is possessing a piece of trivia that requires little mental effort (e.g., "Einstein was a genius").
- Understanding a concept involves building an internal mental model, connecting ideas, and grasping their implications (e.g., *why* the consequences of Special Relativity are so profound).

When you try to share the awe that comes from understanding, you are trying to share your entire mental model. Others, who may only know the fact, cannot see the intricate structure you have built. It is like trying to describe a colour to someone who cannot see it.

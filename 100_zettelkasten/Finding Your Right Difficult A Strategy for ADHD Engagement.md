For individuals with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a crucial strategy for maintaining consistent engagement and preventing the brain from getting stuck in negative rumination (the "Demon" of the [[The DMN as a "Demon" - Negative Rumination in ADHD|Default Mode Network]]) is to actively seek out and cultivate what is termed "Finding Your Right Difficult."

This concept emphasizes identifying challenges that are stimulating enough to engage one's creativity and strengths, providing a consistent source of intrinsic motivation. It's about finding tasks or activities that are neither too easy (leading to boredom and disengagement) nor too hard (leading to overwhelm and avoidance), but perfectly aligned with the ADHD brain's need for novelty, interest, and challenge.

When an individual is engaged in their "right difficult," their [[Hyperfixation and Neurotransmitter Flooding in ADHD|Task-Positive Network (TPN)]] is highly active, leading to periods of intense focus and vibrant thought. By intentionally building a life that regularly incorporates these kinds of stimulating challenges, individuals with ADHD can more effectively regulate their "thought battery" and lead a more consistently fulfilling and productive life.

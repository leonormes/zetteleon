## Individual ADHD Strategy Involves a Hybrid System and Self-Compassion

**Summary:** An effective personal strategy for a remote developer with ADHD involves seeking a formal diagnosis, building a hybrid system of tools and rituals, structuring their environment, and practicing self-compassion.

**Details:** After exploring medical treatment, the developer should construct a personalized system blending digital tools (task managers, focus aids) with analog habits (brain dumps, five-minute rule). Creating a dedicated workspace and a consistent daily routine is crucial for managing energy and focus. Finally, practicing self-compassion by acknowledging setbacks as normal and tracking achievements in a "wins journal" helps combat imposter syndrome.

When an individual with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experiences hyperfixation (often referred to as hyperfocus), it is typically accompanied by a significant engagement of the [[Task-Positive Network (TPN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) Defined|Task-Positive Network (TPN)]]. This intense, sustained concentration on a highly interesting or stimulating subject is fueled by a surge of neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine.

Dopamine, a key neurotransmitter for motivation, reward, and attention, floods the brain during hyperfixation. This neurochemical surge enhances motivation, makes tasks feel intensely rewarding, and can make every related thought seem vibrant, full of potential, and backed by a strong feeling. This state can temporarily override the "glitchy switch" between brain networks, allowing for exceptional focus and productivity.

This phenomenon highlights the interest-driven nature of the ADHD brain and its unique response to intrinsic motivation, contrasting with neurotypical motivation patterns.

**The Crash Phase:**

This intense dopamine flooding is not sustainable. Eventually, the novelty fades, dopamine reserves deplete, and the crash occurs. The same neurotransmitter flooding that enabled hyperfixation contributes to the subsequent burnout and dopamine deficit in the trough phase, completing the hyperfixation-burnout cycle.

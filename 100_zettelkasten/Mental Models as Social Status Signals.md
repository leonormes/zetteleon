Mental models are not just for individual navigation; they are a fundamental part of our social hierarchy and interaction. We use the perceived quality of others' mental models as a proxy for competence, which in turn confers social status.

Since a person's model is invisible, we judge it by its outputs: its **demonstrated competence**. An individual whose models consistently produce accurate predictions, effective solutions, or clear explanations is seen as intelligent, wise, or capable.

- An entrepreneur who builds a successful company is rewarded with status because we infer they have a superior model of the market.
- A scientist who publishes a groundbreaking theory gains prestige because their new model explains the world more accurately.

In this sense, a useful, accurate, and predictive mental model becomes a form of **social currency**. We are constantly engaged in a subconscious process of social calibration, comparing our own models to others in a "marketplace of ideas." We adopt useful models from those we admire and reject flawed models from others, reinforcing our own.

This social exchange is a key driver of [[Collective Intelligence is Enabled by Communication|collective intelligence]].

## Identity is Repeated Beingness

**Summary:** The word "identity" is derived from the Latin words *essentitas* (being) and *identidem* (repeatedly).

**Details:** This etymology reveals the core nature of identity: it is literally your "repeated beingness." Your identity is not what you think or say, but what you do repeatedly. It is the sum of your actions.

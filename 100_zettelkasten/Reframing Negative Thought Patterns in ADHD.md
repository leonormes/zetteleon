Individuals with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often experience a tendency to brood, ruminate, or get stuck in cycles of negative, self-critical thoughts. This can be linked to the brain's "Default Mode Network" (DMN), which, when overactive or dysregulated, can lead to persistent gloomy or self-blaming thought patterns.

Reframing these negative thought patterns is crucial for managing ADHD and improving mental well-being. The solution involves actively engaging the mind in constructive tasks to effectively "outsmart the Demon" of rumination. This means consciously shifting focus and energy towards activities that stimulate the brain's executive functions and reward pathways, thereby diverting the DMN from its negative loops.

Strategies include:

- **Engaging in novel or interesting tasks:** Leveraging the ADHD brain's interest-driven nature.
- **Breaking tasks into micro-actions:** Creating small, achievable wins that provide dopamine rewards.
- **Mindfulness and cognitive restructuring:** Learning to observe thoughts without judgment and challenging their validity.

By proactively engaging the mind, individuals can "jump tracks" from negative rumination to more productive and positive thought processes.

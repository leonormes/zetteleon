title: Productive Procrastination as an Avoidance Strategy

Productive procrastination is a form of avoidance where one engages in complex, interesting, and seemingly productive tasks—like endlessly refining a personal productivity system—as a way to put off more critical or difficult work. This behavior is especially common for those with ADHD, as it provides the novelty and engagement the brain craves, delivering a dopamine hit that core tasks may not.

While it feels like progress, it's a sophisticated form of procrastination. The activity itself is useful, but its timing and purpose are to avoid something else.

This is distinct from, but related to, the idea of using Complex Systems as Scaffolding for ADHD Executive Functions, which is a valid and intelligent approach to managing executive dysfunction. However, it's crucial to be aware of [[The Danger of Perpetual System-Building]], where the focus remains on creating the tool rather than using it to achieve results.

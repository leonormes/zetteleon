## Weekly Review Verifies Project Actionability and Context

**What:** A checklist for ensuring projects are actionable and well-organized during a weekly review.

**How:**
For every project, verify that it has:
1.  A clearly defined "done" state.
2.  At least one identified next action.
3.  Context tags on all actions.
4.  Appropriate starter tasks for difficult-to-initiate actions.

**Failure modes:**
- Skipping the review, leading to stale projects and forgotten actions.
- Not rigorously applying the criteria, resulting in vague or unactionable items.

## Memory Formation Involves Three Stages Encoding Consolidation and Retrieval

**Summary:** The journey of a memory involves three fundamental stages: encoding, consolidation, and retrieval.

**Details:**
1.  **Encoding:** The initial process of transforming sensory information into a mental representation that the brain can store.
2.  **Consolidation:** The process by which newly encoded, fragile memories are stabilized and strengthened for long-term storage.
3.  **Retrieval:** The process of accessing and reactivating stored information from memory when it is needed.

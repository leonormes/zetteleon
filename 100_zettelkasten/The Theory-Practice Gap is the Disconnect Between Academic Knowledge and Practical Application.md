## The Theory-Practice Gap is the Disconnect Between Academic Knowledge and Practical Application

**Summary:** The "theory-practice gap" describes the failure of academic or theoretical knowledge to transfer effectively to practical, real-world settings.

**Details:** This gap is commonly observed in fields like nursing and education, where students report that theoretical instruction does not adequately prepare them for clinical or classroom realities. Some scholars argue it is a myth, positing that the real gap is between explicit academic theories and the implicit, experiential theories that practitioners develop through their work. Closing the gap requires better integration of academic knowledge with lived experience and mentorship.

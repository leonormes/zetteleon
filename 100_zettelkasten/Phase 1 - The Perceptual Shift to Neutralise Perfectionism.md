title: Phase 1 - The Perceptual Shift to Neutralise Perfectionism

The first phase of the [[Three-Phase Protocol for Execution MOC]] is a mental reset designed to neutralize the perfectionism that leads to paralysis. It involves three key shifts in perception:

1. **Detach Self-Worth from Outcome:** Your value as a person is not tied to the success or failure of your work. A messy first draft or a failed attempt is just a problem to be solved, not a reflection of your character. This mindset is a direct application of the [[12 - Core Principles and Values|Practice Compassionate Self-Awareness]] principle.
2. **Diminish Permanence and Importance:** View every action and decision as a low-stakes **test** that can be adjusted later. Nothing is permanent. This removes the pressure of having to get it right the first time and helps dismantle the "Wall of Awful" described in [[ADHD and Productivity]].
3. **Embrace "Stupidity" (Intuition):** Actively shut down the over-analyzing inner critic. The goal is to work from instinct and intuition in the initial creative phase, rather than getting bogged down in rational thought, which can be a form of resistance.

This perceptual shift is the prerequisite for [[Phase 2 - Aggressive Initiation to Overcome Paralysis]], as it creates the psychological safety needed to start without fear.

Sometimes, even without explicit reasons, we might unconsciously grant more weight to the opinions of people we perceive as more confident, authoritative, or socially adept, even if they lack specific knowledge in the area being discussed.

The Lack of Shared Context: You mentioned that others "do not have any idea what I imagine." This is crucial. They are reacting to a tiny fraction of your elaborate internal schema. Their dismissal, which might feel casual or ill-informed to you, is based on the limited information they have. However, because you hold the full picture, their seemingly small critique can feel like it's invalidating the entire unseen structure.

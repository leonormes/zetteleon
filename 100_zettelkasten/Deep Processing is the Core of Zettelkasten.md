The core of interaction with a Zettelkasten is not mere collection, but deep processing. This is why paraphrasing_is_a_complex_cognitive_skill; it forces us to understand an idea well enough to rephrase it, as discussed in paraphrasing_put_another_way. This act of translation is where true learning occurs.

However, this deep work is not easy. It's tempting to fall for the [[collectors fallacy]], hoarding notes without engaging with them. The real work is in the thinking, which is why [[The Processing Is the Hard Part]]. Acknowledging this reality helps us understand that the [[Zettelkasten Ain't Easy]]; it requires effort.

title: Shared Biology and Mirror Neurons Enable Model Sharing

Our ability to share similar mental models, despite their private and subjective nature, is made possible by three key mechanisms working in concert:

1. **Shared Biological Foundation:** At the most basic level, all humans are running on remarkably similar biological hardware. Our brains and sensory systems have the same fundamental structures, ensuring that our raw materials for building models are consistent. This creates a common ground of experience.
2. **The Mirror Neuron System:** These remarkable brain cells fire both when you *perform* an action and when you *observe* someone else performing that same action. When you see someone smile, your mirror neurons for smiling fire, creating a low-level internal simulation of their action and its associated feeling. This is a form of direct, non-verbal empathy that helps us understand the intentions and emotional states of others.
3. **Symbolic Language:** Language is the ultimate tool for overcoming the privacy of our own minds. It works by packaging complex, private experiences into shared, abstract symbols (words). We agree that the word "sadness" represents a particular cluster of internal feelings, creating a public pointer to a private experience. This allows us to transmit incredibly complex mental models from one mind to another, enabling [[Collective Intelligence is Enabled by Communication]].

These mechanisms work together: our shared biology provides the common canvas, mirror neurons let us simulate each other's intentions, and language provides the symbolic toolkit to exchange the rich, emotionally-driven models that define our inner lives.

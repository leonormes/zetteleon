## The ADHD Brain Operates as an Interest-Based Nervous System

**Summary:** Unlike neurotypical importance-based motivation, ADHD cognition is primarily driven by:
- Personal interest
- Novel challenges
- Immediate novelty
- Pressing urgency

**Key Aspects:**
- Poor response to abstract importance
- Weak future reward motivation
- Requires immediate engagement triggers

**Effective Triggers (PINCH Model):**
1. **P**assion/Play
2. **I**nterest
3. **N**ovelty
4. **C**hallenge
5. **H**urry (Urgency)

These stimuli reliably activate dopamine pathways that importance-based triggers fail to engage.

**Neurobiology:**
Linked to dopamine dysregulation in reward pathways

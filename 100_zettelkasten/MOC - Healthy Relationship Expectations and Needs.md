## MOC - Healthy Relationship Expectations and Needs

> **Inclusion criteria:** Atomic only; must be evergreen or growing.

This map explores the foundations of a modern, balanced partnership, especially when navigating the complexities of family life. The central pillar of all of this is [[Reciprocity is the Central Pillar of a Healthy Partnership]]. In a healthy partnership, almost everything you can reasonably expect is also what your partner can reasonably expect from you.

### Foundations of a Fair & Cooperative Partnership

These are the mutual expectations that form the bedrock of a strong relationship.

#### 1. Mutual Respect

This is the baseline. It means valuing opinions, speaking kindly, and honouring boundaries, as detailed in [[Mutual Respect in a Partnership Involves Valuing Opinions Speaking Kindly and Honouring Boundaries]].

#### 2. Open & Honest Communication

You can fairly expect a partner who is willing to engage in [[Open Communication in a Partnership Requires Active Listening and Collaborative Problem-Solving]].

#### 3. Shared Responsibility

This is crucial, especially with children. It's not about a perfect 50/50 split, but a fair division of the total load, which includes [[Shared Responsibility in a Partnership Includes Physical Mental and Emotional Labor]]. This hidden load is often described as [[Emotional Labor is the Invisible Work of Managing a Household and Family]].

#### 4. Emotional Support & Connection

A partner should be a safe harbor, as described in [[Emotional Support in a Partnership Creates a Safe Harbor for Vulnerability]].

#### 5. Partnership & Teamwork

This is the feeling that you are "in it together," which is built on [[Teamwork in a Partnership is Built on Shared Goals Reliability and Mutual Appreciation]].

### Common Needs Expressed in a Partnership

While every individual is different, these are fundamental *human* needs that are often prioritized in the context of a long-term relationship.

1.  **The Need to Feel Respected & Admired:** This is often a core need, as explained in [[The Need to Feel Respected and Admired is a Core Human Need in a Partnership]].
2.  **The Need for Physical Intimacy & Affection:** This is a vital form of connection, detailed in [[The Need for Physical Intimacy and Affection is a Vital Form of Connection]].
3.  **The Need for Emotional Connection:** This is the need to feel known and accepted, as covered in [[The Need for Emotional Connection Fosters a Sense of Being Known and Accepted]].
4.  **The Need for Autonomy:** This is the need to maintain your own identity, which is explored in [[The Need for Autonomy Preserves Personal Identity Within a Partnership]]

### Financial Dynamics and Conflicts

#### Principles for Fair Finances

When there's an income disparity, a cooperative approach is to [[Finances in an Unequal-Income Partnership Should Be Treated as Shared Family Money|decouple earnings from an equal say]]. It is reasonable to expect that [[Partners Should Have Equal Say in Financial Decisions Regardless of Income]].

The line between healthy management and control is important. [[Respectful Budgeting is a Collaborative Process Focused on Shared Goals and Autonomy|Respectful budgeting]] is collaborative, whereas [[Controlling Financial Behavior is Unilateral and Removes a Partner's Agency|controlling behavior]] is unilateral. Similarly, [[Disrespectful Spending Violates Shared Agreements and Erodes Trust|disrespectful spending]] violates shared agreements. A practical approach to manage this is to use [[A Fair Financial System Uses a Shared Pot and Equal Personal Spending Money]].

#### Common Financial Conflict Points
- **Unilateral Spending:** When one partner makes large purchases without discussion, it is a sign of an [[Unilateral Spending on Major Purchases is a Sign of an Unhealthy Financial Dynamic|unhealthy dynamic]].
- **Double Standards:** Applying [[Financial Double Standards for Spending Undermine Fairness in a Relationship|different rules for spending]] undermines fairness.
- **Prioritizing Needs:** A [[A Healthy Family Balances the Needs of Children with the Needs of the Spousal Relationship|healthy family balances the needs of children and spouses]].
- **Lack of Agency:** A [[A True Discussion Requires That Both Partners Can Say No Without Fear|true discussion requires the ability to say "no"]]. When a partner's input is dismissed, it [[Dismissing a Partner's Needs as Inconvenient Signals a Lack of Empathy|signals a lack of empathy and respect]].

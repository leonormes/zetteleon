## MOC - The Relationship Between Habits and Identity

> **Inclusion criteria:** Atomic only; must be evergreen or growing.

This map explores the idea that the relationship between habits and identity is the deepest level of behavior change, asserting that [[True Behavior Change is Identity Change]]. This perspective shifts the focus from achieving external outcomes to defining and embodying the person one wishes to become.

### The Three Layers of Change

Change occurs across three interdependent layers. This model, described in [[Behavior Change Occurs on Three Layers Outcomes Process and Identity]], helps explain why some change efforts fail. While many people focus on outcome-based habits, the most effective approach is to begin with [[Identity-Based Habits Are More Sustainable Than Outcome-Based Habits|identity-based habits]].

### Identity as the Driving Force

The core reason for focusing on identity is that [[Behavior Incongruent with Self Will Not Last]]. To create lasting change, your actions must be aligned with your self-image. The ultimate goal is to reach a state where [[A Habit Becoming Part of Your Identity is the Ultimate Intrinsic Motivation|a habit becomes part of your identity]], shifting your mindset from wanting something to being someone (e.g., becoming a runner, not just running a marathon).

### Habits as Votes: Shaping Identity through Action

Your identity is not fixed; it is dynamic. In fact, [[Identity Emerges From Habits|identity emerges from your habits]]. The word itself, as explained in [[Identity is Repeated Beingness]], means "repeated beingness."

This process works by accumulating proof through action:

- **Proof through Action:** [[Every Action is a Vote for a Desired Identity|Every action you take is a vote]] for the person you want to become.
- **Accumulation of Evidence:** [[Small Habits Provide Evidence for a New Identity|Small, consistent habits are powerful]] because they provide the evidence that reinforces your desired identity.

The simplest path to changing who you are is a two-step process outlined in [[Identity Change is a Two-Step Process of Deciding and Proving]]: first decide, then prove it with small wins.

### Identity Conflict and Long-Term Trajectory

A significant barrier to change is [[Identity Conflict Can Impede Positive Habit Change|identity conflict]], where new habits clash with an established self-image. To progress, one must be willing to evolve their identity.

Ultimately, the real reason habits matter is that [[Habits Are the Channel Through Which You Shape Your Beliefs About Yourself|they are the channel for developing your deepest beliefs about yourself]]. Identity is the North Star that guides the entire process.

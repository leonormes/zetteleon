## Pragmatic Truth Focuses on Utility Over Absolute Correctness

**Summary:** Pragmatism treats truth as ideas that reliably help us predict, coordinate, and achieve aims in specific contexts rather than perfect mirrors of reality.

**Details:** Pragmatism treats truth as the property of ideas that reliably help us predict, coordinate, and achieve aims in specific contexts rather than as a perfect mirror of reality. An engineering model such as Newtonian mechanics is true enough to build bridges even if it is not the final word in physics. This orientation privileges testable consequences and revisability over certainty, enabling action under uncertainty. The practical criterion is whether the belief improves outcomes with acceptable risk and cost in this domain.

When a supposed atomic unit actually depends on the variable state of something else, it's not independent or isolated.

This makes it confusing.

## The Atomic Ideal

Individual parts should function on their own. This connects to mathematical concepts like [[Prime Numbers Are the Atomic Elements of All Numbers]] - primes are truly independent building blocks that don't depend on other numbers for their definition.

The atomic notes should be independent. They shouldn't only make sense when combined with other notes. Instead, when combined, they create something new. This relates to [[Paraphrasing Demonstrates the Independence of Meaning from Language]] - meaning should be independent of its specific expression.

## Necessary vs. Problematic Dependencies

When something is combined to create a bigger thing, that bigger thing is dependent on those atoms. This is a necessary dependency - like how [[Emergent Properties]] arise from component interactions.

But problematic dependencies occur when understanding requires external context. This connects to [[Human Understanding is Inherently Myopic]] - we struggle with systems where components can't be understood in isolation.

**Two types exist:**

1. **Implicit dependencies:** Foundational concepts assumed for understanding (unavoidable)
2. **Explicit dependencies:** When Note A is unintelligible without reading Note B (problematic)

The solution is **loose coupling**: notes understandable on their own yet meaningfully linked. See [[30_Library/200_projects/ProdOS/The Problem of False Atoms]] for comprehensive exploration.

## The Processing Challenge

Dependencies make it difficult to understand a thing. When I am looking at something, I want to have it understood. It is challenging to come to conclusions. Those conclusions are possibilities, not certainties.

This difficulty relates to [[The Processing Is the Hard Part]] - the cognitive work of understanding interdependent systems is much harder than processing independent units.

## Complex Systems Reality

But this is a defining property of complex systems. [[Emergence and the Absence of Teleology]] shows how complex behaviors arise from simple interactions. Maybe dependencies are a way to gain a little bit of control over complexity.

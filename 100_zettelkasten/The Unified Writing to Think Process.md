This process integrates four powerful philosophies into a single, comprehensive workflow for using writing as a tool for thinking, discovery, and reflection.

- **Annie Murphy Paul (*****The Extended Mind*****)**: Provides the methods for thinking *outside* the brain, using our bodies, spaces, and tools to generate novel insights.
- **Natalie Goldberg (*****Writing Down the Bones*****)**: Provides the method for accessing raw, energetic first thoughts and bypassing the internal critic.
- **William Zinsser (*****On Writing Well*** **&** ***Writing to Learn*****)**: Provides the craftsman's toolkit for refining raw thoughts into clear, strong prose and the philosophy for using writing to understand a subject.
- **Joe Moran (*****First You Write a Sentence*****)**: Provides the artist's perspective on crafting sentences with rhythm, care, and generosity.

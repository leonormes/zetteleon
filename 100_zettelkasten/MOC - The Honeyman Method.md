Hayley Honeyman's "Honeyman Method" for ADHD routines presents [[The Honeyman Method uses three-tiered routines to adapt to energy variation]]. Instead of aiming for a single "perfect" schedule, Honeyman recommends creating ideal, average ("most likely"), and minimum routines that adapt to fluctuating energy and motivation levels—a strategy shown to be effective for neurodivergent people.

### Core Idea: Flexible Routine Tiers

The method consists of three distinct tiers:

**Ideal Routine:** [[Ideal routines represent maximum energy and motivation days]]. Include all desired activities, even if they rarely happen all at once (e.g., walking the dog for an hour, cooking breakfast, journaling, and handling emails). This tier demonstrates what's possible under optimal conditions.

**Most Likely Routine:** [[Most Likely routines are scaled-down versions for average energy]]. Shorten or simplify tasks (e.g., shorter walk, easier breakfast, quicker grooming, skip journaling if needed). This middle tier represents your realistic baseline—the version you'll use most frequently.

**Minimum Routine:** [[Minimum routines are bare-bones essentials for low-energy days]]. This might be as basic as brushing teeth, microwaving breakfast, and minimal grooming (even staying in pajamas). The bar is set low enough that completion remains genuinely achievable during executive dysfunction periods.

### Practical Steps for Building ADHD-Friendly Routines

1. List all tasks for your "ideal" routine on a great day with maximum motivation.
2. Scale down to create your "most likely" version for average days. Make tasks quicker or optional.
3. [[Making minimums truly attainable addresses executive dysfunction]]. For some, even just eating breakfast is considered a win.
4. Accept energy variation as normal—don't judge yourself for needing minimum routines on hard days. [[Cultivating Self-Compassion for ADHD]] is essential for sustainable habit formation.
5. Use the same model for both morning and evening routines, tailoring the activities and thresholds for each time period.

### Actionable Example: Morning Routine Tiers

| Routine Tier | Example Activities |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Ideal** | 1hr dog walk, cooked breakfast, full grooming, journaling, emails |
| **Most Likely** | 20min walk, easy breakfast (toast), basic grooming, skip journaling, emails optional |
| **Minimum** | Quick dog let-out, cereal, stay in pajamas, minimal hygiene |

This table demonstrates how the same routine framework scales across three distinct capacity levels, maintaining structure while adjusting intensity.

### ADHD Strategy Principles Highlighted

The Honeyman Method exemplifies several crucial principles for neurodivergent productivity:

**Adaptive routines:** Building routines for multiple energy levels addresses common failures in consistency for ADHD. [[Multi-tier routine systems improve consistency and self-compassion]] by eliminating the all-or-nothing trap.

**Self-compassion:** Removing guilt for "minimum" days encourages sustainable habit-building. This approach directly supports [[Cultivating Self-Compassion for ADHD]] by normalizing variable capacity rather than pathologizing it.

**Immediate wins:** [[Making minimums truly attainable addresses executive dysfunction]]—feeding yourself can be the day's success. This recognizes that executive function impairment is real and requires accommodation, not willpower.

**Structure + flexibility:** [[Combining structure with flexibility satisfies neurodivergent dual needs]]. This satisfies the need for predictable anchors (autism) while providing freedom to adapt (ADHD).

### Implementation Action Items

The practical implementation follows a clear sequence:

1. Write out your "ideal" morning and evening routines step by step.
2. Create "most likely" and "minimum" versions beneath each ideal step.
3. [[Daily tier selection based on current energy improves routine consistency]]. Review each morning, choosing which tier fits your energy.
4. Accept and normalize switching between tiers as needed. The tier you choose is always the "right" choice for that day.

### Key Insight

[[Multi-tier routine systems improve consistency and self-compassion]] for ADHD and autistic individuals, supporting daily function without setting unrealistic expectations. The framework acknowledges that neurodivergent nervous systems operate with variable capacity—not as a flaw to overcome, but as a reality to accommodate intelligently.

By pre-planning all three tiers, you eliminate decision-making during low-energy periods while maintaining the routine structure that prevents complete habit collapse. This is sustainable productivity: working with your brain's patterns rather than demanding it conform to neurotypical expectations.

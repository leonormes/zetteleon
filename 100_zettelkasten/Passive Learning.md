Passive learning methods, such as reading or listening, can be less effective than active learning because they often lack the focused [[Attention in Learning]] required for deep processing. They frequently lead to only a superficial understanding of the material, a phenomenon influenced by our [[Perception in learning]]. This can be particularly true if one has a [[Predisposition to Passive Activities]].

The most effective way to counter this is through effortful retrieval, as [[Active Recall Strengthens Memory Through Retrieval Practice|active recall strengthens memory]].

Context: From "The Art of Active Learning"

It feeds directly into the [[Illusion of Explanatory Depth (IoED)]]

And I am hoping to mitigate it with [[Writing in Iterative Refinement]]

[[Type 1 vs Type 2 Information in Learning and Action]]

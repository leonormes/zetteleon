In the ADHD brain, the normal anticorrelation between the [[Task-Positive Network (TPN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) Defined|Task-Positive Network (TPN)]] and the [[Task-Positive Network (TPN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) Defined|Default Mode Network (DMN)]] can be dysregulated, often described as a "glitchy switch." This means that instead of one network cleanly activating while the other deactivates, there can be interference or an inability to smoothly transition between them.

This dysregulation manifests in two primary ways:

- **DMN Intrusion on TPN:** The DMN, responsible for internal thought and mind-wandering, can intrude upon the TPN's activity, showing excess activity during tasks when it should be suppressed. This leads to distraction, making it difficult to sustain focus on external tasks.
- **Getting Stuck in the DMN:** Conversely, individuals with ADHD can get "stuck" in the DMN, leading to prolonged periods of brooding, rumination, and negative self-critical thoughts, especially when there is no engaging external task to activate the TPN. This state can feel dull, empty, and contribute to emotional dysregulation.

This "glitchy switch" is a core neurobiological factor contributing to the fluctuating attention and thought intensity experienced by individuals with ADHD.

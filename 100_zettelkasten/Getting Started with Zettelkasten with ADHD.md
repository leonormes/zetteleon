To overcome the inertia of starting a Zettelkasten, especially with ADHD, the key is to allow for imperfection. The goal is not to build a perfect system, but to start thinking and connecting ideas, embracing the concept that [[Your Zettelkasten is a Mirror not a Monument]].

Here are some practical steps:

1. Start ridiculously simple: Write one note. Don't worry about structure, tags, or links. Just capture something interesting.
2. Create a "no research" rule: Give yourself permission to do it "wrong." The value is in the thinking, not perfect implementation.
3. Set a timer for 10 minutes: Write one note within that time. When the urge to research "the right way" hits, acknowledge it, but stay with your note.
4. Build incrementally: After a week of single notes, start adding one connection between notes per day.
5. Create a "parking lot" note: When you get the urge to optimize or research, jot the idea down in a separate note to explore later.

The Zettelkasten method worked for Luhmann because he developed it organically. Your ADHD brain is excellent at seeing connections between diverse topics. Trust that strength instead of fighting against how your mind works.

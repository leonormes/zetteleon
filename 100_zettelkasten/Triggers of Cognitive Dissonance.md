Cognitive dissonance is triggered by a conflict between cognitions. This can manifest in two primary ways:

1. **Conflicting Beliefs:** Holding two or more beliefs that are inconsistent with each other. For example, believing in the importance of environmental protection while also engaging in behaviors that harm the environment.
2. **Contradictory New Information:** Encountering new information that directly challenges a deeply held belief. For example, a person who believes they are a good driver being presented with evidence of their poor driving record.

This conflict leads to a state of [[Cognitive Dissonance]].

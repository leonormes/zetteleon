This collection of notes explores the psychological and cognitive reasons why a user might feel validated by the output of a Large Language Model (LLM), even while knowing the model does not possess genuine understanding.

The feeling of validation stems from several key factors:

- The LLM's ability to simulate intelligent conversation by [[LLMs mimic human conversational patterns]].
- The impression of deep analysis created by [[LLMs simulate expertise to generate validation]].
- Our inherent human tendencies, explored in [[Humans are primed to feel validated by conversational AI]].
- The phenomenon acting as an [[LLM validation is an informal Turing Test]].

Ultimately, the source of this experience is not in the machine, but in ourselves. The [[Meaning in an LLM interaction resides in the user's interpretation]], showing that we are using [[LLMs as tools for thought]].

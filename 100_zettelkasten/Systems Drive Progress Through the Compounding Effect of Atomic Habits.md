## Systems Drive Progress Through the Compounding Effect of Atomic Habits

**Summary:** Systems generate progress by breaking down large goals into small, repeatable "atomic habits" whose effects compound over time to produce significant results.

**Details:** Real, sustainable change is the result of continuous, small decisions. A system that facilitates a mere 1% improvement each day can lead to results that are nearly 37 times better over a year. This constant, daily improvement is the essence of progress. Even if individual changes are barely noticeable, their cumulative effect changes the long-term trajectory.

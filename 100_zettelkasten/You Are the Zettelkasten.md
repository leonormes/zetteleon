The core idea is that you are the Zettelkasten. The physical notes are nothing without the mind that engages with them. The thing of value exists in your head. This idea is captured in [[Zettelkasten System Essence]] and explored further in [[Zettelkasten in the Mind]].

The system is not a passive repository but an active thinking partner whose value is only realised through thought ([[Zettelkasten System Potentiality]]). This requires active mental work, because [[Cognitive Engagement Activates Zettelkasten]].

This engagement is crucial for several reasons:

1. [[Zettelkasten as a Tool to Overcome Cognitive Limits]]: It acts as an extension of our mind, helping us manage our cognitive limitations.
2. [[Deep Processing is the Core of Zettelkasten]]: The real work is not in collecting notes, but in the difficult-yet-essential task of processing and understanding them.
3. [[Your Zettelkasten is a Mirror not a Monument]]: The focus should be on the thinking process itself, not on building a perfect system.

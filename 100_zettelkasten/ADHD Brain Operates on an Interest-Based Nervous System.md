## ADHD Brain Operates on an Interest-Based Nervous System

**Summary:** The ADHD brain functions as an "interest-based nervous system," where motivation is regulated by intrinsic interest, novelty, or urgency rather than by perceived importance alone.

**Details:** This phenomenon is linked to dopamine dysregulation. It explains why a software developer with ADHD can enter a state of deep hyperfocus on a complex, engaging problem but struggle immensely to initiate routine, mundane, or ambiguous tasks like writing boilerplate code or answering emails. This creates a cycle of procrastination on necessary but uninteresting work, leading to stress and project delays.

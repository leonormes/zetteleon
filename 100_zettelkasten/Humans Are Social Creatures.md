At our core, we are wired for connection and belonging. Our ancestors' survival depended on being accepted by the group. This deep-seated need for acceptance means we are often highly attuned to the opinions and approval of others. External validation can feel like a signal of acceptance and belonging, while criticism can feel like a threat of rejection.

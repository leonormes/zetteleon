## Environmental and Physical Hacks for ADHD Focus

For the ADHD brain, focus is heavily influenced by the external environment. Instead of relying on internal willpower to fight distractions, it is more effective to proactively shape your surroundings to support attention.

### Core Strategies

1. **Change Work Environments for Novelty**: When focus wanes or you hit a mental wall, changing your physical location can be a powerful reset. The novelty of a new environment provides a dopamine boost that can restore focus.
    - *Examples*: Moving from a home office to a library, a coffee shop, or even just a different room in the house.

2. **Physically Remove Distractions**: The ADHD brain is highly susceptible to environmental cues. The mere presence of a distraction, like a phone, can create a significant attention barrier. Physically removing it from your line of sight is more effective than trying to ignore it.
    - *Example*: Gently tossing your phone onto a sofa or into another room when you need to focus.

### Why It Works for ADHD

- **Leverages Novelty for Dopamine**: Changing environments taps directly into the ADHD brain's craving for [[Novelty Seeking]] to generate focus.
- **Reduces Attentional Competition**: Removing distractions reduces the number of stimuli competing for your attention, freeing up cognitive resources for the primary task.
- **Lowers Activation Energy**: It is easier to change your environment than it is to force your brain to ignore a persistent distraction.

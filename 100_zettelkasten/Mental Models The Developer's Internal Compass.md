As developers interact with complex software systems, programming languages, and development tools, they construct internal representations, or mental models, to make sense of these entities. These models are not just passive knowledge structures; they are active, dynamic frameworks that developers use to understand system behavior, predict the consequences of their actions, debug problems, and design new solutions. The quality of these models depends on their correctness and consistency, highlighting why understanding the difference between [[Accuracy and Precision are Independent Concepts]] is crucial.

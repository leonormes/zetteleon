## Probabilistic Thinking is a Tool for Navigating Uncertainty

**Summary:** Probabilistic thinking is a mental model that involves treating beliefs not as absolute truths, but as hypotheses with varying levels of confidence.

**Details:** Instead of asking "Is this true?", one asks "How likely is this to be true?" This approach allows for action and decision-making in the face of uncertainty. Beliefs are assigned a confidence level (e.g., "I'm 70% confident this will work") and are continuously updated as new evidence becomes available, a process known as Bayesian updating. This fosters adaptability and reduces the psychological pressure to be absolutely right.

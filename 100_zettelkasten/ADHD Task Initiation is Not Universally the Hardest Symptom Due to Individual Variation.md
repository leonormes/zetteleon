While task initiation difficulty is a well-documented, neurobiologically-based symptom of ADHD, it is not universally the "hardest part" for all individuals. Research shows that ADHD is a heterogeneous condition with extreme individual variation in which symptoms cause the most impairment. Many individuals experience equal or greater difficulty with emotional regulation, working memory, or sustained attention.

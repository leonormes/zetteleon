Based on research across neuroscience and clinical psychology, task execution can be broken down into distinct phases, with specific brain activation patterns and impacts from ADHD at each stage.

## The Phases of Task Execution

Research identifies several overlapping models for breaking tasks into phases. The most comprehensive framework combines elements from multiple models:

1.  **Initiation/Activation Phase:** [[Task Initiation Involves Organizing and Generating Motivation|Getting started on a task]], which requires organizing materials, estimating time, and establishing priorities.
2.  **Encoding/Planning Phase:** [[The Task Encoding Phase Involves Formulating an Approach|Once initiated, the brain moves through perceptual encoding]] of task demands to formulate an approach.
3.  **Execution/Sustained Attention Phase:** [[The Task Execution Phase Requires Sustained Attention and Working Memory|This phase involves maintaining focus and working memory]] while actively performing the task.
4.  **Performance Monitoring Phase:** [[The Performance Monitoring Phase Involves Dynamically Adjusting Behavior|This involves dynamically adjusting attention and behavior]] to situational demands and monitoring performance.
5.  **Completion Phase:** [[The Task Completion Phase Involves Finishing and Checking Work|The final phase involves finishing the task]], checking work, and transitioning away from the activity.

## How Brain Activation Changes Across Phases

Different brain networks are active during each phase:

-   **Initiation:** [[Task Initiation Activates Medial Prefrontal Regions for Energization|Superior medial prefrontal regions activate to provide "energization"]].
-   **Sustained Attention:** [[Sustained Attention Relies on a Right-Lateralized Prefrontal-Parietal Network|A right-lateralized network including the prefrontal cortex and parietal areas is engaged]].
-   **Performance Monitoring:** [[Performance Monitoring is Generated in the Medial Frontal Cortex|The medial frontal cortex, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex, becomes active to detect errors]].

## How ADHD Affects Each Phase

ADHD disrupts all phases of task execution in specific ways:

1.  **Initiation Deficits:** [[ADHD Causes Task Initiation Deficits Due to Dopamine Hyposensitivity|Task initiation is difficult due to dopamine hyposensitivity]]. This can lead to [[ADHD Paralysis is the Inability to Start a Task Until it Becomes an Emergency|ADHD Paralysis]], where action is only possible when a task becomes an emergency.
2.  **Sustained Attention Deficits:** [[ADHD Causes Sustained Attention Deficits Requiring Higher Cortical Activation|Maintaining focus is a challenge]], requiring higher cortical activation to compensate for underlying deficits.
3.  **Performance Monitoring Deficits:** The brain's response to errors is impaired, as shown by [[ADHD is Associated with Reduced Error-Related Negativity (ERN) and Error Positivity (Pe)|reduced ERN and Pe signals]]. This points to a breakdown in both automatic ([[Error-Related Negativity (ERN) Reflects Rapid Internal Error Detection]]) and conscious error awareness.
4.  **Completion Deficits:** [[ADHD Causes Deficits in Completing Long-Term Projects|Finishing long-term projects is particularly challenging]] due to issues with planning and sustained motivation.

## The Neuroenergetic Picture

[[The Neuroenergetic Deficit Theory Posits Chronic Energy Insufficiency in ADHD Brains|The neuroenergetic deficit theory]] helps explain why all phases are affected, proposing that ADHD brains have a chronic insufficiency of the neural resources needed to generate and maintain effort.

The key takeaway is that ADHD isn't just about "starting"—it's a multi-phase executive function disorder affecting initiation, performance, self-monitoring, and completion.

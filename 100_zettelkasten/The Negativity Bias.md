## MOC - The Negativity Bias

This map explores the "Negativity Bias," a core cognitive bias, and its connections to related concepts and applications.

### Core Concept
- **[[Negativity Bias]]** - The foundational, context-free definition.

### Amplification in ADHD

The effects of the negativity bias can be significantly intensified by ADHD-related traits:

- **[[Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)]]** - Intensifies the impact of perceived criticism.
- **[[ADHD Emotional Reasoning]]** - Negativity bias feeds into emotional reasoning patterns.
- **[[The Shame-Procrastination Cycle]]** - Creates reinforcing cycles of shame and avoidance.

### Related Biases and Concepts
- **[[Loss Aversion Describes Asymmetric Pain of Loss vs Pleasure of Gain]]** - The economic equivalent; the pain of losing is stronger than the pleasure of gaining.
- **[[Emotional Reasoning]]** - The bias can trigger this, leading us to treat negative feelings as objective facts.
- **[[Common Cognitive Distortions]]** - Negativity bias is a root for many distortions.

### Social & Evolutionary Context
- **[[Humans Are Social Creatures]]** - Explains *why* this bias evolved; threat detection (including social rejection) was crucial for group survival.
- **[[Why External Validation is So Powerful]]** - Explains why negative external validation (criticism) feels more powerful than positive validation (praise).

### Effects & Consequences
- **[[The Emotional Cost of Being Wrong is Magnified by Loss Aversion]]**
- **[[Misinterpretation as Character Flaws]]** - Can lead to interpreting symptoms (like those of ADHD) as personal failings.
- **[[Why Others' Opinions Can Feel Undeservedly Powerful]]** - This is a direct consequence of the negativity bias in a social context.

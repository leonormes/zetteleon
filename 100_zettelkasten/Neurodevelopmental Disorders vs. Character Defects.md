A neurodevelopmental disorder, such as ADHD, is a matter of brain function and wiring. It is a medical condition and not a moral failing or a reflection of a person's character.

In contrast, a 'character defect' relates to the moral and ethical dimensions of a person's personality. It involves a consistent pattern of behavior that goes against virtuous ideals.

Understanding this distinction is crucial for compassion and accurate self-assessment. Attributing challenges from a neurodevelopmental disorder to a character defect is a fundamental misunderstanding that can lead to shame and stigma.

title: Chemotaxis as a Primitive Precursor to Emotion

While single-celled organisms do not have emotions, they possess a remarkably similar and ancient foundational mechanism for guiding action called **chemotaxis**. This process serves as a primitive precursor to the complex emotional systems in animals.

Emotion evolved as a highly efficient system to solve a fundamental problem: quickly assess whether something is good (a resource) or bad (a threat) and trigger the appropriate action (approach or avoid).

Chemotaxis in a bacterium follows the exact same logic:

1. **Sense:** Receptors on the cell's membrane detect the concentration of chemicals (e.g., nutrients or toxins) in the environment.
2. **Evaluate:** The cell's internal machinery computes whether it is moving towards a higher concentration of "good" chemicals or "bad" chemicals.
3. **Actuate:** Based on this evaluation, the cell adjusts the rotation of its flagellum (propeller) to either continue moving forward or to tumble randomly and change direction.

This purely biochemical sense-evaluate-actuate loop is the ancient, foundational logic upon which the far more complex, neurologically rich system of emotions was built over hundreds of millions of years of evolution. It is the most basic form of a system that links perception to survival-oriented action.

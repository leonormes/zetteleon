# The Pomodoro Technique Uses Short Timed Intervals to Maintain Focus

**Summary:** The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

**Details:** Each 25-minute work interval is called a "pomodoro." After four pomodoros, a longer break is taken. Each pomodoro is essentially a timebox dedicated to a single task. This method is lauded for improving focus by minimizing distractions and preventing burnout through regular breaks.

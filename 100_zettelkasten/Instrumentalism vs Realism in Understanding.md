This distinction from the philosophy of science describes two views on theories and models:

- Instrumentalism: Views a theory as merely a tool or instrument for making accurate predictions. Its value is purely functional; it does not claim to describe reality.
- Realism: Believes a theory aims to be a true description of the underlying reality. The goal is to understand the actual mechanics of a system.
  A person with a flawed but functional mental model is stuck in an instrumentalist phase. Their model is just a tool to get the right output. Progress requires moving towards a realist view, seeking to understand how the system truly works.

## Instrumentalism Vs Realism in Understanding

tags:

This describes a distinction in how one treats a model:

- **Instrumentalism**: Views a model purely as a tool for getting correct answers or predictions. The model's "truthfulness" about reality is irrelevant as long as it works.
- **Realism**: Believes the goal of a model is to be a true description of the underlying reality.

A person stuck with a flawed mental model is often in an instrumentalist phase. Their model of a Kubernetes Service as a "magic IP" is a tool that works for simple deployments. They haven't progressed to a realist understanding of how `kube-proxy` and `iptables` actually function.

Our conversation has been a journey from an instrumentalist view of numbers (they are tools for counting) to a more realist view (what *is* the structure of numbers? e.g., ).

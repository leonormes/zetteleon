Honesty is the virtue of telling the truth, being sincere, and acting in a way that is worthy of trust.

It involves more than just not lying. It is about presenting oneself authentically and living with integrity. An honest person's actions align with their words.

This quality is a cornerstone of building strong, trusting relationships, both personally and professionally.

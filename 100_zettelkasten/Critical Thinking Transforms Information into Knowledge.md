## Critical Thinking Transforms Information into Knowledge

**Summary:** The transformation of information into knowledge occurs through the active process of critical thinking, analysis, and synthesis.

**Details:** This involves critically evaluating information, analyzing the relationships between different pieces of data, and synthesizing them to form new insights or ideas. This analytical process turns raw, unstructured information into a more organized and meaningful form of understanding.

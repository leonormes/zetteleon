title: All the Enthusiasm and Energy for a Plan Disappears

My main problem with the ADHD is the way all the enthusiasm and energy for a plan disappears.

If I create some elaborate system with the enthusiasm needed to keep it going, that disappears and the system no longer works. Ideally, I need something that is so simple I don't have to remember anything.

[[Consistency and Momentum]]

[[Make It Stupidly Simple]]

[[Overwhelm]] - Overwhelm can cause enthusiasm for a plan to disappear.

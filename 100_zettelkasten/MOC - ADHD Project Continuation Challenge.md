## MOC - ADHD Project Continuation Challenge

> **Inclusion criteria:** Atomic strategies and concepts related to maintaining continuity on creative projects; must be evergreen or growing.

### The Core Problem

[[ADHD Causes Deficits in Completing Long-Term Projects]] rel:: describes-problem

The specific challenge: When actively creating, my thoughts are wrapped up in the work. The mental model feels strong, unique, and complete—I can feel the bigger picture, the hierarchy, the system as a whole. It feels right and enjoyable.

When I return after a break, my thoughts are no longer wrapped up in it. The mental model has dissipated. The project now feels too complex to re-enter, as I've forgotten the structure. The work has lost its novelty—by definition, it's not new anymore—and the ADHD brain craves newness.

This creates a destructive cycle: starting fresh feels easier than continuing, so big ideas never get off the ground. I keep having "revolutionary" new ideas and processes, abandoning previous work.

**Question:** How can I break this cycle?

### Strategies for Breaking the Cycle

#### Capture and Externalize the Mental Model

[[Documenting Mental Models Enables Project Re-entry]] rel:: solution strategy:: "Capture mental models while in flow"

- Create mind maps or flowcharts of ideas and connections
- Record voice memos explaining thought process and vision  
- Write quick notes about key elements and relationships
- **Why it works:** Externalizes what would be lost, creating scaffolding for reconstruction

#### Structure for Re-entry

[[Breaking Projects Into Micro-Tasks Reduces ADHD Overwhelm]] rel:: solution strategy:: "Decompose for clarity"

- Create lists of specific, actionable steps
- Set clear, achievable milestones
- Focus on one small task at a time
- **Why it works:** Makes the next action visible; each micro-task is a re-entry point

[[Continuation Rituals Bridge Work Sessions for ADHD]] rel:: solution strategy:: "Build continuity bridges"

- Summarize accomplishments at session end
- Note down next 1-3 concrete steps
- Briefly visualize where you'll pick up next
- **Why it works:** Externalizes mental model before it dissipates; primes for continuation

#### Create Environmental Support

[[Visual Schedules Make Routines Tangible]] rel:: solution strategy:: "Maintain visible context"

- Keep visual representations (sketches, diagrams, mind maps) visible in workspace
- Create project briefs outlining core concepts and goals
- Use sticky notes or whiteboards for key ideas
- **Why it works:** Visual cues help reignite connection to bigger picture

#### Leverage External Motivation

[[External Accountability Sustains ADHD Project Commitment]] rel:: solution strategy:: "Add social stakes"

- Share project goals with friend or mentor
- Join creative groups or find accountability partners
- Set up regular check-ins to discuss progress
- **Why it works:** Creates urgency and external structure; leverages social motivation

### Mindset Shifts

Rather than viewing each return as a fresh start, see it as an opportunity for **iteration and refinement**:

- Review previous work with fresh eyes
- Look for ways to build upon existing ideas
- Celebrate progress already made

The goal is finding balance between **innovation and completion**—allowing new ideas while maintaining commitment to seeing projects through.

**Definition:** Probability theory is the branch of mathematics that provides rigorous models for describing randomness, uncertainty, and the likelihood of events.

**Foundational Pattern:** Probability captures the pattern of apparent randomness found in complex systems and incomplete information.

**Mathematical Structure:** Probability applies the structure of quantity (specifically, measures and real numbers from 0 to 1) to sets of possible outcomes, creating a formal framework for calculating likelihoods.

**Axiomatic Foundation:** Modern probability is built on Kolmogorov's axioms, which define probability as a measure on a sample space satisfying specific properties (non-negativity, normalization, additivity).

**Applications:** Essential for modeling uncertainty in science, finance, machine learning, and decision-making under incomplete information.

## The Core Principles of Time Blocking Are Proactive Planning Single-Tasking and Visual Schedule Integration

**Summary:** The effectiveness of time blocking rests on three core principles: proactive planning, a single-tasking mindset, and integration with a visual schedule.

**Details:**
1.  **Proactive Planning:** Tasks are scheduled in advance, turning intentions into concrete plans.
2.  **Single-Tasking Mindset:** Each time block is dedicated to a single task or a batch of similar tasks, promoting deep focus.
3.  **Visual Schedule Integration:** A calendar (digital or physical) is used as the primary tool to allocate and visualize the time blocks.

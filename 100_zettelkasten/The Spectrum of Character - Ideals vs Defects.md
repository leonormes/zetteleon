Character can be understood as a spectrum where an ideal virtue represents one end and a defect or flaw represents the other. This framework helps in evaluating the moral and ethical dimensions of personality.

| Courage            | Bravery, Fortitude            | Cowardice, Timidity                |
| Compassion         | Empathy, Kindness, Generosity | Cruelty, Selfishness, Indifference |
| Responsibility     | Accountability, Dependability | Irresponsibility, Unreliability    |
| Humility           | Modesty, Teachability         | Arrogance, Egotism                 |
| Justice            | Fairness, Equity              | Prejudice, Unfairness              |
| Temperance         | Self-Control, Prudence        | Impulsiveness, Recklessness        |

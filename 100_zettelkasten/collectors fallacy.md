Grabbing content into my system is easy, so I do it and feel productive. But this is a lie. A cognitive trick.

## The ADHD Connection

This fallacy is particularly seductive for ADHD brains because:

- [[Dopamine-Seeking Behavior The Research Rabbit Hole]] - Information gathering provides immediate dopamine rewards
- [[Novelty Seeking]] - New content feels stimulating and interesting
- Collection feels like progress without the cognitive effort of actual processing

## Forms of Active Procrastination

The collector's fallacy manifests as various forms of productive-feeling avoidance:

- [[System Tweaking as a Form of Procrastination in ADHD]] - Organizing systems instead of using them
- [[Shiny Object Syndrome in ADHD]] - Abandoning systems for new ones
- [[The Core Problem Confusing Preparation with Action]] - Research and planning as substitutes for doing
- Information hoarding as described in [[Deep Processing is the Core of Zettelkasten]]

## The Real Work

[[The Processing Is the Hard Part]] - True value comes from engaging with ideas, not accumulating them

## Related Patterns

- [[Executive Function Challenges are Central to ADHD]] - Difficulty with sustained cognitive effort
- [[Part 1 The Psychology of ADHD-Driven Overthinking]] - Research as dopamine management strategy

**Summary:** Mathematical Platonism (or realism) is a philosophical view that mathematical objects—including numbers, sets, and geometric figures—exist independently of the human mind in an abstract, non-physical realm. Mathematicians are not inventors, but explorers discovering eternal truths.

**Core Thesis:** Mathematical entities are real and timeless. The statement "2+2=4" is an objective truth about the abstract objects '2' and '4', just as "the Earth is round" is a truth about a physical object. The "first principle" of Platonism is the discovery of transcendent truth in an abstract reality.

**Analogy:** A Platonist sees a mathematician like an astronomer peering through a telescope at a cosmos of ideas, charting its laws and geography. They **discover** pre-existing truths about these objects rather than **inventing** them.

**Example:** The number '7' is not just a symbol; it is the perfect, abstract form of "sevenness." This form has intrinsic properties, like being prime, that we can discover through logic. This means the [[Properties of Numbers are Inherent]].

**Challenge (The Access Problem):** How can we, as physical beings, access or have knowledge of this non-physical, acausal realm? This epistemological hurdle is a significant philosophical challenge to Platonism.

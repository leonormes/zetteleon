## Optimal Memory Function Requires Sleep, Stress Management and Mental Exercise

**Summary:** While memory techniques are powerful, their effectiveness depends on foundational brain health factors including quality sleep, stress management, and regular mental exercise.

**Key factors:**
- **Sleep**: Critical for memory consolidation; most memory formation occurs during sleep
- **Stress management**: Chronic stress impairs memory formation and recall
- **Mental exercise**: Regular challenging mental activity maintains neuroplasticity
- **Physical exercise**: Improves blood flow and neurogenesis in memory-related brain areas
- **Nutrition**: Certain nutrients support brain health and memory function

**Practical implications:**
- Memory techniques work best when combined with these supporting practices
- Neglecting these factors can undermine even the best memory strategies

## Proto-systems Are Informal Collective Routines That Organize Work

**Summary:** Proto-systems are the informal, often unwritten, collective routines, rituals, or cultural mechanisms that enabled groups to organize work and get things done long before formal productivity methods were codified.

**Details:** These foundational structures arise naturally in societies and communities to balance individual effort with group expectations. Examples include seasonal agricultural routines, religious ceremonies that structure time, military drills, and apprenticeship models. They are the ancestral scaffolding of productivity.

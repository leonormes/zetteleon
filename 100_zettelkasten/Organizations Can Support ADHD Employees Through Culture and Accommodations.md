## Organizations Can Support ADHD Employees Through Culture and Accommodations

**Summary:** Organizations can unlock the potential of neurodiverse talent by fostering a culture of psychological safety and providing structured, flexible accommodations for employees with ADHD.

**Details:** Key strategies include normalizing discussions around neurodiversity, shifting to outcome-based performance evaluations instead of tracking hours, and training managers to provide empathetic and effective feedback. Proactively offering accommodations like flexible deadlines, asynchronous communication options, and access to collaborative programming tools can create an inclusive environment where developers with ADHD can thrive.

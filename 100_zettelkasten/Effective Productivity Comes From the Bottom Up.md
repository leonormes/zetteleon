## Effective Productivity Comes From the Bottom Up

**Summary:** Effective productivity is built from the "bottom up," starting with the most mundane, ground-floor level of current activity and commitments.

**Details:** This principle emphasizes that while high-level goals and projects are important, true progress is made by consistently executing well-defined atomic actions. These small, foundational steps are the bedrock upon which larger achievements are built.

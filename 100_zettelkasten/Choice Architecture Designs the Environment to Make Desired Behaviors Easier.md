## Choice Architecture Designs the Environment to Make Desired Behaviors Easier

**Summary:** Choice architecture is the practice of designing the environment in which people make decisions to "nudge" them toward certain behaviors without restricting their freedom of choice.

**Details:** This strategy recognizes that context often determines behavior more than intention. Techniques include setting beneficial defaults (e.g., opt-out organ donation), increasing the visibility and accessibility of desired options (e.g., placing water at eye-level), and adding friction to undesirable options. It is a powerful way to bridge the intention-action gap by making good choices the path of least resistance.

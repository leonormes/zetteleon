**Summary:** True behavior change is identity change. This principle asserts that lasting behavioral transformation occurs not by focusing on external outcomes or even processes, but by fundamentally shifting one's beliefs, worldview, and self-image—who one believes oneself to be.

**The Core Insight:**

Most people approach behavior change by focusing on what they want to achieve (outcomes) or what they need to do (processes). However, the deepest and most sustainable change happens at the identity level—by changing what you believe about yourself.

**Why Identity Matters:**

The key problem many people face when trying to build lasting habits is that they focus on *outcome-based habits* (what they want to achieve) instead of starting with *identity-based habits* (who they wish to become). When behavior is incongruent with self-concept, it will not last.

**The Shift:**

Instead of:

- "I want to lose 20 pounds" (outcome)
- "I will run three times a week" (process)

Start with:

- "I am a healthy person" (identity)
- "I am an athlete" (identity)

When your behavior and identity are fully aligned, you are no longer forcing change; you are simply acting like the person you already believe yourself to be.

**Implications:**

This perspective fundamentally shifts the focus from achieving external outcomes to defining and embodying the person one wishes to become. It places identity at the foundation of The Fundamentals of behavior change.

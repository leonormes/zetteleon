title: How SI Base Units Are Interconnected

The [[The 2019 SI Redefinition is Based on Fundamental Constants|2019 redefinition of the SI]] established that the base units are not independent of one another. They form a single, coherent system linked through the fundamental constants of nature.

## How They Are Used and Linked in Science

The definitions explicitly depend on each other.

- Kilogram (kg): The kilogram is defined by the Planck constant (h), which has units of $J \cdot$ s, or $kg \cdot m^2 \cdot s^{-1}$. Therefore, to define mass, you must first have a definition for the metre and the second.
- Kelvin (K): The kelvin is defined by the Boltzmann constant (k), whose units are $J \cdot K^{-1}$, or $kg \cdot m^2 \cdot s^{-2} \cdot K^{-1}$. The definition of temperature is therefore built upon our definitions of mass, length, and time.
  This interconnectedness is a profound feature of the modern SI, reflecting the unified nature of physical laws.

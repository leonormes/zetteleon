## Originality is the Unique Synthesis of Existing Ideas

**Summary:** True originality is not the creation of ideas from nothing (creatio ex nihilo), but the unique and personal synthesis of existing ideas, experiences, and values.

**Details:** All ideas are built from existing conceptual building blocks, just as all DNA is built from the same four base pairs. An individual's originality lies in the specific way they combine, filter, and arrange these influences. Your unique perspective, shaped by your specific life experiences, is what makes your synthesis of ideas original, even if the components are not.

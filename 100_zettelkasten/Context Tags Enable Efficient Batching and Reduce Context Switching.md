## Context Tags Enable Efficient Batching and Reduce Context Switching

**Summary:** Context tags provide an organizational layer for actions that enables efficient batching of similar tasks, reduces context switching costs, and allows for filtering to show only currently doable actions.

**Details:** By categorizing actions based on required tools, locations, or people, individuals can group similar tasks together (e.g., all `@email` tasks) and complete them in one session. This minimizes the mental effort of switching between different types of work and helps focus on what is feasible in the current environment.

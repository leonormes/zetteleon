title: Reframing Language from Obligation to Purpose Boosts ADHD Task Initiation
type: concept

Reframing the language used to describe tasks can significantly improve task initiation for individuals with ADHD. This involves shifting from phrases of obligation, such as "I need to do this," to phrases that connect the task to personal meaning and purpose, such as "Why do I want to do this?"

By attaching a personal reason to a task (e.g., helping a family member, relieving a burden on others), it is possible to generate intrinsic motivation and reduce the resistance often associated with task initiation.

**Philosophical Basis:**
Aligns with [[Existentialism - Existence Precedes Essence]] - framing tasks as chosen expressions of purpose rather than imposed obligations

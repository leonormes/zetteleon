## Immutability Principle - Preserve Original Notes

**Summary:** In classic Zettelkasten, when understanding changes or new information contradicts an old note, create a new note documenting the contradiction and link back to the original rather than revising it.

**Details:** The immutability principle holds that once a main note captures an idea, its core content should remain as originally written. When your understanding evolves, you don't delete or substantially revise the old note—instead, you create a new note expressing the updated perspective and establish links showing the relationship (contradiction, refinement, evolution). This approach serves multiple purposes: it preserves your thinking history, showing how understanding developed over time; it allows contradictory or "unclarified" ideas to coexist, letting the network determine their value through connections; and it prevents premature convergence on a single "correct" view. The system is designed to tolerate ambiguity and contradiction. Value emerges from the network of links and back-references, not from maintaining perfectly polished individual notes. This principle embodies intellectual honesty—acknowledging that understanding is provisional and ideas often contradict before they clarify. The network becomes a record of genuine intellectual evolution rather than a sanitized final product.

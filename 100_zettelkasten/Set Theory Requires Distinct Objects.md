The idea that distinction is necessary for numbers is not just philosophical; it is embedded in the formal foundations of modern mathematics.

**Set theory**, a foundational system for mathematics, is based on the concept of a **set** as a collection of *distinct* objects. The very first axiom assumes that we have objects that can be told apart from one another.

This formalises the intuition that [[Discreteness as a Precondition for Counting]] is the starting point from which we build the entire structure of numbers.

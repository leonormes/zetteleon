## Shared Responsibility in a Partnership Includes Physical Mental and Emotional Labor

**Summary:** Shared responsibility in a partnership extends beyond a 50/50 split of physical tasks to include the fair and agreed-upon division of the total household load, including mental and emotional labor.

**Details:** While physical labor involves chores and childcare, the mental and emotional load is the often-hidden work of planning, scheduling, and managing the family's life. A cooperative partnership requires that both partners take initiative in all these areas.

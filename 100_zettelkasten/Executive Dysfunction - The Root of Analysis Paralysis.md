title: Executive Dysfunction - The Root of Analysis Paralysis

Executive dysfunction affects up to 90% of individuals with ADHD and is the primary driver of overthinking-procrastination cycles. In technical work, this manifests as:

Working Memory Overload: Your brain struggles to hold multiple pieces of information simultaneously. When designing cloud architecture, you might lose track of security requirements while focusing on performance optimization, leading to endless mental loops trying to remember and integrate all requirements.

Poor Impulse Control: You jump between ideas without completing thoughts. One minute you're researching Kubernetes configurations, the next you're down a rabbit hole about container orchestration alternatives, never actually implementing anything.

Cognitive Inflexibility: Once you start analyzing a problem one way, it becomes difficult to shift perspective. You might spend hours perfecting one approach to database scaling while missing simpler solutions.

**Definition:** Calculus is the branch of mathematics that studies continuous change, providing tools to analyze how quantities vary smoothly with respect to one another.

**Foundational Pattern:** Calculus captures the pattern of continuous change—how things move, grow, and vary smoothly over time or space.

**Core Operations:**
- **Differentiation:** Finding instantaneous rates of change (slopes, velocities)
- **Integration:** Accumulating quantities over intervals (areas, total distances)

**Synthesis of Structures:** Calculus combines the algebraic structure of numbers (quantity) with the geometric structure of space, all under the notion of a limit—the foundation for handling infinite processes rigorously.

**Applications:** Essential for physics (motion), engineering (optimization), economics (marginal analysis), and any field involving rates of change.

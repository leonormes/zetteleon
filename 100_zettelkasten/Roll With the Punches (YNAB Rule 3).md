"Roll With the Punches" is the YNAB rule for managing change and overspending. It acknowledges that no budget is perfect and that adaptation is a sign of successful engagement, not failure.

When overspending occurs in a category, this rule dictates that you must immediately move money from a lower-priority category to cover the deficit. This action enforces a conscious trade-off, making the true cost of the overspending visible. It provides the necessary flexibility for a budget to work in the real world, preventing the guilt and abandonment that comes with rigid, unrealistic plans.

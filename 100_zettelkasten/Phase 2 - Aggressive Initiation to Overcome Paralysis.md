After the [[Phase 1 - The Perceptual Shift to Neutralise Perfectionism]], the second phase of the [[Three-Phase Protocol for Execution MOC]] is to generate momentum through immediate, aggressive action. This phase is designed to bypass the common perfectionist trap of endless preparation.

1. **Start Before You’re Ready:** The primary enemy is Resistance, which manifests as excuses and the desire to prepare endlessly. The cure is to act immediately. This is a direct, forceful application of the "Motion Creates Motivation" principle from the [[ADHD and Productivity]] framework.
2. **Outline and Research Sparingly:** Treat research as a potential form of Resistance. The goal is to achieve **75% readiness**, not 100%. Condense the project to its core structure quickly and then begin execution.
3. **Prioritize Momentum over Quality (in the First Draft):** The goal of the initial phase is to get to "THE END" as quickly as possible. This requires separating the act of creation from the act of evaluation. Do not reflect or edit during the first pass. This aligns with the [[02 - GTD (Getting Things Done)]] principle of separating the **Clarify/Organize** stages from the **Engage** stage. The initial push is about creating a `v0.1` to work with, which can be as simple as a single [[04 - Atomic Actions and Next Actions|@starter_task]].

This aggressive start provides the raw material needed for [[Phase 3 - Compartmentalized Focus to Beat Distraction]].

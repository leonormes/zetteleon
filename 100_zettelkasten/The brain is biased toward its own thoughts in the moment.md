## The Brain is Biased toward Its Own Thoughts in the Moment

**Summary:** Human cognition exhibits a systematic bias that privileges our own thoughts as they occur, experiencing them from the inside with all their emotional and phenomenological texture, which creates an inflated sense of their importance or validity.

**Details:**

We experience our own thoughts with an inherent bias because:

- We encounter them from a first-person, immersed perspective
- They are accompanied by rich phenomenological qualities
- They feel immediate, alive, and personally significant
- We lack the automatic critical distance we apply to others' ideas
- The emotional and associative context amplifies their felt importance

This bias means:

- Our thoughts feel more insightful than an equivalent thought from someone else
- We overestimate the novelty or profundity of our own thinking
- We fail to notice gaps in logic that would be obvious in external text
- The subjective experience of thinking conflates with the quality of the thought

This is distinct from other cognitive biases like the Dunning-Kruger effect, though related. The bias operates at the moment of thought generation, before any metacognitive evaluation occurs.

The bias is functional—it motivates us to generate and explore ideas—but it requires compensating mechanisms (like writing) to enable objective evaluation.

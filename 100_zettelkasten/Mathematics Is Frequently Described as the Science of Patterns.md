**Summary:** Mathematics is the science of patterns, defined as the study of structure, order, and regularity in all its forms. This represents a modern synthesis that unifies diverse mathematical activities under a single principle.

**Details:** This modern definition reframes mathematics from the simple study of numbers to a broader exploration of patterns, whether they are real or imagined, visual or mental. The ultimate power of mathematics is its ability to reveal underlying structures, abstract them from their physical context, and make the invisible patterns of the universe visible and comprehensible.

**Modern Synthesis:** While each philosophical school (Logicism, Platonism, Formalism, Intuitionism) offers crucial insights, the most encompassing and practically useful "high principle" for modern mathematics is the science of patterns and structure. This principle is powerful because it abstracts the core activity of all mathematicians: they identify, abstract, analyse, and generalise patterns—whether patterns in number, space, logic, or even in other patterns.

**Unifying Framework:** This view provides a unifying framework that explains both the internal coherence and the external applicability of mathematics without demanding commitment to a Platonic realm or reducing everything to a formal game. It defines mathematics by what mathematicians do.

**Support:** This view is supported by mathematicians like G. H. Hardy and Keith Devlin.

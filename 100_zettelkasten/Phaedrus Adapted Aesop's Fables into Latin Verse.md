Phaedrus, a Roman poet of the 1st century CE, played a crucial role in the evolution of the fable by translating Aesop's oral tales into Latin verse.

This was a significant shift from oral to literary tradition. By composing the fables as poetry, Phaedrus elevated their status from simple folk tales to a recognized literary genre within the Roman world. His work was instrumental in preserving the Aesopic tradition and transmitting it through written culture, allowing the fables to be studied and read by educated audiences.

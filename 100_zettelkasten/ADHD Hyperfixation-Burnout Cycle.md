**Summary:** The ADHD hyperfixation-burnout cycle is a recurring pattern where individuals with ADHD experience intense, all-consuming engagement with a new interest followed by a sudden crash into complete disinterest and mental fog. This cycle is neurological in origin, driven by the ADHD brain's unique dopamine regulation system.

**Details:**

This pattern consists of four distinct phases:

1. **The Spark** - Initial dopamine-rewarding discovery of new interest
2. **Hyperfixation** - Intense, effortless concentration and all-consuming engagement
3. **The Crash** - Sudden loss of interest as novelty fades and dopamine rewards diminish
4. **The Trough** - Period of mental fog, apathy, and under-stimulation

**Why It Happens:**

The cycle is not a personal failing but the brain's powerful, albeit erratic, search for stimulation and reward. The ADHD brain has different dopamine regulation, causing it to seek intense novelty and stimulation. Once novelty fades or the most exciting aspects are explored, the dopamine reward system disengages, leading to the crash.

**Impact:**

This cycle is particularly frustrating because it sabotages long-term projects, systems, and goals. What felt like a "life-changing" passion during hyperfixation becomes "vague and empty" after the crash, leaving behind half-finished projects and abandoned systems.

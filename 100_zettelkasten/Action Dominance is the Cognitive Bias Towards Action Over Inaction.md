# Action Dominance is the Cognitive Bias Towards Action Over Inaction

**Summary:** Psychological research reveals an "action dominance" phenomenon, where people naturally focus more attention on actions than on inactions.

**Details:** Actions tend to elicit stronger emotional reactions, trigger higher regret, and are perceived as more consequential than failures to act. This bias is so strong that people may prefer to self-administer electric shocks rather than remain idle. However, this bias can lead to systematic errors when multiple demands compete for attention, as the salience of action targets creates cognitive load and interference.

## Music as a Product is Born From a Market-Driven Goal

**Summary:** Music created as a product often originates from a market-driven goal rather than a personal need for expression.

**Details:** The starting point for commercial music is frequently a business objective, such as "we need a summer hit," "this artist needs a song for a TikTok trend," or an analysis of what song structure is most popular on streaming playlists. The primary goal is to successfully penetrate a target market.

Type 1 information is knowledge acquired through passive consumption - reading, watching, planning, and theoretical study. It includes books, tutorials, documentation, and conceptual frameworks that provide understanding without direct experience.

This information is essential as a foundation for action, offering mental models and frameworks for understanding complex domains. However, it remains abstract until tested against reality through [[Type 2 Information is Experiential|experiential feedback]].

Examples include:

- Reading business books
- Watching coding tutorials
- Studying theoretical frameworks
- Creating detailed plans
- Researching methodologies

Type 1 information becomes problematic when it substitutes for action rather than preparing for it, leading to [[Information Addiction in Overthinkers|addictive consumption patterns]] that create an illusion of progress.

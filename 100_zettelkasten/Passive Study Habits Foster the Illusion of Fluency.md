## Passive Study Habits Foster the Illusion of Fluency

**Summary:** Common passive study habits, such as rereading texts and highlighting key passages, inadvertently foster the "Illusion of Fluency."

**Details:** These activities create a sense of familiarity with the material that does not translate into durable memory or the ability to recall information without cues. They increase processing fluency without ensuring deep encoding, leading learners to mistakenly believe they have mastered the content. Mistaking recognition for recall is another common pitfall.

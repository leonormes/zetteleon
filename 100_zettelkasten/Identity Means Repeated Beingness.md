**Summary:** The word "identity" is derived from Latin words meaning "being" (essentitas) and "repeatedly" (identidem), literally translating to "repeated beingness." This etymology reveals that identity is fundamentally about who you repeatedly are, not who you occasionally are.

**Etymology:**

- **Essentitas** (Latin): "being" or "essence"
- **Identidem** (Latin): "repeatedly" or "over and over"
- **Identity**: "Repeated beingness"

**The Implication:**

This linguistic origin illuminates a profound truth: you are what you repeatedly do. Your identity isn't determined by your one-time actions, grand declarations, or occasional behaviors—it's determined by your consistent, repeated behaviors.

**What This Means for Habits:**

- A single workout doesn't make you an athlete; working out repeatedly does
- Writing once doesn't make you a writer; writing repeatedly does
- One act of kindness doesn't make you a kind person; repeated kindness does

**The Accumulation Principle:**

Identity is literally built through repetition. Each repeated action adds evidence to the claim "this is who I am." The etymology itself encodes the mechanism of identity formation: repeat a behavior enough times, and it becomes part of your being.

**Strategic Insight:**

Understanding that identity means "repeated beingness" shifts focus from the question "Who am I?" to "What do I repeatedly do?" This makes identity something concrete and actionable rather than abstract and fixed.

**Frequency Matters:**

It's not about perfection or never missing. It's about what you do repeatedly—the dominant patterns of behavior. Your identity is the aggregate of your habitual actions, not your exceptional ones.

Writing and thinking are the same activity. Writing is not just a method for presenting what you already know, but the primary tool for discovering it.

## The Core Principle

Zinsser realized he often clarified subjects for himself "by just putting one sentence after another—by reasoning my way in sequential steps to its meaning."

## Why Writing Enables Thinking

- Forces clarity: Putting ideas into sentences exposes gaps in logic
- Creates connections: The act of linking thoughts reveals new relationships
- Provides objectivity: Written thoughts can be examined with distance
- Enables revision: Ideas can be reworked and refined

## The Physical Nature

Writing is a physical activity that "compels us by the repeated effort of language to go after those thoughts and to organize them and present them clearly."

The benefit of higher abstraction levels in improving understanding can be effectively compared to climbing a hill. Just as ascending a hill provides a wider, more encompassing view of the landscape below by reducing the detail of individual objects, so too does abstraction offer a broader perspective by distilling complex information. This is a primary method for overcoming our natural [[Human Understanding is Inherently Myopic|myopic understanding]].

## Extending the Idea

- The Purpose of the Climb: The ultimate benefit of this broader perspective is not just seeing more, but understanding more. A higher vantage point reveals the connections between disparate elements, which is how a [[Broader Understanding Enhances Predictive & Causal Insight]].
- Abstraction as Creation: This metaphor isn't limited to passive observation. In some domains, like mathematics, abstraction is an act of creation. It's not just climbing a hill to see a landscape, but engaging in the [[Generative maths is the creative discovery of abstract patterns]] that form new landscapes of thought.
- A Productive Counter-Argument: While climbing the hill provides breadth, innovation can also come from digging a deep well. A [[Deep Focus on a Single Concept Sparks Innovation]] by ignoring the broader landscape to uncover something entirely new, creating a healthy tension between breadthand depth-focused learning.
- The Philosophical Foundation: We are forced to climb because our default state is to be lost in the details of the valley floor. [[Human Understanding is Inherently Myopic]], and abstraction is the deliberate, effortful act of transcending this limitation.

title: Self-focus exists on a spectrum rather than as a fixed point

The concept of "normal" self-focus does not exist as a single fixed point or measurable standard. Instead, self-focus operates on a spectrum, varying between individuals and across different contexts. Most people naturally prioritize their own needs, thoughts, and problems to varying degrees, which is both healthy and necessary for survival and well-being. What differs among individuals is the degree of self-focus and the specific contexts in which it manifests.

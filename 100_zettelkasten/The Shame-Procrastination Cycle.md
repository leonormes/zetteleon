The Shame-Procrastination Cycle is a well-documented neurobiological pattern, particularly common in people with ADHD, where executive functioning challenges and emotional responses create a self-reinforcing feedback loop:

1. Executive functioning challenges make it difficult to initiate tasks, maintain focus, and complete work consistently
2. Shame develops from repeated experiences of not meeting expectations (your own or others')
3. Anticipatory anxiety grows about potential failure
4. Procrastination increases as a way to avoid the negative emotions associated with tasks
5. Performance suffers, reinforcing feelings of incompetence
6. The cycle deepens over time

**This isn't a character flaw or moral failing - it's a neurobiological pattern** that stems from differences in brain function, particularly related to:

- Executive function deficits
- Dopamine dysregulation
- Emotional regulation challenges

## Breaking the Cycle

Understanding that this is a neurological pattern, not a moral failing, is the first step toward interruption. Strategies include:

- [[Cultivating Self-Compassion for ADHD]]
- [[Reframe Habit Setbacks as Capacity Limits Not Character Flaws]]
- [[Breaking Projects Into Micro-Tasks Reduces ADHD Overwhelm]]
- External accountability structures ([[Body Doubling is an Effective ADHD Strategy]])

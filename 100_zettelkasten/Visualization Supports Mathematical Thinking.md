**Summary:** Mathematicians leverage visualization—using mental imagery, diagrams, and graphs—to internalize, identify, compare, connect, and share mathematical ideas and problems.

**What:** Visualization is the strategic use of visual and spatial reasoning to aid mathematical understanding and discovery.

**How:**

- Create diagrams to represent abstract relationships
- Use geometric intuition to guide algebraic reasoning
- Draw graphs to reveal patterns in data or functions
- Construct mental models of mathematical objects
- Employ visual metaphors for abstract concepts

**Cognitive Basis:**

Approximately 30% of the human brain is devoted to visual processing, making visualization a powerful tool for understanding. Visual representations can make abstract relationships concrete and accessible.

**Limitations and Pitfalls:**

- Visual intuition can mislead in higher dimensions or non-Euclidean spaces
- Diagrams may suggest patterns that don't generalize
- Rigorous proof remains necessary even when visualization suggests truth
- Some mathematical objects resist visualization entirely

**Best Practice:** Use visualization as a discovery tool and intuition guide, but always verify insights with rigorous proof.

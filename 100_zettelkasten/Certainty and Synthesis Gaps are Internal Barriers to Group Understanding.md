## Certainty and Synthesis Gaps Are Internal Barriers to Group Understanding

**Summary:** Even when knowledge exists within a team, two internal gaps can prevent it from being used effectively: the Certainty Gap (bias) and the Synthesis Gap (poor communication).

**Details:**

-   **The Certainty Gap:** This is the gap between a team's *perceived* understanding and their *actual* collective knowledge. It is a measure of overconfidence, often driven by cognitive biases like the Dunning-Kruger effect or groupthink.
-   **The Synthesis Gap:** This is the gap between a team's total *potential* knowledge and the knowledge they actually manage to synthesize and use. This gap is created by process losses, such as inefficient communication, poor documentation, or a failure to integrate diverse perspectives.

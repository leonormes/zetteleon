## Type 1 Information is Passive and Theoretical

**Summary:** Type 1 information is knowledge gathered through passive consumption or abstract planning, without direct interaction with the core problem.

**Details:** This category includes activities like reading documentation, watching tutorials, attending lectures, and creating detailed plans. For a brain avoiding the perceived risk of failure, Type 1 information feels safe and productive. However, it provides no real-world feedback and often becomes a sophisticated form of productive procrastination, fueling "analysis paralysis" by creating an illusion of progress. Its dopamine payoff is very low and delayed.

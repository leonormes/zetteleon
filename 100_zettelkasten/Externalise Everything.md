Your mind is designed for having ideas, not for holding them. Any thought, idea, or commitment that is on your mind should be captured in a trusted external system. This frees your brain to focus on thinking and creativity, rather than remembering.

## Theoretical Foundation

- [[The Extended Mind Thesis]] - Cognitive processes extend beyond our skulls to include external tools
- [[Zettelkasten the Extended Mind]] - Practical application where the system becomes part of thinking itself

## Cognitive Benefits

- [[Memory in learning]] — `addresses-limitation` — Externalisation compensates for WM bottleneck and limited capacity
- [[Working Memory Limitations in ADHD]] - External systems compensate for limited working memory capacity
- [[A Digital System Can Externalise and Organise Thoughts]] - Helps capture ideas that would otherwise be lost to scattered thinking
- [[Writing Creates Cognitive Distancing]] - Writing creates psychological distance for more objective examination of ideas

## PKM Philosophy

- [[Purpose of my PKM system]] - Externalising thinking to capitalise on cognitive strengths despite ADHD challenges
- [[PKM as Process vs Product]] - Capturing the messy journey of discovery rather than just polished conclusions

## Practical Implementation

- [[Thought Capture as a Core Thought Partner Feature]] - Low-friction methods for recording ideas as they occur
- [[My Vision of a Thought Partner]] - Digital systems that seamlessly support the externalisation process

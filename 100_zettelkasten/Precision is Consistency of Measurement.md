Precision describes the reproducibility and consistency of a measurement. It refers to how close multiple measurements of the same item are to each other, regardless of their proximity to the true value.

Precision is a measure of a measurement's reliability and is primarily affected by random errors—unpredictable fluctuations in readings. For instance, weighing an object five times and getting the exact same weight each time is a sign of high precision, even if that weight is inaccurate.

## Layer 3 Network Security Protects IP Routing and Forwarding

**Summary:** Layer 3 (Network Layer) security focuses on protecting IP packet routing, filtering, and forwarding operations in network infrastructure.

**Key aspects:**
- Operates at the IP packet level (OSI Layer 3)
- Protects against threats like:
  - IP spoofing
  - Denial of Service (DoS)
  - Session hijacking
- Implemented through:
  - Firewalls
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs)
  - Secure routing tables

**Comparison to Layer 2 security:**
While Layer 2 protects data frames (MAC addresses), Layer 3 secures logical addressing (IP) and routing between networks.

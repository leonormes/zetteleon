By treating time as a fixed, finite resource, timeboxing introduces a scarcity mindset that forces ruthless prioritization and efficiency.

When every time slot is a commitment, any new or non-essential activity must be carefully scrutinized before it is allowed onto the schedule. This constraint-driven approach helps to eliminate time-wasting activities that might otherwise fill an unstructured day.

This aligns with [[Parkinson's Law]], which states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. By creating a fixed and limited container for a task, timeboxing forces a more focused and efficient execution.

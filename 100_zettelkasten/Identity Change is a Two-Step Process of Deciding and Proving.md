## Identity Change is a Two-Step Process of Deciding and Proving

**What:** A simple path to changing who you are through action.

**How:**
1.  **Decide:** First, decide the type of person you want to be. This can be framed as a statement ("I'm the type of person who is consistent") or a question ("What would a healthy person do?").
2.  **Prove:** Second, prove it to yourself with small wins. Take tiny actions that reinforce your desired identity, casting votes for that new self.

**Failure modes:**
- Deciding on an identity but failing to take any action to prove it.
- Taking actions that are too large and unsustainable, leading to failure and reinforcing a negative identity.

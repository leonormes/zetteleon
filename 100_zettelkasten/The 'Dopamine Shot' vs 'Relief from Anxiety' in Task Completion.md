A critical distinction in motivational processing between ADHD and neurotypical brains lies in the subjective experience of completing a task.

- Neurotypical Experience: Completing a task, even an unenjoyable one, often results in a "little shot of dopamine." This creates a genuine feeling of pleasure or satisfaction, intrinsically reinforcing the behavior of "getting things done." This is a core feature of [[Neurotypical motivation is primarily importance-driven]].
- ADHD Experience: Completing an unpleasurable task typically brings only "relief from the anxiety" associated with it. There is often no feeling of pleasure or pride, and the struggle involved can negate any sense of accomplishment. The primary "reward" is the cessation of discomfort.

This difference explains why external rewards and importance are less effective for ADHD brains, as explored in [[Why Importance and Rewards Fail to Motivate ADHD Brains]]. The brain's reward system doesn't provide the same positive reinforcement loop.

## Every Action is a Vote for a Desired Identity

**Summary:** Every action you take can be seen as a metaphorical "vote" for the type of person you wish to become.

**Details:** Each time you perform a habit, you are casting a vote for a particular identity. Writing a page makes you a writer. Practicing an instrument makes you a musician. These individual actions accumulate over time to form the evidence that shapes your belief in your own identity.

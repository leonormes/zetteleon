Bravery, also known as courage, is the inner strength to face things that are frightening or difficult.

It is not necessarily the absence of fear, but rather the willingness to act despite it. This can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Trying something new and uncertain.
- Speaking up for what is right, even when it is unpopular.
- Facing a challenge or threat directly.

It is a core component of resilience and personal growth.

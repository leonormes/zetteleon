The essence of the Zettelkasten system resides in the mental processes of the individual using it. The true value of the system lies in how it supports and enhances the cognitive functions of the user.

Without a brain's involvement, the Zettelkasten does not exist. The system’s utility and existence are entangled with the active engagement of the user's mind. Without the cognitive functions of thinking, interpreting, and making connections, the Zettelkasten is just a collection of inert information. It requires the dynamic and active participation of a brain for it to come to life.

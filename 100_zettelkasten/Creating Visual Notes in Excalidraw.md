title: Creating Visual Notes in Excalidraw

The goal of creating visual notes is idea *arrangement*, not artistic perfection.

- Start a new drawing via the Command Palette: "Create new Excalidraw drawing."
- Use simple icons or symbols as recognition triggers for atomic ideas.
- Label shapes with single words.
- Use arrows or connectors to show relationships.
- To link to other notes, right-click and select "Insert link to Obsidian note."

You can draw using a mouse or trackpad. The primary shortcuts are:

- **P**: Pen
- **R**: Rectangle
- **E**: Ellipse
- **L**: Line
- **T**: Text

This part of the statement is not supported by the sources and is, in fact, contradicted. The provided texts indicate that individuals with ADHD tend to be more inclined towards risk-taking and find "easy" tasks boring.

- "Risk taking and irrational thinking go hand in hand with ADHD behavior".
- Individuals with ADHD are described as those who "jump right in without testing the waters first," characteristic of a higher-risk approach.
- The concept of "finding your right difficult" is crucial for ADHD brains, as they "want what others avoid" and "need the stimulation of intense challenge" because "easy is boring". This directly counteracts the idea of preferring low-risk activities.

[[ADHD brains are predisposed to lean toward passive activities that offer immediate gratification]]

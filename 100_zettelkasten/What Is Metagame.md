A strategic approach that operates beyond direct competition, focusing on manipulating the environment, rules, or context to influence outcomes. Like a chess player thinking several moves ahead, metagame strategists shape the conditions that determine success.

## Core Mechanism

Metagame strategy works through:

1. Identifying leverage points outside direct competition
2. Manipulating context and environment
3. Shaping perceptions and expectations
4. Exploiting system dynamics

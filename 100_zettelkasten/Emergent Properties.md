Emergent properties are characteristics that arise when individual components of a system interact, resulting in new behaviors or properties that are not present in the individual parts alone.

## Why It Matters

Understanding emergent properties helps explain complex systems in fields like chemistry and biology, where interactions lead to new phenomena.

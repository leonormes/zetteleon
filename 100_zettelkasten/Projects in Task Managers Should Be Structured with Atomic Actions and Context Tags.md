## Projects in Task Managers Should Be Structured with Atomic Actions and Context Tags

**What:** Guidance on how to structure projects within task management software for maximum clarity and actionability.

**How:**
-   **Sections:** Divide projects into logical sections (e.g., "Design," "Development").
-   **Atomic Actions:** Ensure every task listed is an atomic action (discrete, physical, visible, unambiguous).
-   **Context Tags:** Apply relevant context tags (e.g., `@computer`, `@high_energy`) to all actions.
-   **Starter Tasks:** For difficult-to-initiate actions, include a preceding `@starter_task`.

**Example:**

```sh
Project: Website Redesign
  Section: Design
    ├─ @starter_task: Open Google Drive (1 min)
    ├─ @computer: Create shared folder for mockups (3 min)
    └─ @computer + @high_energy: Draft initial homepage layout (30 min)
```

## Rhizome Structure - Non-Hierarchical Network

**Summary:** Zettelkasten is organized as a rhizome—a non-hierarchical, distributed network with multiple entry points and no single root. Ideas connect through relationships, not predetermined categories.

**Details:** The rhizome metaphor, borrowed from Deleuze and Guattari's philosophy, describes a network structure that grows horizontally through connections rather than vertically through hierarchy. Unlike a tree (one root, branching hierarchy), a rhizome has multiple entry and exit points, connections at any level, and no privileged center. In Zettelkasten, this means: notes aren't organized into nested folders or predetermined topic hierarchies; any note can connect to any other note; there's no "correct" place to start browsing; and structure emerges from the relationships between ideas rather than imposed categories. This creates "controlled chaos"—apparent disorder that actually embodies a more flexible, organic order based on conceptual relationships. The rhizomatic structure enables the system to accommodate contradictions, support multiple perspectives, and discover unexpected connections that rigid hierarchies would prevent. It's fundamentally a bottom-up organization where meaning emerges from the network itself.

When a system is [[Systems are Blind to Their Broader Context|blind to external context]], it cannot import its logic or values from the outside. It is therefore forced to generate its own self-referential framework of rules, logic, and meaning.

This internal "operating system" is created out of its own components and history, allowing it to function and self-regulate in isolation. This process of Self-Organisation gives rise to [[Emergence|emergent]] properties like unique cultures, behaviors, and priorities that are specific to the system itself, often governed by internal Feedback Loops.

The result of this internal generation is a profound perceptual dichotomy, where [[The Meaning of a System's Logic is Relative to Perspective]].

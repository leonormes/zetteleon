"Motion Creates Emotion" is a principle that states motivation follows action, rather than the other way around. This is a cornerstone of [[ADHD Behavioral Strategies for Productivity]], as waiting to "feel" motivated is often a losing battle for a dopamine-deficient brain.

The strategy is to bypass the need for initial motivation by starting with a ridiculously small, low-friction action (a "micro-action" or "starter task"). The act of starting, no matter how small, begins to generate momentum and engages the brain's reward system, making it easier to continue the task.

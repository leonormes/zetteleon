title: A Coherent System of Units Simplifies Physical Equations

A key strength of the SI for science is its **coherence**. This means that the equations between the numerical values of quantities have the exact same form as the equations between the quantities themselves, with no extra conversion factors.

For example, in the physical equation for force, F=ma:

- If you use the coherent SI units of **newtons (N)** for force, **kilograms (kg)** for mass, and **metres per second squared (m/s2)** for acceleration, the numerical calculation is direct. `1 N = 1 kg * 1 m/s²`.

If you were to use non-coherent units (like kilometres per hour for speed), you would need to insert numerical conversion factors into the equation, making it more complex and prone to error. This property makes the SI the fundamental language of physics and engineering.

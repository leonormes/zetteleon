Mental models and emotions exist in a constant bidirectional feedback loop where each continuously creates and reinforces the other. This is fundamental to understanding how our internal worlds operate—our brains don't have separate departments for "thinking" and "feeling."

## The Two-Way Process

**Emotion Shapes the Model**: Strong emotional events act like a highlighter, marking experiences as important and ensuring they get saved into long-term mental models. A single frightening experience can build a powerful model associating certain situations with danger.

**The Model Triggers Emotion**: Once built, the model becomes an active filter for reality. The brain uses this model to interpret ambiguous sensory data and predict potential outcomes. When the model is activated, it preemptively triggers emotions and physiological responses, even if there's no actual threat present.

## Example: The Untrustworthy Colleague

- **The Model**: "Alex is always trying to undermine me"
- **The Situation**: Alex sends an email pointing out a small error in your report
- **The Loop in Action**:
  - Brain interprets this neutral event through the "untrustworthy Alex" model
  - Interpretation becomes "Alex is trying to make me look bad" rather than "Alex is being helpful"
  - This interpretation triggers emotional response: anger, suspicion, anxiety
  - The emotion reinforces the original model: "See? I was right to be suspicious"

This self-reinforcing cycle is how biases become entrenched and how phobias and anxiety disorders develop. The model creates the feeling, and the feeling validates the model, often preventing us from taking in new information that might challenge it.

This principle is the foundation of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which helps people identify negative mental models that automatically trigger painful emotions.

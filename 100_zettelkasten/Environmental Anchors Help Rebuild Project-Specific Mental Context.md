## Environmental Anchors Help Rebuild Project-Specific Mental Context

**Summary:** Environmental anchors are consistent physical or digital cues used during work sessions to help the brain associate a specific environment with a project's mental context.

**Details:** The brain is adept at linking context to physical spaces and rituals. By creating a dedicated workspace (physical or digital), using a specific playlist, or having a consistent scent, you create a sensory "shortcut" that helps you more quickly re-enter the project mindset.

A **starter task** (often tagged as `@starter_task`) is a specific type of next action that has been engineered to be so small and simple that it requires virtually zero cognitive effort to begin. Its primary function is not to make significant progress, but to build momentum.

## The Three Rules of a Starter Task

1.  **Purpose: Build Momentum Only**
    The task's sole goal is to break inertia. It is not about completing a meaningful chunk of work. *Example: "Open the presentation software," not "Create the first three slides."*

2.  **Duration: 5-15 Minutes Maximum**
    A starter task must be completable in a very short time frame. The ideal is 1-5 minutes. If it takes longer, it is not a starter task because it risks creating its own activation energy barrier. *Example: "Clear off one corner of the desk," not "Organize the office."*

3.  **Simplicity: Single, Non-Complex Physical Action**
    The action should be immediately doable without any prior planning, decision-making, or resource gathering. It must be a concrete physical step. *Example: "Open a new document and title it," not "Outline the report."*

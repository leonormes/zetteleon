The Focusing Illusion is a cognitive bias where people place too much importance on one aspect of an event, causing them to misjudge the reality of the situation.

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman summarized it as: "Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it."

For example, when two people are in an argument, they might focus intensely on a perceived slight, allocating it an immense level of importance that fades shortly after the emotional peak has passed. This is a key mechanism within [[Contextual Myopia and Goal Displacement]].

This concept is derived from the broader conversation in [[Contextual Myopia and Human Behavior]].

## Type 2 Information is Active and Empirical

**Summary:** Type 2 information is knowledge generated by taking a direct, tangible action and observing an immediate, real-world result.

**Details:** This category includes activities like writing a line of code to see if it compiles, running a unit test, or making a single API call. This mode of learning is characterized by immediate, empirical feedback that confirms or denies a hypothesis. While it can feel psychologically risky because it has a high potential for immediate "failure" (errors), it provides a high and immediate dopamine payoff. The core strategy for breaking procrastination is to intentionally shift from gathering Type 1 information to generating Type 2 information.

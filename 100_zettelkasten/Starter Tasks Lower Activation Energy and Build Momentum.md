## Starter Tasks Lower Activation Energy and Build Momentum

**Summary:** Starter tasks work by systematically lowering activation energy, building momentum, creating immediate progress, bypassing overthinking, and reducing perfectionism.

**Details:**
-   **Lowers Activation Energy:** Makes starting feel infinitely easier than tackling the full task.
-   **Builds Momentum:** Once in motion, continuing is easier than starting (Newton's First Law applied to behavior).
-   **Creates Progress:** Even tiny progress provides a dopamine reward, reinforcing the behavior.
-   **Bypasses Overthinking:** The task is too small and simple to overthink.
-   **Reduces Perfectionism:** A binary, simple action leaves little room for perfectionistic tendencies.

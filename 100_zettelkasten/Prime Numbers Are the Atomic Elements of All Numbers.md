title: Prime Numbers Are the Atomic Elements of All Numbers

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). All other whole numbers are called composite numbers.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every whole number greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be expressed as a unique product of prime numbers. This makes primes the fundamental "building blocks" of all integers.

This uniqueness is critical for cryptography, as it guarantees a number n has only one pair of prime factors.

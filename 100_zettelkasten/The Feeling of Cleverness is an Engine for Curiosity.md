title: The Feeling of Cleverness is an Engine for Curiosity

The internal feeling of "being clever" when learning is often misinterpreted as a competitive ranking against others. It is more accurately understood as the subjective experience of the brain's learning reward system.

This feeling is not a delusion or a "fool's game". It is the engine of curiosity. It's a fundamental spark that motivates further exploration and learning. Mistaking this personal joy of discovery for a need to achieve public intellectual status can lead to frustration.

The goal is to enjoy this feeling for what it is: the pure joy of a mind making sense of complexity.

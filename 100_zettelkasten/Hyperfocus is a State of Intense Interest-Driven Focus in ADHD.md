Hyperfocus is a phenomenon experienced by individuals with ADHD where they can enter a state of intense, sustained concentration on a task that genuinely interests or intrigues them. During hyperfocus, typical ADHD impairments such as distractibility can seem to vanish, and executive functions related to the task can soar.

This state is a direct result of the [[The Interest-Based Nervous System in ADHD]] being fueled by a high level of intrinsic motivation, which generates a surge of dopamine. It demonstrates that the challenge in ADHD is not a lack of attention, but a dysregulation in the *direction* and *sustainment* of attention.

The ability to hyperfocus is a characteristic strength of ADHD, allowing for exceptional productivity and creativity on topics of interest. It directly counters the misconception that individuals with ADHD are simply "lazy" or "unfocused."

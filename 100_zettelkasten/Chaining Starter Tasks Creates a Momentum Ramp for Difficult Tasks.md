For tasks that are particularly daunting or have an extremely high activation energy, a single starter task may not be enough to build sufficient momentum. In these cases, **chaining starter tasks** can be an effective advanced technique.

This method involves creating a sequence of several, progressively larger micro-tasks that act as a "momentum ramp" into the main body of work.

## How It Works

Instead of having one starter task, you create a series of them, where each one leads naturally to the next. Each completed task provides a small dopamine hit and further lowers the psychological barrier to continuing.

## Example: Filing Taxes

A monolithic task like "File taxes" can be paralyzing. A chained starter task approach would look like this:

1.  `@starter_task_1`: Find last year's tax return file (2 min)
2.  `@starter_task_2`: Open the tax software website (1 min)
3.  `@starter_task_3`: Enter name and address into the software (3 min)
4.  Gather W-2 forms from the desk drawer.
5.  Begin entering W-2 information.

By the time the third, slightly more involved starter task is complete, the user is already actively engaged in the tax software, and the momentum is often sufficient to carry them into the core of the task.

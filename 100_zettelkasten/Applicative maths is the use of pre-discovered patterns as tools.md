Source: [[The Two Views of Maths]]

The Idea (In Detail):

It consists of a vast library of powerful, pre-existing patterns and structures (like algebra, calculus, statistics) that have been refined into reliable tools. The primary goal is to select the correct tool and apply it to a real-world problem to achieve a practical, predictable outcome. It is fundamentally utilitarian.

My Thoughts & Implications:

This is "maths as technology". It's incredibly powerful and forms the bedrock of science and engineering. However, focusing solely on this aspect can make maths feel like a closed, historical subject where all the answers are already in the book. There's no sense of discovery. This links to the idea that [[Public perception of maths is incomplete]].

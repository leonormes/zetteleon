## Goals Set the Direction for Change

**Summary:** Goals are the desired results you want to achieve, and their primary function is to set a clear direction for your efforts.

**Details:** A goal acts as a "North Star," providing a specific target and preventing the process of change from becoming aimless. It is the essential first step in forming an intention to act. However, focusing exclusively on goals is a flawed strategy because both winners and losers often share the same objectives, indicating that the goal itself is not the differentiating factor for success.

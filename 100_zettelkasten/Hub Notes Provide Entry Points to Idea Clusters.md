## Hub Notes Provide Entry Points to Idea Clusters

**Summary:** Hub notes function as access points or "highways between topics"—lists of links pointing toward trains of thought that have developed into clusters of connected ideas.

**Details:** In a non-hierarchical network, you need ways to enter the system and navigate to specific areas of developed thinking. Hub notes serve this purpose. They are specialized notes that contain lists of links to main notes organized around a theme or question that has accumulated substantial development. Think of them as highway on-ramps: they don't contain the ideas themselves, but they point you toward the roads (links) that lead to interesting destinations (idea clusters). Hub notes emerge organically—as you notice that a particular topic or question has spawned many connected notes, you create a hub to make that cluster easily accessible. They differ from structure notes in being simpler and more list-like; their purpose is pure navigation rather than building an argument. Hub notes are the Zettelkasten's answer to the question "How do I find things in this chaos?" They provide familiar entry points into the rhizomatic network without imposing rigid hierarchy.

## Pattern Recognition is an Efficient Cognitive Heuristic

**Summary:** Pattern recognition acts as a highly efficient cognitive heuristic by classifying new situations as instances of known patterns, bypassing the need to analyze every detail from first principles.

**Details:** This process provides an immense data-compression benefit. Evolution optimized this system for speed and survival, biasing it to avoid catastrophic errors. The cost of a false negative (missing a real threat) is far higher than the cost of a false positive (perceiving a threat that isn't there). This asymmetry explains the brain's tendency toward apophenia, as it is better to be safe than sorry.

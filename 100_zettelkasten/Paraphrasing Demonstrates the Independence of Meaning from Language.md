The fact that the same meaning can be expressed in many different ways is evidence that words and the concepts they represent are independent things. If a concept were inextricably tied to a specific set of words, paraphrasing would be impossible; changing the words would change the meaning.

This separation allows for the richness of language. We can explore different facets of a single idea by expressing it in various ways.

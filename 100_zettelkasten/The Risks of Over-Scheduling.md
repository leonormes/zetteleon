While timeboxing provides valuable structure, an overly rigid or packed schedule can be counterproductive and lead to negative consequences.

Key risks include:

- **Rigidity:** A schedule that cannot adapt to unexpected events or changing priorities can become a source of stress.
- **Burnout:** Filling every available moment with productive tasks without adequate rest can lead to exhaustion.
- **Lack of Spontaneity:** An over-planned life leaves no room for serendipity, creativity, or spontaneous activities.
- **Stress:** A schedule that is too ambitious or tightly packed can create a constant feeling of being behind, inducing anxiety.

Effective timeboxing requires a balance between structure and flexibility to remain a sustainable practice.

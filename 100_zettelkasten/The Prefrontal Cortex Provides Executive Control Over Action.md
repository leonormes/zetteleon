# The Prefrontal Cortex Provides Executive Control Over Action

**Summary:** The prefrontal cortex (PFC) acts as the brain's executive control center, responsible for maintaining representations of goals and guiding the neural activity required to achieve them.

**Details:** The PFC sends bias signals throughout the brain to orchestrate task performance. Different subregions handle distinct functions: the dorsolateral PFC manages working memory and planning, while ventromedial regions evaluate risk and reward. This hierarchical system allows for the management of complex, goal-directed behavior, from responding to immediate external cues to following abstract, internally-held rules.

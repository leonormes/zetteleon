title: ADHD Paralysis is the Inability to Start a Task Until it Becomes an Emergency
type: concept

"ADHD Paralysis" describes a state where an individual with ADHD is unable to initiate a task. This often occurs because the brain's reward system is not sufficiently stimulated by the task itself. The paralysis is only broken when the task becomes an acute emergency, which provides a large enough dopamine rush to finally trigger action.

## Cognitive Gridlock

This state of inaction is a cognitive "freeze response" triggered by executive dysfunction. When faced with a complex project, the impaired ability to sequence and prioritize tasks creates a gridlock. The brain, unable to engage its activation system, defaults to *thinking about the task* as a substitute for action. This creates a negative feedback loop:

1.  Inability to plan generates a feeling of being overwhelmed.
2.  To escape this aversive feeling, the brain defaults to avoidance and procrastination.
3.  Avoidance allows pressure to mount, making the task more intimidating.
4.  The sense of overwhelm escalates, entrenching the paralysis further.

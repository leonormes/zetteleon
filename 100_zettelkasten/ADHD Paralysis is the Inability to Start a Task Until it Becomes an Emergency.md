"ADHD Paralysis" describes a state where an individual with ADHD is unable to initiate a task. This often occurs because the brain's reward system is not sufficiently stimulated by the task itself. The paralysis is only broken when the task becomes an acute emergency, which provides a large enough dopamine rush to finally trigger action.

## Communication is Inherently Lossy like Image Compression

**Summary:** The process of translating internal mental states into language and back involves unavoidable information loss, similar to compressing a high-resolution image into a lower-resolution format.

**Details:** Communication follows a four-step process: (1) having an idea as a neural pattern, (2) encoding it into language, (3) the listener decoding the words, (4) recreating a mental representation. Each step introduces potential loss or distortion. The richness of the original mental state - including sensory components, emotional associations, and contextual nuances - can never be perfectly captured in linguistic symbols. This explains why truly novel or complex ideas are difficult to communicate and why we often need multiple attempts or different phrasings to convey meaning.

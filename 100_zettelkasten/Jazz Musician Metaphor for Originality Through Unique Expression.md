## Jazz Musician Metaphor for Originality Through Unique Expression

**Summary:** Jazz musicians share notes and forms yet create originality through phrasing, timing, and interplay; structure enables freedom.

**Details:** Jazz musicians share the same notes, scales, and standards, yet originality emerges from phrasing, timing, and interplay with the moment. Structure enables freedom: constraints like chord changes create the canvas for improvisation. Your thinking works the same way; by mastering shared forms and then bending them, you express a voice that is unmistakably yours. This metaphor reframes influence as the medium of creativity.

Cognitive dissonance is the psychological discomfort experienced when a person holds two or more conflicting beliefs, values, or ideas, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.

This state of mental stress is a powerful motivator, driving an individual to resolve the conflict. This is explored in [[Psychological Stress of Dissonance]].

The conflict itself can be triggered by [[Triggers of Cognitive Dissonance|conflicting beliefs or new, contradictory information]]. To alleviate the discomfort, individuals adopt various [[Conflict Resolution in Cognitive Dissonance|resolution strategies]].

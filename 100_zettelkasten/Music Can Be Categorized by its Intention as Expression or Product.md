## Music Can Be Categorized by Its Intention as Expression or Product

**Summary:** A core concept in understanding music is the distinction between music born from a need for authentic expression and music designed primarily as a commercial product.

**Details:** This is not a value judgment of "good" vs. "bad," but a distinction of origin and intent. Music as expression originates from a raw human feeling or need, while music as a product originates from a market-driven goal. Understanding this difference provides a lens for deeper analysis of art.

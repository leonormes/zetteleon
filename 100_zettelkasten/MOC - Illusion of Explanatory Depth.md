The [[Illusion of Explanatory Depth (IoED)]] is a pervasive cognitive bias. It occurs because [[Familiarity is Mistaken for Comprehension in IoED]]; we take superficial cues as evidence of deep knowledge. This happens because [[Flawed Self-Assessment is the Root of IoED]], whereby we fail to actively test our understanding and instead rely on weak external signals.

title: The 2019 SI Redefinition is Based on Fundamental Constants

## The Old Problem

The SI was previously based on physical artefacts, most notably the **International Prototype of the Kilogram**—a cylinder of platinum-iridium kept in France. This created problems because physical objects can be lost, damaged, or change mass over time, which undermines the reliability of the entire system.

## The Modern Solution

In **2019**, the SI was redefined. Instead of relying on artefacts, the definitions of the base units are now based on fixing the exact numerical values of **seven defining physical constants**. These include:

- The speed of light, c.
- The Planck constant, h.
- The elementary charge, e.

This shift makes the SI units more abstract and idealised but also more stable and universally reproducible. It also revealed [[How SI Base Units Are Interconnected]].

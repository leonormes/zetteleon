## Asking Why a Song Exists Helps Determine Its Authenticity

**What:** A simple question to ask to understand the origin and intent of a piece of music.

**How:**
- When listening to a song, ask: "Why does this song exist?"
- Consider the two main possibilities:
  1. Did it exist because an artist had a burning need to express something?
  2. Or was it created because a company identified a market need?

**Example:**
- An early Bob Dylan song likely exists because he felt a need to comment on social injustice.
- A modern pop song that sounds very similar to other hits may exist because a record label identified a profitable trend.

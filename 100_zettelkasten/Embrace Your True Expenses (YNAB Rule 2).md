"Embrace Your True Expenses" is the YNAB principle for handling large, irregular, but predictable costs (e.g., annual insurance premiums, car repairs, holidays). Instead of treating them as unexpected emergencies that incur debt, this rule reframes them as monthly expenses.

The method involves dividing the total estimated cost by the number of months until it's due and saving that amount each month. This practice smooths out large expenses over time, ensuring the money is available when needed and preventing the cycle of falling into debt to cover predictable costs. This rule is a key part of the proactive planning started with [[Give Every Dollar a Job (YNAB Rule 1)]].

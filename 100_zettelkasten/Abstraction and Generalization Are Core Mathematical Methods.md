**Summary:** Abstraction and generalization are fundamental mathematical methods that enable mathematicians to move from specific instances to universal structures, capturing invariant properties across diverse contexts.

**Details:**

Mathematicians generalize rules and concepts learned in specific contexts to broader, more abstract scenarios. This process:

- **Identifies commonalities:** Recognizes shared structure across different examples
- **Strips away particulars:** Removes context-specific details to reveal underlying patterns
- **Captures invariants:** Focuses on properties that remain constant under transformation

**Example:**

Algebra generalizes the rules of arithmetic by using variables for unknown values. Instead of working with specific numbers like 2 + 3 = 5, algebra works with general patterns like x + y = z. The ability to "let 2 = n" (generalize from particular to all cases) is the "true art of the mathematician."

**Power:**

Abstraction allows a single theorem or method to apply simultaneously to infinitely many cases. This is why mathematics achieves such remarkable economy and power—one abstract result can encompass countless specific applications.

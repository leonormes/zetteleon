# Time Boxing Can Be Nested Within Larger Time Blocks

**Summary:** The true power of time blocking and time boxing often emerges when they are used in a complementary, layered fashion.

**Details:** One can use time blocking to define the overarching structure of the day (e.g., a two-hour block for "Idea Development"). Within that larger block, time boxing can be applied to specific sub-tasks (e.g., "Brainstorm concepts: 30 minutes," "Outline ideas: 45 minutes"). This approach leverages the strengths of both methods: time blocking ensures dedicated time, while time boxing drives focused progress within that time.

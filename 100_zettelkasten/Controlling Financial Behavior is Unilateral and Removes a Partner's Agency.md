# Controlling Financial Behavior is Unilateral and Removes a Partner's Agency

**Summary:** Financial behavior becomes controlling when one person's process removes the other's autonomy and dignity, often by making unilateral decisions and policing their partner's spending.

**Details:** Signs of controlling behavior include one partner dictating family goals, demanding to see every receipt, cross-examining minor purchases, and providing an "allowance" rather than ensuring mutual access to funds. This creates a parent-child dynamic and strips the other partner of their agency.

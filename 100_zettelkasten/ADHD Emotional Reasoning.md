Individuals with ADHD may fall into this thinking trap, assuming that their negative emotions accurately reflect the truth. For example, feeling anxious about a social event might lead them to believe that everyone will judge them harshly.

This is a specific manifestation of [[Emotional Reasoning]] that's particularly common in ADHD brains due to [[Emotional Dysregulation]]. The intensity of emotions in ADHD can make them feel more "true" or valid as sources of information about reality.

## The ADHD Connection

ADHD brains are prone to emotional reasoning because:

- [[Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)]] amplifies perceived rejection or criticism
- Executive function challenges make it harder to step back and evaluate emotions objectively
- The neurological differences in emotional processing create more intense emotional experiences

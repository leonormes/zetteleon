The "prediction error" generated by the [[Predictive Processing and the Bayesian Brain|Predictive Processing framework]] is not just a computational signal; it has a profound biochemical effect, primarily through the release of **dopamine**.

Dopamine is not just about pleasure; it is the brain's chemical messenger for **salience, motivation, and reinforcement**. It signals that something important and potentially rewarding has occurred, and that the brain's world model needs to be updated.

- When reality matches a prediction, dopamine levels remain at baseline.
- When a **positive prediction error** occurs (something unexpectedly good or interesting happens), midbrain neurons fire, releasing a surge of dopamine. This feels good and, crucially, enhances synaptic plasticity, effectively "stamping in" the new information and forcing an update to the mental model.

## The ADHD Connection

This mechanism is particularly relevant to ADHD, which is theorized to involve **dopamine dysregulation**. For a brain with less efficient dopamine signaling, routine tasks are profoundly understimulating, as they offer zero prediction error and thus no dopamine reward. This makes it difficult to maintain focus.

Therefore, the drive to seek out novelty, quirks, and the unexpected is a subconscious neurobiological strategy. It is a way of actively seeking out experiences that generate a high prediction error, as this provides the necessary dopamine surge to bring the brain to an optimal state of arousal and focus.

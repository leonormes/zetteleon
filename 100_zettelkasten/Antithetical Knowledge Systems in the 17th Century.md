The intellectual landscape of the 17th century provides a powerful illustration of diversity through the flourishing and coexistence of two antithetical approaches to knowledge: alchemy and mathematics.

- Alchemy: Pursued truth via secrecy and appeal to ancient authority.
- Mathematics: Pursued truth via openness and rigorous, demonstrable logic.

That these two fundamentally opposed systems could both be seen as legitimate and thriving paths to understanding reveals the transitional nature of the era, standing between ancient mysticism and the emerging scientific revolution.

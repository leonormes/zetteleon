## The Polish of Commercial Music is Designed to Maximize Consumption

**Summary:** The highly polished and refined sound of commercial music is an intentional feature designed to remove any "friction" that might cause a listener to tune out.

**Details:** Just like a commercial product such as a phone or a film, commercial music is often tested, refined, and packaged to be as smooth and palatable as possible. The goal of this extensive polishing is to maximize its appeal and ensure mass consumption.

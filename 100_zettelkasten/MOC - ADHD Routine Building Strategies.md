This note outlines strategies for building effective and sustainable routines for individuals with ADHD, based on the principles from ADHD coach Caren Magill.

## Key Principles

Successful routine building for ADHD requires a different approach than what works for neurotypical individuals.

- [[ADHD-friendly routines must be individualized and not based on neurotypical systems|Routines must be ADHD-friendly and individualized]], avoiding generic self-help scripts.
- The primary challenge is not inconsistency but that [[Unrealistic expectations are the main obstacle to building ADHD routines|unrealistic expectations and changing too much too fast]] leads to failure.
- The same mechanism that forms "bad" habits can be used to create good ones through repeated behavior.

## Action Steps for ADHD-Friendly Routines

### 1. Start With Real Needs
- [[ADHD routines should be based on intrinsic motivation not external pressure|Routines must be based on intrinsic motivation]], answering the question "Why does this matter to me?" rather than following external trends.

### 2. Reduce Friction
- A core strategy is to [[Reducing friction is a key strategy for building ADHD-friendly habits|identify and reduce friction points]] by starting with the simplest possible tweaks to build momentum.

### 3. Make It Easy
- [[Making a behavior easy increases the likelihood it will become a habit|The easier a behavior is, the more likely it will stick]]. New habits should be layered in one at a time after the previous one feels automatic.

### 4. Build Self-Trust
- [[Building self-trust is essential for creating sustainable ADHD routines|Building self-trust is essential]]. This involves trusting your intuition and allowing your routine to look different from others'.

### 5. Provide Immediate Rewards
- Because the ADHD brain is wired for immediate gratification, [[ADHD habit building requires immediate feedback or reward loops|building in immediate feedback or reward loops]] is a powerful technique to reinforce a new habit.

## Example Workflow

1.  **Pick one area to optimize** (e.g., morning chaos).
2.  **Note friction points** (e.g., forgetting essentials).
3.  **Identify the smallest possible change** (e.g., set out clothes the night before).
4.  **Layer in one change at a time** until it feels automatic.
5.  **Gradually add more tweaks**, always checking for intrinsic motivation.

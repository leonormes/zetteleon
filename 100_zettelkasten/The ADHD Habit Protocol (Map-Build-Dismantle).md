## The ADHD Habit Protocol (Map-Build-Dismantle)

The ADHD Habit Protocol is a three-step, CBT-based framework for building good habits and dismantling bad ones, designed specifically for the ADHD brain's need for structure and stimulation over willpower.

### Step 1: Map Your Habit Loop

Before changing a habit, you must first understand its architecture. This involves identifying the components of the habit loop:

- **Cue**: The trigger (a situation, feeling, or time of day).
- **Automatic Thoughts**: The internal monologue that follows the cue.
- **Feelings**: The emotional response.
- **Routine**: The behavioral reaction.
- **Result**: The reward or consequence.

Mapping makes the unconscious patterns visible and, therefore, changeable.

### Step 2: Build Better Habits

This step focuses on designing new routines that are ADHD-friendly.

- **Match Energy Patterns**: Build routines for your *real* self, not an idealized version.
- **Use Micro-Steps**: Break down the desired habit into a clear, sequential chain of tiny actions.
- **Reinforce the Loop**: Use tools like **If-Then rules** ("If it's 2:30, then I go to the gym"), **habit stacking** (pairing a new habit with an existing one), and **gamified feedback** (e.g., streak counters) to create dopamine through progress.

The goal is to make the routine itself the source of motivation.

### Step 3: Dismantle Bad Habits

Bad habits are not broken through resistance, but through **replacement**.

- Keep the same **Cue** and **Reward**.
- Swap the **Routine** with a more constructive behavior that provides a similar reward.
- *Example*: When the cue is a feeling of overwhelm, replace the routine of doomscrolling with the routine of a 2-minute brain dump in a notebook. The reward is the same: a feeling of calm and control.

### Connections

- This protocol is a structured approach to [[ADHD Behavioral Strategies for Productivity]].
- It acknowledges that for ADHD, Ambiguity triggers avoidance, so clarity and pre-commitment are key.

title: Sunk Cost Fallacy Reinforces Myopia

The sunk cost fallacy can create a powerful self-reinforcing loop that entrenches a narrow focus. When an individual has invested significant time, effort, or ego into a particular task or perspective (often due to [[Contextual Myopia]]), they are reluctant to abandon it. To justify the past investment, they escalate their commitment. This escalation then requires the creation of artificial justifications for why the current focus is critically important, thereby deepening the myopic state.

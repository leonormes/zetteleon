One of the most powerful applications of [[Writing as a Thinking Tool]] is in the demystification of complex or "hard" subjects. William Zinsser argued that he could have overcome his fear of science and math if he had known how to "write and thereby reason my way into those disciplines."

When you force yourself to explain a difficult concept in writing, even if just to yourself, you engage in a process that:

1. **Exposes Gaps in Understanding:** Vague notions are forced into the open. You quickly discover what you don't actually know.
2. **Forces Sequential Logic:** Writing is a linear act. You must structure the idea step-by-step, which often clarifies the logical connections within the subject itself.
3. **Makes Knowledge Your Own:** By translating a concept into your own words and connecting it to your own experiences, you move from passively consuming information to actively constructing knowledge.

A professor in Zinsser's book noted that by having students write out how they arrived at a result, the teacher could see how their mind worked, and the student could rethink the process. This is the essence of using writing to learn.

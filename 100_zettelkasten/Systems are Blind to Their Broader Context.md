Any defined system, whether it be a biological cell, a corporate culture, or a belief system, operates according to its own internal rules and information. By its very nature, it is bounded and cannot perceive the full context or "meta-system" in which it exists. Its operational reality is limited to the information within its own boundaries, rendering it inherently blind to external realities, purposes, or logics that lie outside its scope.

This blindness is the necessary precondition that forces systems to create their own internal rules, as described in [[Systems Generate Internal Logic in Isolation]].

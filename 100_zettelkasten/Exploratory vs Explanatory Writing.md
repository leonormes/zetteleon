William Zinsser, in "Writing to Learn," provides a crucial distinction between two modes of writing that is essential for using a PKM as a thinking tool.

1. **Exploratory Writing (or "Type B")**
   - **Purpose:** To discover what you want to say. This is writing for yourself.
   - **Characteristics:** It is messy, raw, personal, and often non-linear. It includes questions, half-formed ideas, and emotional reactions. It is the process of defrosting the windshield to see the idea clearly.
   - **In a PKM:** This is the primary mode for creating atomic "thought notes." It is the essence of [[Writing as a Thinking Tool]].

2. **Explanatory Writing (or "Type A")**
   - **Purpose:** To transmit existing information or ideas clearly to an audience. This is writing for others (even if your "other" is your future self).
   - **Characteristics:** It is structured, logical, and polished. It presents a conclusion.
   - **In a PKM:** This is the mode used for creating [[Structure Notes as Maps of Thought Trails]] or summarizing a topic once you have understood it through exploratory writing.

[[The Disappointment of Written Thoughts]] often arises from judging our necessary exploratory writing by the standards of explanatory writing. We must grant ourselves permission to be messy in the exploratory phase.

Based on your note, exploratory writing is the act of using writing as a tool for thinking, rather than as a tool for communication. It's the process of figuring out what you think about something.

Think of it as having a conversation with yourself on the page. It's the "backstage" of your thinking, and it's essential for developing genuine understanding.

## The Mindset of Exploratory Writing

The core mindset is to remove all pressure of performance. This is writing for yourself. No one else needs to see it, so all self-censorship about style, grammar, or "sounding smart" should be abandoned.

- It's a Process, Not a Product: The goal isn't to create a polished note. The goal is to have a thought. The text you produce is just the evidence of that thinking.
- Embrace the Mess: Your note perfectly describes it as "messy, raw, personal, and often non-linear". This is a feature, not a bug. Thinking is not a clean, A-to-B process.
- Follow Curiosity: Your only guide is your own curiosity and confusion. If you have a question, write it down. If you have a "half-formed idea," write it down.
- "Defrosting the Windshield": This analogy from your note is key. You don't start with a clear view. The act of writing is the act of clearing the view, bit by bit. You write to achieve clarity, not because you already have it.

## How to Practise This in Your PKM

Your note correctly identifies this as the "primary mode for creating atomic 'thought notes'". Here are some practical ways to do that:

- Start with a Question: Create a new note and title it with a question. E.g., Why is exploratory writing so difficult? or What's the real connection between Concept A and Concept B?. Then, just try to answer it.
- Transcribe Your Inner Monologue: Literally write what you're thinking.
  - Example: "I'm reading this article on X, and I'm not sure I get the main point. The author says... but that seems to contradict... oh, wait. Maybe they mean... yeah, that makes more sense. It's like Concept Y. But what about...?"
- Use Prompts: When you're stuck, use prompts to get moving:
  - "I'm trying to figure out..."
  - "What this reminds me of is..."
  - "The part I'm confused about is..."
  - "My first reaction to this is..."
- Link As You Think: As soon as a connection to another idea pops into your head, link it. This feels a lot like [[The Disappointment of Written Thoughts]]. This is how you build the "Maps of Thought Trails" your note mentions.
- Embrace Fragments: An atomic note doesn't have to be a full essay. It can be a single sentence, a quote with a one-line reaction, or a list of questions.
  The most important step, as your note wisely points out, is to stop judging this "Type B" writing by "Type A" standards. Grant yourself permission for this exploratory phase to be messy. It's the generative, foundational work that makes clear, explanatory writing possible later.

title: Prediction Error Breaks Maladaptive Feedback Loops

The primary mechanism that prevents [[The Cognitive-Emotional Feedback Loop]] from constantly causing problems is **reality testing** through **prediction error**.

The brain is a prediction engine. A maladaptive model (e.g., "public speaking is always a catastrophe") constantly makes negative predictions and triggers fear. This loop is kept in check when reality provides a strong **prediction error signal**—a mismatch between the predicted outcome and the actual outcome.

- **The Situation:** You give a short talk.
- **The Prediction:** Your model predicts disaster and social humiliation.
- **The Actual Outcome:** You receive polite applause. The disaster did not occur.
- **The Error Signal:** The large gap between the prediction and reality generates a powerful error signal.

This signal acts as a catalyst for change, weakening the old emotional association and forcing the brain to slowly update the model. This is the core principle behind **exposure therapy** for anxiety, which works by repeatedly generating prediction errors until the faulty model is rewritten.

This process is driven by the [[Predictive Processing and the Bayesian Brain]] framework, where learning is fundamentally about minimizing prediction error over time.

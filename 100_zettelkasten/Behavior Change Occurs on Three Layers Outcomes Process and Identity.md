## Behavior Change Occurs on Three Layers Outcomes Process and Identity

**Summary:** Behavior change can be understood as occurring on three interdependent layers, similar to an onion.

**Details:**
1.  **Outcomes (Outer Layer):** This layer is concerned with changing results (e.g., losing weight, publishing a book). It is about what you *get*.
2.  **Process (Middle Layer):** This layer is concerned with changing habits and systems (e.g., going to the gym, writing daily). It is about what you *do*.
3.  **Identity (Deepest Layer):** This layer is concerned with changing beliefs, worldview, and self-image. It is about what you *believe*.

## Felt Significance of Thoughts Can Mislead about Their Substance

**Summary:** The phenomenological experience of a thought feeling important, profound, or insightful is not a reliable indicator of the thought's actual novelty, validity, or substance—these are separate dimensions that often dissociate.

**Details:**

There is a systematic gap between:

- **Felt significance**: The subjective sense that a thought is important, profound, or insightful
- **Actual substance**: The objective quality, novelty, validity, or practical value of the thought's content

This dissociation occurs because:

- Phenomenological qualities (emotional resonance, felt profundity) arise from the experience of thinking, not from the content itself
- The brain's bias toward its own thoughts amplifies felt significance
- Context, mood, and mental state influence how thoughts feel, independent of their merit
- Novel associations can feel profound even when the resulting idea is trivial

Common manifestations:

- "Shower thoughts" that feel brilliant but are obvious when written
- Late-night insights that seem trivial in the morning
- Ideas that feel groundbreaking but are already well-established
- Arguments that feel compelling internally but have clear flaws when externalized

The practical implication: Felt significance should be treated as a signal to examine a thought more carefully (through writing or articulation), not as evidence of the thought's actual value. The feeling itself is real and valid, but it's about the experience of thinking, not the quality of what is thought.

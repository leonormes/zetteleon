## Breaking Projects Into Micro-Tasks Reduces ADHD Overwhelm

**Summary:** Decomposing large, complex projects into specific, actionable micro-tasks with clear milestones makes work more manageable for ADHD individuals and reduces initiation barriers.

**Details:** Large projects overwhelm the ADHD brain because their scope obscures the next concrete action. By creating lists of specific, achievable steps with defined milestones, the pathway forward becomes visible. This approach enables picking up where you left off more easily, as each micro-task represents a clear re-entry point. Focusing on completing one small task at a time generates momentum and provides frequent dopamine rewards, sustaining engagement across work sessions.

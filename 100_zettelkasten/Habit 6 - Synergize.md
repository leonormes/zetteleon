**Habit 6: Synergize** is the principle of creative cooperation. It is the habit of valuing differences and seeking out third alternatives. Synergy is the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts (1 + 1 = 3 or more).

Synergy is the culmination of the previous habits. It is the fruit of being proactive ([[Habit 1 - Be Proactive]]), having a clear vision ([[Habit 2 - Begin with the End in Mind]]), managing yourself effectively ([[Habit 3 - Put First Things First]]), seeking mutual benefit ([[Habit 4 - Think Win-Win]]), and communicating empathically ([[Habit 5 - Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood]]).

## Creating the Third Alternative

When you synergize, you are not just compromising (where 1 + 1 = 1.5). You are engaging in a creative process to find a solution that is better than what either party could have come up with alone. This requires a high level of trust and a genuine belief that valuing the differences in perspective can lead to new insights.

## ProdOS Integration

Within the [[03 - ProdOS (Productivity Operating System)]], synergy is encouraged during the creative phases of planning.

- The [[10 - The Review and Reflection Process]], specifically during the "Get Creative" phase of the Weekly Review, is a prime opportunity to look for synergistic opportunities. For example, combining a goal from a `Parent` role with a goal from a `Sharpen the Saw` role (like going for a bike ride with a child) creates a synergistic outcome.

Synergy is the habit that makes the Public Victory possible, but to sustain it, one must practice continuous renewal, which is the focus of [[Habit 7 - Sharpen the Saw]].

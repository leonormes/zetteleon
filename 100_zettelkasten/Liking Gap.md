## Liking Gap

**Summary:** The liking gap is the systematic bias where people consistently underestimate how much others like them following conversations and social interactions, believing they are less likable than observers actually perceive them to be.

**Details:**

- **Mechanism**: Heightened self-awareness during interactions makes us acutely conscious of our own awkwardness, mistakes, and anxiety—negative internal experiences that others don't perceive
- **Magnitude**: Studies show the gap is substantial and persistent; after conversations, people rate themselves less favorably than their conversation partners rate them
- **Asymmetry**: The effect is one-directional—we underestimate others' liking but accurately estimate or overestimate our own liking of them
- **Consequences**:
  - Reduced likelihood of follow-up contact or relationship deepening
  - Missed opportunities for collaboration and friendship
  - Unnecessary social anxiety and withdrawal
  - Self-fulfilling prophecy when hesitancy is interpreted as disinterest

**Why it persists:** Privileged access to internal discomfort; lack of direct feedback about others' positive impressions; negativity bias prioritizing potential social threats.

**Countermeasure:** Assume, as a baseline, that people like you more than you think—research supports this as a more accurate default than your subjective impression.

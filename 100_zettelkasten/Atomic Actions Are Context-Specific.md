## Atomic Actions Are Context-Specific

**Summary:** A key property of an atomic action is that it must be context-specific, meaning it is tied to a particular tool, location, or person required for its completion.

**Details:** This property ensures that an action is truly actionable by identifying the necessary environment or resources. For example, an action might require a computer (`@computer`), a specific location (`@office`), or interaction with another person (`@boss`).

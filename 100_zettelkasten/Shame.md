Shame is a deeply personal and painful emotion that stems from a negative self-evaluation. It is often associated with feelings of worthlessness, powerlessness, and a belief that one is inherently flawed or bad. Shame is an internal experience, meaning it's primarily about how you see yourself, rather than how others see you. It can lead to a desire to hide or withdraw.

Shame differs from related emotions like [[Humiliation]] (which involves external degradation) and [[Embarrasment]] (which focuses on specific social missteps). See [[What's the Difference Between Shame Humiliation and Embarrassment]] for detailed comparisons.

# Time Blocking is a Technique for Dedicating Specific Segments of Time to Particular Tasks

**Summary:** Time blocking (or time chunking) is a personal time management technique that involves dividing a day or week into smaller segments or "blocks" dedicated to specific tasks or to-dos.

**Details:** This method effectively merges a calendar with a to-do list, ensuring that every minute of the day is assigned a purpose. It is a proactive approach to scheduling that shifts focus from reactively addressing tasks as they arise to intentionally planning when to work on them.

**Summary:** An atomic action must possess four essential properties to be effective: it must be indivisible, physical and visible, have an unambiguous definition of done, and be context-specific.

**The Four Properties:**

**1. Indivisible (Atomic):**

An action cannot be broken down further while remaining meaningful. It is the smallest possible unit of work.

**Examples:**
- **Not Atomic:** "Write report" (can be broken down)
- **Atomic:** "Open new document and title it 'Q3 Report'"

**Not Atomic:** "Organize office" (too large)
- **Atomic:** "Sort papers on desk into three piles: keep, file, trash"

The test: Can this action be completed in a single, uninterrupted session without requiring a different context or waiting for external input?

**2. Physical & Visible:**

An action must be a real-world activity that produces an observable change. It must be something you *do* with your body and tools, not just think.

**Examples:**
- **Not Physical:** "Decide on strategy" (internal mental state)
- **Physical:** "Brainstorm strategy options on whiteboard for 15 minutes"
- **Not Physical:** "Think about email response"
- **Physical:** "Draft email reply to client and save in drafts"

The test: Would an observer be able to see you doing this action?

**3. Unambiguous Definition of Done:**

Completion must be binary (0 or 1) and instantly verifiable. There is no "partially done" or ambiguous completion state.

**Examples:**
- **Ambiguous:** "Make progress on presentation" (what constitutes progress?)
- **Unambiguous:** "Create slide deck with 5 blank slides titled with section names"
- **Ambiguous:** "Work on budget"
- **Unambiguous:** "Fill in Q3 revenue numbers in budget spreadsheet cells B15-B20"

The test: Can you definitively say "yes, this is complete" or "no, this is not complete" without any uncertainty?

**4. Context-Specific:**

An action is tied to a specific context—the tool, location, or person required to complete it. This enables context-based action lists.

**Examples:**
- `@computer`: "Update project status in Asana"
- `@phone`: "Call dentist to schedule appointment"
- `@office`: "Print quarterly reports"
- `@home`: "Organize pantry shelves"
- `@waiting_for`: "Response from John on budget approval"

The test: What specific tool, location, or person is required to complete this action?

**Why These Properties Matter:**

**For General Productivity:**
- **Clarity:** No ambiguity about what to do
- **Actionability:** Always clear what the next step is
- **Completion:** Provides satisfaction of definite progress
- **Organization:** Context tags enable efficient batching

**For ADHD:**
- **Reduces Overwhelm:** Small, clear actions are less daunting
- **Overcomes Initiation Resistance:** Physical, visible actions are easier to start
- **Provides Clarity:** Unambiguous completion removes uncertainty
- **Enables Context Switching:** Context tags help navigate when different tools/locations are available

**Violations and Fixes:**

| Violation | Example | Fix |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Too Large | "Plan marketing campaign" | "List 10 potential campaign themes in notebook" |
| Not Physical | "Consider options" | "Write pros/cons list for each option" |
| Ambiguous Done | "Improve documentation" | "Add code examples to API endpoints 1-5 in docs" |
| Missing Context | "Send email" | "@computer: Send status update email to team" |

**The Atomic Standard:**

If an action fails any of these four properties, it's not atomic and should be refined until it passes all four tests.

**Summary:** The difference between music as expression and music as a product is not a hard binary but a spectrum, and many artists move between these two worlds.

**Details:** An artist might start with a purely expressive work that later becomes commercially successful, or a commercial artist might create a deeply personal project. It is not a fixed state, and the line can be blurry. The key is to analyze the primary intention behind a work.

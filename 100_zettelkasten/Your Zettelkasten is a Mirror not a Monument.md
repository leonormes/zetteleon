title: Your Zettelkasten is a Mirror not a Monument

The focus of a Zettelkasten should not be on building a perfect, monumental system, but on the thinking itself. The system is a mirror that reflects your evolving mind; it doesn't have to be beautiful or correct—it just has to grow.

Let it be ugly and uneven. It is working if you’re capturing ideas and re-encountering them later with new insight. This connects to the idea that [[The Processing Is the Hard Part]] and that ultimately, [[You Are the Zettelkasten]].

For practical advice on how to start, see [[Getting Started with Zettelkasten with ADHD]].

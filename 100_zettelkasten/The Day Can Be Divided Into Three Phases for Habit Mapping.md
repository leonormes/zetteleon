title: The Day Can Be Divided Into Three Phases for Habit Mapping
type: concept
uid:

The day can be divided into three phases based on natural neurochemical fluctuations, and habits can be mapped to the phase where they are most likely to succeed:

- **Phase 1 (0-8 hours after waking):** High dopamine and cortisol. Best for high-friction, energy-expensive habits.
- **Phase 2 (9-14 hours after waking):** Lower dopamine, rising serotonin. Best for less effortful habits, journaling, and reflection.
- **Phase 3 (16-24 hours after waking):** Wind-down phase. Best for optimizing sleep and rest.

## Task Execution Consists of Five Distinct Cognitive Phases

**Summary:** Research identifies five sequential phases in task execution: initiation/activation, encoding/planning, execution/sustained attention, performance monitoring, and completion.

**Details:** Multiple cognitive models converge on this phase structure. The initiation phase involves organizing materials, estimating time, and generating enough energy to overcome inertia. The encoding/planning phase processes task demands and formulates an approach. The execution phase requires sustained attention and working memory during active performance. Performance monitoring involves continuously tracking progress and detecting errors. The completion phase includes finishing, checking work, and transitioning away. Each phase recruits different brain networks and cognitive resources, with distinct failure modes in conditions like ADHD.

**Phase Transition:** The ACT-R model specifies that processing time for perception-cognition-action cycles is approximately 260-390ms for simple tasks, though complex tasks involving memory retrieval take substantially longer.

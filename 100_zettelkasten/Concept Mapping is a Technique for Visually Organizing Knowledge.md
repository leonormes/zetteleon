## Concept Mapping is a Technique for Visually Organizing Knowledge

**Summary:** A concept map is a graphical tool for organizing and representing knowledge by visually depicting key concepts as nodes and the relationships between them as labeled lines.

**Details:** The process of creating a concept map promotes meaningful learning by forcing the learner to identify key ideas, discern relationships between them, and understand the overall structure of a topic. This active structuring makes connections explicit and helps create a more cohesive and integrated understanding.

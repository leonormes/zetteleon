Event-based scheduling structures minimize time-pressure anxiety and reduce the psychological burden of clock-watching by decoupling routines from specific times and instead tying them to completed activities or natural life events.

For individuals with ADHD, autism, or anxiety conditions, constantly monitoring the clock to meet rigid time-based deadlines creates persistent stress and can trigger executive function paralysis. Event-based structures eliminate this stressor—there's no need to anxiously check whether you're "on schedule" because the schedule flows from what you've completed, not what time it is.

This approach transforms time from a source of pressure into a flexible resource, allowing individuals to focus on task completion and natural rhythms rather than maintaining temporal precision.

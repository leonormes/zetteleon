## Body Doubling for ADHD Focus

Body doubling is a productivity strategy where a person with ADHD works on a task in the presence of another person. The "body double" is not necessarily helping with the task; their quiet presence is enough to improve focus and motivation.

### Core Concept

The presence of another person provides a gentle, external form of accountability and structure. It helps to anchor the ADHD brain, reducing the pull of distractions and making it easier to initiate and sustain effort.

### How It Works

- **In-Person**: Working in the same room as a friend, family member, or coworker.
- **Virtually**: Working with someone over a video call or even just a phone call.
- **Effectiveness**: It is effective for both introverts and extroverts, as the interaction can be minimal.

### Why It Works for ADHD

- **External Accountability**: The presence of another person creates a subtle social pressure to stay on task.
- **Reduces Distraction**: It helps to ground the individual in the present moment and reduces the likelihood of mind-wandering.
- **Provides Structure**: It creates a defined period of work, acting as an external support for executive functions.

### Connections

- It is a form of [[Environmental Design for ADHD Focus]], where the "environment" includes the social context.

### Digital and Asynchronous Body Doubling

A modern variation of this technique is the "Body Double Without the Body," where a camera or phone is pointed at the individual while they work. The sense of being observed, even if the footage is never reviewed, can be enough to boost initiation and focus. This method can also be used to capture task reminders and ideas as they occur, which can be transferred to a task management system later.

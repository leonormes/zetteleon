title: Unrealistic expectations are the main obstacle to building ADHD routines

The primary obstacle to building sustainable routines for individuals with ADHD is not inconsistency, but setting unrealistic expectations. Trying to change too much too quickly leads to overwhelm and failure, reinforcing a negative cycle. The key is to start with small, manageable changes.

This principle is sometimes called "one degree of change"—making incremental adjustments rather than attempting dramatic overnight transformations. When we push too far beyond our current capacity, we create unsustainable stress that leads to abandonment of the new behavior. Sustainable change happens at the boundary of the proximal zone of development, where growth feels challenging but achievable, not overwhelming.

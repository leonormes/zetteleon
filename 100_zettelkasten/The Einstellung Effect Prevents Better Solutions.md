The Einstellung Effect is a cognitive trap where a person's pre-existing mindset or the first solution that comes to mind prevents them from seeing better or more optimal solutions.

Because a particular mental model or problem-solving approach has worked in the past, an individual will apply it reflexively. They become fixated on the familiar solution, even when the context changes and a different approach would be superior.

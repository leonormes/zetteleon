## Intelligence is a Flexible Problem-Solving Toolbox

**Summary:** Intelligence is best understood not as a single measurable trait, but as a diverse set of flexible problem-solving skills that enable organisms to survive and adapt to their environments.

**Details:** This "toolbox" includes:
- Gathering and processing environmental information (senses, awareness)
- Memory to store and recall experiences
- Learning from past experiences
- Creativity to combine skills in novel ways
- Planning and strategy for future needs

Different species develop different combinations of these tools based on their ecological needs, resulting in specialized forms of intelligence.

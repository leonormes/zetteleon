Starter tasks are effective because they trigger a cognitive shift away from the overwhelming big picture and toward a manageable, immediate action. This bypasses two major psychological hurdles in ADHD: overthinking and perfectionism.

## How Starter Tasks Work

1.  **Builds Momentum:** In physics, an object in motion tends to stay in motion. The same applies to human behavior. A small, completed action creates momentum that makes it easier to transition into the next, slightly larger action.
2.  **Creates a Dopamine Hit:** Completing any task, no matter how small, provides a small release of dopamine. For the dopamine-deficient ADHD brain, this reward makes continuing the overall task more appealing.
3.  **Bypasses Overthinking:** A starter task is so small and simple (e.g., "Open a document") that there is nothing to overthink or plan. It short-circuits the analysis paralysis that often prevents a task from starting.
4.  **Reduces Perfectionism:** It is impossible to be a perfectionist about a binary action like "opening a file." The task is either done or not done. This removes the pressure of having to do the *entire* task perfectly from the outset.

## The Cognitive Shift

-   **Before Starter Task:** The brain is focused on the magnitude of the full task ("I have to write a whole report"). The primary question is, "*Should I start?*" which is often met with resistance.
-   **After Starter Task:** Having already engaged with the task materials, the brain's focus shifts. The question is no longer about starting, but "*What should I do next?*" This is a much less intimidating question to answer.

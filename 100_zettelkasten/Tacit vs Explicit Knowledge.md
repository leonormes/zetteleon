A team's operational model of a system can be viewed through the lens of tacit and explicit knowledge, often visualised as an iceberg.

- Explicit Knowledge (Tip of the iceberg): Documentation, diagrams, agreed-upon definitions. This is what the team sees and believes is shared.
- Tacit Knowledge (Hidden bulk): Individual instincts, unstated assumptions, and flawed mental models held by each team member.
  The most dangerous foundational flaws in a team's understanding often reside in this hidden, tacit layer. Making tacit knowledge explicit through practices like collaborative diagramming is crucial for building a genuinely shared model.

In contrast to the ADHD brain, the neurotypical brain operates on an "importance-based" model. While still responsive to interest, it can also initiate tasks based on abstract factors like responsibility, social expectations, or long-term benefits, even if the task itself is not engaging.

In contrast to the [[The Interest-Based Nervous System in ADHD]], neurotypical individuals often operate on an "importance-based nervous system." This system allows them to initiate and complete tasks because they are deemed important, regardless of whether they are inherently interesting.

Key drivers for this motivational system include:

- **Duty and Responsibility:** A sense of obligation or doing the "right thing."
- **Personal Significance:** Alignment with personal values.
- **External Expectations:** The pursuit of rewards (e.g., salary, recognition) or the avoidance of negative consequences (e.g., failure, punishment).
- **Long-Term Goals:** The ability to find motivation in consistent, incremental effort toward a future objective.

A key subjective experience for neurotypicals is receiving a "little shot of dopamine" upon task completion, which provides a feeling of pleasure and reinforces the behavior. This is a key point of divergence from the ADHD experience, as explored in [[The 'Dopamine Shot' vs 'Relief from Anxiety' in Task Completion]].

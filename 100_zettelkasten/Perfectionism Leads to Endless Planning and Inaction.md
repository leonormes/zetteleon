Perfectionism often manifests as over-planning and endless refinement, which are forms of motion that prevent action. The pursuit of the "perfect" approach becomes a significant barrier to starting.

This aligns with Voltaire's observation: **"The best is the enemy of the good."**

In an attempt to avoid mistakes or create an optimal plan, an individual can get stuck in a loop of analysis and preparation. This cycle of motion includes:

- Searching for the single best methodology.
- Refining a plan to account for every contingency.
- Delaying the start of a task until the conditions are perfect.

The desire for a flawless outcome paralyzes the will to act, as any real-world action will inevitably be imperfect. This makes the preparatory stage of motion a more attractive and less intimidating place to reside.

## Thoughts Feel More Profound in the Mind Due to the Illusion of Profundity

**Summary:** The "Illusion of Profundity" is the phenomenon where thoughts feel more significant, coherent, and insightful within the mind than they do when externalized in writing.

**Details:** This illusion is caused by several factors. Inside the mind, thoughts are amplified by emotions and exist in a non-linear, abstract form. Our internal monologue adds a dramatic narrative that is lost in writing. The act of formulating a thought can also feel like a creative accomplishment, inflating its perceived value. Writing strips these layers away, revealing the core idea in a more objective light.

title: Mini routines can attach to common activities as reset points

Mini routines can be attached to recurring common activities—such as meal breaks, rest periods, commute endings, or essential chores—transforming these regular touchpoints into "reset" opportunities that maintain momentum and structure throughout the day.

This attachment strategy leverages existing habits as triggers for new behavioral sequences. For example, finishing lunch becomes the cue for a brief rest routine, or completing a shower triggers a planning session. By linking new routines to activities that already happen consistently, you bypass the initiation challenge and create natural chains of productive behavior.

These activity-anchored routines provide regular opportunities to reorient attention, reassess energy levels, and adjust plans without requiring external reminders or willpower to remember when to implement them.

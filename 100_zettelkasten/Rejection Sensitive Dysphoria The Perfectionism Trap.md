title: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria The Perfectionism Trap

RSD amplifies overthinking by making every decision feel high-stakes:

- Fear of Making Wrong Choices: Spending excessive time researching to avoid potential criticism
- Replay Loops: Mentally rehearsing past failures or imagined future failures
- Analysis Paralysis: Using research as a way to delay potentially imperfect action

Key Insight: Your brain treats all thoughts as equally urgent due to impaired filtering. A minor configuration decision feels as critical as system architecture choices.

## Perfectionism as a Shield

For individuals with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), perfectionism and over-planning become a primary coping mechanism. The emotional pain of perceived failure is so extreme that the individual develops a compulsive need to account for every contingency and anticipate every potential criticism. This over-planning is a futile attempt to construct a perfect, invulnerable shield against the possibility of making a mistake. Because no plan can ever be truly perfect, this quest for certainty inevitably leads to paralysis, as it feels neurologically safer to do nothing than to risk the intense emotional fallout of a perceived failure.

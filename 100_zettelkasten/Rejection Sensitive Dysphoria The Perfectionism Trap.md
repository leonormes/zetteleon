RSD amplifies overthinking by making every decision feel high-stakes:

- Fear of Making Wrong Choices: Spending excessive time researching to avoid potential criticism
- Replay Loops: Mentally rehearsing past failures or imagined future failures
- Analysis Paralysis: Using research as a way to delay potentially imperfect action

Key Insight: Your brain treats all thoughts as equally urgent due to impaired filtering. A minor configuration decision feels as critical as system architecture choices.

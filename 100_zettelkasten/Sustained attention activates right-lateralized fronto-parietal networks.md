## Sustained Attention Activates Right-lateralized Fronto-parietal Networks

**Summary:** A predominantly right-lateralized network subserves sustained attention, including dorsomedial, midand ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, parietal areas (intraparietal sulcus, temporoparietal junction), and subcortical structures (cerebellar vermis, thalamus, putamen).

**Details:** Meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies identified this core network for vigilant attention maintenance. As sustained attention load increases, there is progressively increasing activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, striato-thalamic, parieto-temporal and cerebellar areas. During prolonged tasks, brain activity decreases in right dorsal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior parietal cortex over time, with compensatory increases in right caudate nucleus and posterior cingulate cortex. The right-lateralization reflects the right hemisphere's particular importance for regulating attention, behavior, and emotion.

**Clinical Significance:** This network shows characteristic dysfunction in ADHD, with reduced activation during sustained attention tasks and failure to properly deactivate the default mode network.

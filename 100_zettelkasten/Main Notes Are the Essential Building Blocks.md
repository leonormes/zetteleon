## Main Notes Are the Essential Building Blocks

**Summary:** Main notes (also called permanent or evergreen notes) are the final, essential building blocks of a Zettelkasten. They must be written in your own words using complete sentences to capture the crux of one single thought.

**Details:** Main notes represent the culmination of the Zettelkasten workflow—the durable knowledge created from processing fleeting and literature notes. Key characteristics define them: (1) they must be written in your own words, not copied from sources, (2) they use complete sentences to fully express ideas, (3) they embody one single idea per note (atomicity principle), (4) they are densely linked to existing notes in the network, and (5) they are concept-oriented rather than source-oriented. The process of translating ideas into your own words constitutes elaboration, which facilitates deeper understanding and long-term learning. This is not mere paraphrasing—it's actively thinking through the concept until you can express it independently. Main notes are "permanent" not because they never change, but because they become lasting parts of your knowledge network, continuing to accrue connections and value over time. They are the notes you actually work with, link between, and use to generate new insights and writing.

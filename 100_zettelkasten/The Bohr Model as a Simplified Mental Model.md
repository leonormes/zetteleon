The Bohr model of the atom, depicting electrons orbiting a nucleus like planets, is a common introductory mental model in chemistry. It is useful for explaining foundational concepts like energy shells.

However, the model is fundamentally incorrect. Electrons exist in probabilistic orbitals described by the Schrödinger equation, not in fixed orbits. Adhering strictly to the Bohr model prevents a deeper understanding of chemical bonding, molecular shapes, and quantum mechanics.

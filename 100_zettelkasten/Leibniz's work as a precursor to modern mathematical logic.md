The combined ambition of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's projects—the [[Characteristica Universalis (Leibniz)]] and the [[Calculus Ratiocinator (Leibniz)]]—is considered a direct intellectual precursor to the field of modern mathematical logic. His vision to formalise all knowledge into a symbolic language and then build a system to reason mechanically upon it laid the conceptual groundwork for later developments in logic, formal systems, and ultimately, computer science.

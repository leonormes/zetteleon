Over-preparation is a common form of motion used to delay action, particularly in situations where an individual might face failure or judgment.

By convincing oneself that more preparation is needed, one can indefinitely postpone the moment of performance or delivery. This cycle often involves:

- Endless research
- Excessive planning
- Constant strategizing

The preparation phase becomes a safe harbor, extended for as long as possible to avoid the risks inherent in action. While some preparation is necessary, over-preparation crosses a line into procrastination when its primary function is no longer to enable action, but to postpone it.

## Leaving a Task Intentionally Unfinished Creates a Clear Starting Point

**Summary:** By intentionally leaving a small, well-documented task unfinished at the end of a work session, you provide your future self with an obvious and easy place to begin.

**Details:** This technique, often called the "Hemingway method," removes the initial friction of deciding what to work on next. The task should be simple enough to be resumed quickly, acting as a low-effort entry point that helps rebuild momentum and re-establish the mental context of the project.

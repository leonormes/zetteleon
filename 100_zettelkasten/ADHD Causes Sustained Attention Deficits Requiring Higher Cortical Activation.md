title: ADHD Causes Sustained Attention Deficits Requiring Higher Cortical Activation

Individuals with ADHD exhibit significant deficits in sustained, selective, and divided attention. They often have lower resting-state arousal but require greater and more continuous cortical activation than neurotypical individuals to maintain attention during a task. This is compounded by reduced activation in key striato-thalamic and prefrontal regions and difficulty deactivating the default mode network.

## External Accountability Sustains ADHD Project Commitment

**Summary:** Sharing project goals with others and establishing regular check-ins creates external motivation that helps ADHD individuals maintain commitment to long-term projects.

**Details:** External accountability leverages social motivation and urgency—two powerful drivers for the ADHD brain. By sharing goals with a friend, mentor, or accountability partner, and scheduling regular progress discussions, the project gains external structure and stakes. This creates a form of urgency (the upcoming check-in) and novelty (discussing progress with someone), both of which help sustain engagement. Joining creative groups or finding dedicated accountability partners makes this support ongoing and systematic rather than sporadic.

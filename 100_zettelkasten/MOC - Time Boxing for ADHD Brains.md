## MOC - Time Boxing for ADHD Brains

> **Inclusion criteria:** Strategies and concepts specific to time boxing for ADHD individuals; must address neurodivergent challenges.

### Core Concept: What Time Boxing Is

**Time boxing** is allocating a fixed, pre-determined amount of time to a task, then stopping when time is up—regardless of completion status. This technique is especially powerful for ADHD brains, which struggle with time perception and task boundaries.

### The Mindset Shift

#### Focus on Process, Not Completion

[[Focus on Process Not Completion to Reduce ADHD Overwhelm]] rel:: foundational-mindset

For ADHD individuals, the thought of "completing" large tasks triggers overwhelming avoidance. Time boxing shifts success criteria: if you work for the allocated time, you've succeeded. This reframe transforms impossible-feeling tasks into manageable time commitments.

#### Progress Over Perfection

**"Done is better than perfect"** is the mantra. Time boxing enforces this by creating hard stops. When the timer ends, you assess and move forward—preventing perfectionism paralysis.

### Before You Start: Task Preparation

#### Break Down Large Tasks

[[Breaking Projects Into Micro-Tasks Reduces ADHD Overwhelm]] rel:: prerequisite-strategy

Don't time box "work on report"—that's too vague. Instead:

- "Draft introduction for report"
- "Research statistics for section 2"  
- "Outline main arguments"

#### Define "Done" for Each Box

[[The Done State as a Boundary for ADHD Projects]] rel:: prerequisite-strategy

Before starting a time box, define what "done" looks like for *that specific box*:

- "Write at least three paragraphs"
- "Get main points down, even if rough"
- "Clear all dishes into dishwasher"

This creates achievable success criteria and prevents scope creep.

### Setting Up Your Time Box

#### Choose Your Duration

**Start short and build up:**
- **Pomodoro Standard:** 25 minutes work + 5 minute break
- **ADHD-Adapted:** Start with 10-15 minutes if 25 feels too long
- **Be honest:** How long can you realistically focus?
- **Better to underestimate** than feel defeated by overcommitting

#### Use Visual Timers

[[Visual Timers for ADHD Time Blindness]] rel:: essential-tool

Visual timers make abstract time concrete:

- Use physical timer, app, or online tool
- Graphic display (disappearing wedge, progress bar)
- Keep timer visible during work
- Creates gentle urgency that motivates ADHD brains

### During the Time Box

#### Minimize Distractions

[[Environmental Design for ADHD Focus]] rel:: supporting-strategy

[[Distraction Management in Timeboxing (Catch-All List)]] rel:: specific-technique

- Turn off notifications
- Close unnecessary tabs/apps
- Use noise-cancelling headphones
- Keep "catch-all list" for intrusive thoughts—jot and return to task

#### Work Until Timer Rings

**The "No Matter What" rule:**
- Commit to working *only* on that specific task
- If you finish early: take extra break or assess next step
- **If timer rings before finishing: STOP.** This is crucial—you succeeded by working the time

#### Managing Hyperfocus

[[Managing Hyperfocus in ADHD with Timeboxing]] rel:: specific-challenge

Timer serves as external cue to break hyperfocus on low-priority tasks, prompting conscious decision to continue or redirect.

### After the Time Box

#### Take Mandatory Breaks

Breaks are **non-negotiable** for ADHD brains:

- **Standard:** 5 minutes after 25-minute box
- **Longer:** 15-30 minutes after four boxes
- **Real breaks:** Move, hydrate, look outside—not social media scrolling

#### Review and Adjust

After each box or break:

1. **Acknowledge what you did** (even if not "everything")
2. **Assess the task:** Done? What's next small step?
3. **Assess time estimate:** Too long? Too short? Adjust for next time

This is a learning process—calibrating your time perception.

### ADHD-Specific Support Strategies

#### External Accountability

[[Body Doubling for ADHD Focus]] rel:: support-strategy

Work in presence of another person (in-person or virtually). Their quiet presence improves focus and motivation through gentle accountability.

[[External Accountability Sustains ADHD Project Commitment]] rel:: support-strategy

Share time boxing goals with accountability partner or join online body doubling communities.

#### Sensory and Environmental Support

- **Fidget tools:** Use if sensory input helps focus
- **Change locations:** Novel environment provides dopamine boost
- **Physical removal of distractions:** Move phone out of sight

#### Gamification and Rewards

- **Make it a game:** "How many words in this sprint?"
- **Track streaks:** Visual progress motivates
- **Reward completion:** Small, healthy rewards after successful boxes

#### Externalize Everything

[[Visual Schedules Make Routines Tangible]] rel:: support-strategy

- Write tasks down—don't rely on memory
- Use colors, sticky notes, visual boards
- Make time boxes visible on calendar

### Integration With Other Frameworks

Time boxing works synergistically with:

- [[MOC - The One Degree Change Framework for ADHD]] rel:: complementary → Start with one 10-minute box
- [[MOC - Day Architecture for Peak Performance]] rel:: complementary → Schedule boxes during energy peaks
- [[MOC - ADHD Routine Building Strategies]] rel:: complementary → Build time boxing habit gradually

### Practical Example: Kitchen Cleaning

**Without time boxing (ADHD nightmare):**
- Face entire messy kitchen
- Get overwhelmed by scope
- Start one thing, get distracted
- Hours later: still messy, feel defeated

**With time boxing (manageable):**

1. **Break down:**
   - Clear and wash dishes
   - Wipe counters
   - Clean sink
   - Sweep floor

2. **Time Box 1 (20 min):** "Clear and wash dishes"
   - Define "Done": All dishes in dishwasher or drying rack
   - Set timer, work ONLY on dishes
   - Timer rings—maybe 80% done—that's 80% more than before! Success.
   - Take break

3. **Time Box 2 (15 min):** "Wipe counters"
   - Define "Done": All main surfaces clear and wiped
   - Work, stop, break

Result: Clear measurable progress, better time perception, no defeat

### Getting Started Protocol

#### Today: Your First Time Box

1. **Pick ONE small, specific task**
2. **Set timer for 10-15 minutes** (start conservative)
3. **Define "done" for this box**
4. **Minimize distractions**
5. **Work until timer rings**
6. **Stop and acknowledge success**

That's it. You can build from there.

### Key Principles

- **Process = Success:** Working the time is the goal
- **Stop when timer rings:** Even if not "finished"
- **Breaks are mandatory:** Not optional
- **Start small:** 10-15 minutes is valid
- **Be kind:** Some days are harder—adjust accordingly
- **One box > zero boxes:** On hard days, one 10-minute box is a win

### Why This Works for ADHD

- **Makes time tangible:** Visual timers overcome time blindness
- **Reduces overwhelm:** Small time commitments feel manageable
- **Creates urgency:** Gentle deadline activates interest-based nervous system
- **Prevents perfectionism:** Hard stops force progress over perfection
- **Builds time perception:** Calibrates internal sense of duration
- **Provides structure:** External framework supports executive function

## Memory Enables Learning by Storing Experiences for Future Use

**Summary:** Memory is a fundamental cognitive tool that allows organisms to store information from past experiences and apply it to future situations, forming the basis of learning.

**Details:** Memory works by:
- Recording sensory inputs and experiences
- Storing this information in a retrievable format
- Allowing recall when similar situations are encountered

Even simple organisms like slime molds exhibit memory-like behavior by avoiding their own trails after exploring a maze, demonstrating that memory exists on a spectrum across species. In humans, memory enables complex learning by building connections between past and present experiences.

## Pragmatism Defines Truth by Practical Consequences

**Summary:** Pragmatism, an American philosophical tradition developed by figures like William James and John Dewey, argues that the truth, meaning, or value of an idea is defined by its practical consequences.

**Details:** According to the pragmatic maxim, an idea's meaning is the sum of its practical effects. Theories are seen as instruments rather than answers to abstract enigmas. In this view, knowledge that does not lead to a change in action or experience is largely useless and meaningless. Truth is what "works" in practice.

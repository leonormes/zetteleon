title: Sustained Attention Relies on a Right-Lateralized Prefrontal-Parietal Network
type: concept

Sustained attention is primarily managed by a right-lateralized brain network. This network includes the dorsomedial, midand ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, parietal areas, and subcortical structures like the thalamus and putamen. As the demand for sustained attention increases, activation in these areas also increases.

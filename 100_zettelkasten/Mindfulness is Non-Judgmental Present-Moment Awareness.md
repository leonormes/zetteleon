## Mindfulness is Non-Judgmental Present-Moment Awareness

**Summary:** Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment without judgment.

**Details:** This practice can be applied to any activity, from formal meditation to daily routines. It involves fully experiencing whatever is happening right now—thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and external stimuli—without getting lost in stories, interpretations, or analysis. It is a state of direct, non-conceptual awareness.

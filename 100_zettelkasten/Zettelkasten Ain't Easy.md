These workflows, GTD and Zettelkasten, have put me in a lazy mode and tricked me into seeing this process as easy. But effort is required.

Despite initial appearance, Zettelkasten is not easy. It is a system that offers tools that facilitate broad thinking. The job of thinking and learning is not easy. The results are of course coveted. Because of our parsimonious brains we take this system as if it were a shortcut to success. But it is a way of neatly and tidly putting that difficult work right in front of us; here you go, no more talk or showboating if you want this, think.

My mind is especially greedy when collecting ideas. I don't want to miss a thing. When a book is interesting and dense with ideas I want to capture it all. But that is just the book repeated. I should aim to capture just 1 idea and process it properly rather than get frozen in indecisive panic.

## Ambiguity in Social Cues

**Summary:** Social cues—facial expressions, body language, vocal tone—are inherently ambiguous signals that can arise from multiple causes; this ambiguity is the primary source of social misperception and creates space for biases to operate.

**Details:**

- **Multi-causal nature**: A single behavior (e.g., crossed arms) can indicate:
  - Defensiveness or disagreement
  - Physical cold
  - Habitual comfortable posture
  - Cultural communication norm
  - Self-soothing under cognitive load
- **Context dependence**: The same facial expression means different things in different contexts (a smile at a funeral vs. a party)
- **Individual variation**: Introverts, extroverts, and neurodivergent individuals signal engagement differently; baseline facial expressions vary widely
- **Noise in the channel**: Fatigue, illness, distraction, and multitasking all produce signals that mimic disinterest or negative affect

**Why ambiguity amplifies errors:**

- When cues are ambiguous, interpretation fills the gap—biases ([[Confirmation Bias Distorts Social Perception]], [[Fundamental Attribution Error]]) determine which explanation is selected
- Insecurity biases toward negative interpretations; confidence biases toward positive
- Without disambiguation, initial interpretations harden into false certainties

**Disambiguation tactics:**

- **Generate multiple explanations**: "Crossed arms could mean A, B, or C"
- **Seek converging evidence**: Don't rely on a single cue; look for patterns across multiple channels
- **Test assumptions**: If appropriate, ask directly rather than inferring
- **Adjust for base rates**: Most people aren't thinking about you most of the time; default to neutral rather than extreme interpretations

**Interaction with pattern recognition:** [[Pattern Recognition in Social Cognition]] relies on quick template matching, which works well for clear signals but fails catastrophically with ambiguous ones.

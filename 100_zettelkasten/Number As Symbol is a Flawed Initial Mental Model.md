title: Number As Symbol is a Flawed Initial Mental Model

The common assumption that numbers are the symbols used to write them (e.g., '7') is a foundational mental model. It is an [[Effective Theory]] for counting and basic arithmetic with integers.

However, this model is a [[Leaky Abstractions|leaky abstraction]] that breaks down completely when trying to comprehend:

- **Irrational Numbers**: A number like $\pi$ has an infinite, non-repeating decimal representation, impossible to fully "write down". Its true nature is a geometric ratio.
- **Infinity**: The concept of Infinity as a Property of Endlessness cannot be captured by a symbol representing a final quantity.
- **The Continuum**: The idea that between any two points there is another is lost in the discrete model of symbols.

Upgrading this model to the Number Line as a Continuous Model is necessary for deeper mathematical understanding, a clear example of [[Breaking Free from Flawed Models]].

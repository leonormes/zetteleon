**Summary:** During sustained attention tasks, healthy controls show progressive deactivation of the default mode network (particularly the precuneus) as attention load increases, but ADHD individuals fail to show this deactivation pattern, indicating problems with task-appropriate network suppression.

**Details:** fMRI studies reveal that ADHD individuals have significantly reduced activation in bilateral striato-thalamic regions, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and superior parietal cortex during sustained attention tasks. Critically, they display significantly increased precuneus activation compared to controls. The precuneus is negatively correlated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in healthy controls, showing progressive deactivation with increasing attention load. This deactivation pattern is absent in ADHD, suggesting the brain cannot properly suppress the default mode network that handles mind-wandering and internal mentation.

**Clinical Relevance:** This failure explains the characteristic "daydreaming" and mind-wandering symptoms in ADHD, as the brain cannot appropriately shift from internally-focused to externally-focused attention states.

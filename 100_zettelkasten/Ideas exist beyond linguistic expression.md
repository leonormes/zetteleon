## Ideas Exist beyond Linguistic Expression

**Summary:** Ideas and mental concepts exist as internal representations that precede and transcend their expression in any particular language or symbolic system.

**Details:** The phenomenon of having an "aha!" moment before being able to articulate it precisely suggests ideas precede verbal expression. The ability to express the same concept across different languages or recognize equivalent formulations demonstrates that the underlying idea is independent of specific linguistic structures. This points to mental representations or schemas that exist prior to and separate from language.

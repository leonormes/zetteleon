## MOC - Cognitive Abstraction and Understanding

This map organizes concepts about how abstraction levels affect understanding and knowledge representation.

### Core Concepts
- [[Higher Abstraction Levels Increase Breadth But Reduce Depth]] rel:: defines
- [[The Ladder of Abstraction Models Conceptual Granularity]] rel:: implements
- [[Understanding Compresses Information into Cognitive Chunks]] rel:: explains

### Frameworks
- [[SOLO Taxonomy Describes Understanding Levels]] rel:: measures

### Illustrations
- [[Map Analogy Illustrates Abstraction Tradeoffs]] rel:: demonstrates

### Comparisons
- [[Comparison - Knowing vs Understanding]] rel:: contrasts

### Visualization
### Cross-Domain Diagrams
- [[Diagram - Philosophy-Productivity Connections]]

### Application
1. Match abstraction level to task needs
2. Build from concrete to abstract
3. Use compression to manage cognitive load

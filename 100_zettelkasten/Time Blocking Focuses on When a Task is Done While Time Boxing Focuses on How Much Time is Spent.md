# Time Blocking Focuses on When a Task is Done While Time Boxing Focuses on How Much Time is Spent

| Criterion | Time Blocking | Time Boxing |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary Focus** | *When* tasks are done; scheduling specific time slots. | *How much time* is spent on a task; limiting duration. |
| **Scope** | Broader; often maps out entire days or weeks. | More granular; focuses on individual task durations. |
| **Flexibility** | Can accommodate work expansion within a block. | Actively prevents work expansion by capping time. |
| **Primary Goal** | To ensure dedicated time is allocated for all important activities. | To complete a task or sub-goal within a fixed time limit. |

**Context:** Time blocking is about structuring your schedule, while time boxing is about structuring your effort within that schedule. They are highly synergistic.

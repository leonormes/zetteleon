## Systems Are the Processes that Drive Progress

**Summary:** Systems are the repeatable processes and daily habits that lead to desired results, making them the most effective drivers of long-term progress.

**Details:** While goals define the target, systems are what actually move you toward it. Success is considered the product of consistent daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. Therefore, to achieve better outcomes, the most effective strategy is to focus on designing and refining the system rather than fixating on the goal itself.

## Meta-Accuracy in Social Perception

**Summary:** Meta-accuracy refers to the correspondence between how you believe others perceive you (meta-perceptions) and how they actually perceive you—a critical dimension of social self-awareness.

**Details:**

- **Definition**: Meta-accuracy = correlation between "how I think others see me" and "how others actually see me" across traits, behaviors, or specific interactions
- **Typical accuracy**: Research shows people achieve moderate meta-accuracy (~r=0.3-0.5), better than chance but far from perfect; accuracy improves with relationship closeness and observable traits
- **Determinants**:
  - Observable cues available (easier for dominance/extraversion than intelligence/anxiety)
  - Relationship duration and quality (friends > strangers)
  - Trait type (concrete behaviors > internal states)
  - Individual "good metaperceiver" skill (some people are consistently better)
- **Measurement approaches**:
  - Correlational: Do your beliefs correlate with others' ratings?
  - Mean-level: Do you systematically over/underestimate how you're seen?

**Why it matters:**

- High meta-accuracy enables social calibration, reputation management, and adaptive self-presentation
- Low meta-accuracy leads to social surprises, strained relationships, and misalignment between intended and perceived impact
- Awareness of limited meta-accuracy prevents overconfidence in social judgments

**Biases affecting meta-accuracy:** [[Spotlight Effect]] (overestimate noticing), [[Liking Gap]] (underestimate likability), egocentrism (assume others share your self-view).

## Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) is a Key Cellular Mechanism for Learning

**Summary:** Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) is a key cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory, referring to a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission between two neurons that results from repeatedly stimulating them synchronously.

**Details:** In essence, "neurons that fire together, wire together." Effortful cognitive engagement, such as that prompted by active learning strategies, is a potent trigger for LTP at relevant synapses, physically strengthening the neural pathways associated with a memory.

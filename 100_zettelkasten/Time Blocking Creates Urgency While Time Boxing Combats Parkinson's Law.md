# Time Blocking Creates Urgency While Time Boxing Combats Parkinson's Law

**Summary:** Time blocking and time boxing tap into powerful psychological drivers by creating artificial urgency and actively combating Parkinson's Law.

**Details:**
- **Time Blocking** fosters a sense of "artificial urgency" by setting deadlines for each block, which can enhance motivation and reduce decision fatigue.
- **Time Boxing** directly confronts Parkinson's Law—the idea that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. By imposing a cap on time, it forces efficiency and acts as a powerful antidote to perfectionism, encouraging completion over endless refinement.

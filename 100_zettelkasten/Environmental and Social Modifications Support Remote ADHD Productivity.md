## Environmental and Social Modifications Support Remote ADHD Productivity

**Summary:** Creating a structured physical and social environment is essential for remote developers with ADHD to maintain focus and productivity.

**Details:** This includes establishing a dedicated, quiet workspace to create a mental separation between work and personal life. Using noise-canceling headphones and setting firm boundaries with household members minimizes interruptions. Building consistent daily routines with fixed start/end times and scheduled breaks reduces decision fatigue. Prioritizing self-care, including exercise, nutrition, and sleep, is a necessity for managing ADHD symptoms effectively.

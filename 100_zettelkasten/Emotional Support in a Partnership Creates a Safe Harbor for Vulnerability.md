## Emotional Support in a Partnership Creates a Safe Harbor for Vulnerability

**Summary:** A key expectation in a healthy relationship is for a partner to be a source of emotional support, acting as a "safe harbor" for vulnerability, an advocate, and a source of empathy.

**Details:** This means being able to be vulnerable without fear of judgment, having a partner who has your back in private and public, and who makes a genuine effort to understand and care about your emotional state.

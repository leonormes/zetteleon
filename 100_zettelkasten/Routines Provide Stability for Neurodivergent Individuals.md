Routines provide essential stability and predictability for autistic and ADHD individuals, serving as a powerful tool to mitigate common challenges like anxiety, sensory overwhelm, and decision fatigue.

By creating a structured and predictable framework for daily life, routines reduce the number of novel situations that must be processed, thereby conserving mental and emotional energy. This conserved energy can then be allocated to other tasks, improving overall daily functioning, mood regulation, and stress management. The sense of control that a well-designed routine offers can be a grounding force in a world that often feels chaotic and unpredictable.

## Values Serve as Navigational Compass in Absence of Absolute Truth

**Summary:** When facts are provisional, values provide directional coherence, acting like a compass that helps pick bearings and evaluate trade-offs.

**Details:** When facts are provisional and contested, values provide directional coherence for decisions over time. Chosen values act like a compass: they do not eliminate uncertainty, but they help you pick a bearing, evaluate trade-offs, and stay oriented during course corrections. Articulating a small set of operational values translates into priorities, heuristics, and default choices. This enables purposeful action without pretending to certainty.

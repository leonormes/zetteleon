title: "The Meaning of a System's Logic is Relative to Perspective"

The logic and values that [[Systems Generate Internal Logic in Isolation|a system generates in isolation]] create a profound perceptual dichotomy.

- **Internal View:** For an observer *inside* the system, its rules and goals are all-consuming. They constitute reality itself and hold ultimate importance.
- **External View:** For an observer *outside* the system, who can see the broader context, that same logic and importance can appear arbitrary, trivial, or even nonsensical.

The meaning is not inherent in the system, but is a product of the observer's position relative to it. This highlights the difference between Subjectivity vs Objectivity and is the foundation for Paradigm Shif|paradigm shifts, where an observer moves from an internal to an external viewpoint, suddenly seeing the system in a new light.

This concept is the final piece of the puzzle that begins with [[Systems are Blind to Their Broader Context]].

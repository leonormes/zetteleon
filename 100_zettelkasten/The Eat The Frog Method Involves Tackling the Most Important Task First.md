# The Eat The Frog Method Involves Tackling the Most Important Task First

**Summary:** The "Eat The Frog" method, popularized by Brian Tracy, is a productivity strategy that advises identifying the most important and challenging task of the day (the "frog") and completing it first thing in the morning.

**Details:** This approach is designed to overcome procrastination on high-impact tasks. By tackling the "ugliest" task first, you ensure it gets done with peak energy and build a sense of accomplishment and momentum for the rest of the day. It inherently uses time blocking by reserving the morning for this single, critical task.

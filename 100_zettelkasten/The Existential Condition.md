When an emergent, [[Autopoiesis The Self-Referential System|autopoietic]] process produces a being with self-awareness, it leads directly to the existential condition. This condition is defined by a conflict between our innate drive to find meaning and the universe's apparent lack of any inherent purpose.

Key concepts defining this condition include:

- **Existence Precedes Essence:** A term coined by Jean-Paul Sartre, it means that we are born without a pre-ordained purpose. We simply *exist* first. Then, through our agency, we create our own essence or meaning.
- **The Absurd:** A concept from Albert Camus, describing the conflict between the human tendency to seek meaning and significance, and the silent, meaningless universe that offers none.

**Philosophical Roots:**
- [[Existentialism - Existence Precedes Essence]]
- [[Absurdism as Rebellion Against Meaninglessness]]
- Human condition as defined by radical freedom

This condition is a key part of the [[The Fractal Model of Self-Referential Meaning]] and is discussed in [[Contextual Myopia and Human Behavior]].

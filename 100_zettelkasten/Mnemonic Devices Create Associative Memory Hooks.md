## Mnemonic Devices Create Associative Memory Hooks

**Summary:** Mnemonics are memory aids that create strong associations between new information and existing knowledge through techniques like acronyms, rhymes, or vivid imagery.

**Common types:**
- **Acronyms**: ROYGBIV for rainbow colors
- **Rhymes**: "Thirty days hath September..."
- **Alliteration**: "Richard of York gave battle in vain" (rainbow colors)
- **Visual imagery**: Associating a person's name with a striking visual feature

**Why they work:**
- Create multiple retrieval paths for the same information
- Leverage the brain's natural tendency to remember unusual or emotional content
- Transform abstract information into concrete, memorable forms

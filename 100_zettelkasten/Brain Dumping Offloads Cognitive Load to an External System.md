## Brain Dumping Offloads Cognitive Load to an External System

**What:** A strategy to counteract the cognitive load from working memory deficits by transferring all thoughts, tasks, and worries from the mind to a trusted external system.

**How:**
1.  Select a single, trusted external system (e.g., notebook, whiteboard, digital app).
2.  Schedule a recurring, non-negotiable 15-minute "brain dump" session.
3.  During the session, write down *everything* occupying mental space without filtering or organizing.
4.  *After* the dump is complete, sort the items into relevant categories (e.g., project board, calendar, someday/maybe list).

**Failure modes:**
-   Trying to organize *during* the brain dump, which adds friction and defeats the purpose of offloading.
-   Using multiple, untrusted systems, which creates anxiety about losing information.

**Example (1 max):** At the end of the workday, spend 15 minutes writing every open loop onto a whiteboard: "email Bob," "buy milk," "idea for new feature," "worry about deadline." Then, move each item to its proper place (calendar, task list, etc.). The primary goal is to offload the burden of remembering.

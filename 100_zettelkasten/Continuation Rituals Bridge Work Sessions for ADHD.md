## Continuation Rituals Bridge Work Sessions for ADHD

**Summary:** A brief ritual performed at the end of each work session—summarizing accomplishments, noting next steps, and visualizing future re-entry—creates mental continuity and eases project resumption.

**Details:** The ADHD challenge of losing mental models between work sessions can be addressed by establishing a short closing ritual. This involves: (1) summarizing what was accomplished, which reinforces progress and creates closure; (2) explicitly noting the next 1-3 concrete actions, which provides a clear re-entry point; and (3) briefly visualizing where and how you'll pick up in the next session, which primes the brain for continuation. This ritual externalizes the mental model before it dissipates, serving as a bridge across the gap between sessions.

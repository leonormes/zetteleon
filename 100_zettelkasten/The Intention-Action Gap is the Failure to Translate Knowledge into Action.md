## The Intention-Action Gap is the Failure to Translate Knowledge into Action

**Summary:** The "intention-action gap" (or "knowing-doing gap") is the common and well-documented failure to translate stated values, intentions, or knowledge into corresponding actions.

**Details:** Research shows this gap can be as high as 40%, meaning a significant portion of what we intend to do never materializes. This is not simply a failure of willpower but a complex phenomenon with cognitive, motivational, and contextual causes. It explains why people often know what is good for them (e.g., exercise, saving money) but fail to act on that knowledge.

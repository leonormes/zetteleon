title: The Myth of Sisyphus as an Absurd Hero

Albert Camus uses the Greek myth of Sisyphus to illustrate his concept of the Absurd Hero. Sisyphus was condemned by the gods to forever roll a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down each time he neared the top. This is a metaphor for the Absurd life: a futile, hopeless, and repetitive labor.

According to Camus, Sisyphus becomes the Absurd Hero at the moment he recognizes the full futility of his task. He does not hope for it to end. He knows the boulder will roll down. His [[Camus's Three Responses to the Absurd|revolt]] is in the act of walking back down the mountain to push it again, fully conscious of his fate, yet choosing to continue.

Camus famously concludes, **"One must imagine Sisyphus happy."** His happiness comes not from delusion or hope, but from scornfully embracing his tragic condition and finding his purpose in the struggle itself. His act of pushing the boulder is an act of rebellion against the meaningless fate imposed upon him.

This concept is derived from the broader conversation in [[Contextual Myopia and Human Behavior]].

# Modern Productivity Systems Formalize Implicit Historical Strategies

**Summary:** Modern productivity systems like GTD and Atomic Habits essentially describe, formalize, and democratize the implicit strategies that have always enabled human achievement.

**Details:** These systems document the "how" of productivity so it can be replicated, scaled, and adapted. They are particularly useful in solving modern dilemmas like information overload and constant distraction, which have weakened traditional, informal structures.

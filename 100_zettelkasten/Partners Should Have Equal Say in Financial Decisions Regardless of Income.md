# Partners Should Have Equal Say in Financial Decisions Regardless of Income

**Summary:** It is reasonable for partners to expect an equal (50/50) say on all major financial decisions and goal-setting, because all money is considered "family money."

**Details:** A partner's "say" in financial matters is not a vote weighted by their income. As full partners in the family unit, both individuals should have an equal voice in defining shared goals and making significant financial choices.

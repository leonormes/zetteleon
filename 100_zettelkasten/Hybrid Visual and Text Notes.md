Zsolt Viczián's method advocates for a "sketch first, then explain" approach, creating a hybrid note that balances visual structure with textual detail.

A hybrid note consists of:

- A **visual section** (the Excalidraw canvas) for the structure, relationships, and overall map of an idea.
- A **text section** (the linked `.md` file) for detailed explanations, sources, and context.

This approach connects the visual-spatial model with deep, reasoned-out knowledge.

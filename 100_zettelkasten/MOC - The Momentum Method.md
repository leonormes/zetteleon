This map outlines the **Momentum Method**, a strategy for overcoming the neurological barrier to starting tasks, a common challenge in ADHD. The method focuses on engineering tasks to lower their initial activation energy, making it easier to begin.

## The Core Problem

The primary obstacle is not the task itself, but the mental energy required to start.

- [[Activation Energy is the Primary Barrier to ADHD Task Initiation]]

## The Solution & Its Components

The method uses specially designed micro-tasks to build momentum.

- **The Method**: [[The Momentum Method Uses Starter Tasks to Lower Activation Energy]]
- **The Tool**: [[A Starter Task is a Small Action Designed Purely to Build Momentum]]

## The Underlying Psychology

Starter tasks are effective because they shift cognitive focus and bypass common psychological hurdles.

- [[Starter Tasks Bypass Overthinking and Reduce Perfectionism]]
- [[The Zeigarnik Effect Creates a Cognitive Pull Towards Task Completion]]

## Advanced Application

For particularly difficult tasks, the method can be extended.

## For ADHD The Clarification Process Externalizes Decision-Making and Builds System Trust

**Summary:** For individuals with ADHD, the clarification process externalizes decision-making, prevents paralysis by providing clear next steps, and builds system trust through consistent actionability.

**Details:** This process ensures that clarification happens once, rather than repeatedly in the moment of execution, which can be a significant challenge for executive function. By consistently delivering actionable items and preventing vague "stuff" from causing paralysis, the system becomes a reliable and trusted support.

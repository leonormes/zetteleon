# Time Boxing is a Goal-Oriented Strategy Where a Fixed Period is Allocated to a Specific Task

**Summary:** Time boxing is a goal-oriented time management strategy where a fixed, predetermined period—a "timebox"—is allocated to a specific task, during which all effort is concentrated solely on that task.

**Details:** A crucial aspect of time boxing is that work on the task typically stops when the timebox ends, regardless of completion. This imposition of a clear endpoint is particularly effective for combating perfectionism and procrastination.

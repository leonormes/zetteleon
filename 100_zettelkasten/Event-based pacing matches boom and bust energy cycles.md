title: Event-based pacing matches boom and bust energy cycles

Event-based pacing systems can match the natural "boom and bust" energy cycles common in ADHD and autism by allowing high-energy periods to run longer and low-energy periods to compress or rest, rather than forcing all activities into predetermined time blocks.

"Boom and bust" refers to the oscillating pattern where individuals experience periods of high capability and intense productivity followed by periods of depletion and reduced functioning. Time-based schedules often fail because they assume consistent energy availability throughout the day and week.

By using event completion rather than clock time as transition markers, mini routines accommodate this variability: a high-energy morning might flow through multiple productive blocks before lunch, while a low-energy morning might consolidate to essential tasks only. The structure persists while the intensity adapts to actual capacity.

**Definition:** Algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies abstract structures defined by operations and their properties, generalizing the rules of arithmetic through the use of symbols and variables.

**Foundational Pattern:** Rather than studying patterns of things (numbers, shapes), algebra studies patterns of actions or processes—the rules of symmetry, transformation, and combination.

**Key Structures:**
- **Groups:** Study of symmetry operations
- **Rings:** Generalization of integer arithmetic
- **Fields:** Structures with both addition and multiplication (like rational or real numbers)
- **Vector spaces:** Foundation for linear algebra

**Example:** Instead of computing 2 + 3 = 5, algebra works with general equations like x + y = z, allowing reasoning about all possible instances simultaneously.

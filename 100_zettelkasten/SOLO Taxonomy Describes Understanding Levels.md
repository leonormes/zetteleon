## SOLO Taxonomy Describes Understanding Levels

**Summary:** The Structure of Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy categorizes understanding into five increasing complexity levels.

**Levels:**
1. Pre-structural: Missing the point
2. Uni-structural: Single relevant aspect
3. Multi-structural: Multiple unconnected facts
4. Relational: Integrated knowledge
5. Extended abstract: Transferable principles

**Application:**
- Assess learning depth
- Design curriculum progression

## Dual Coding Theory Suggests Using Verbal and Visual Channels Enhances Memory

**Summary:** Allan Paivio's Dual Coding Theory posits that human cognition operates with two distinct but interconnected systems for processing information: a verbal system (for language) and a non-verbal/imaginal system (for images).

**Details:** According to this theory, encoding information using both verbal and visual forms creates two separate but linked memory traces. This dual representation enhances memory and recall because it increases the number of available retrieval cues. People learn better from a combination of words and pictures than from words alone.

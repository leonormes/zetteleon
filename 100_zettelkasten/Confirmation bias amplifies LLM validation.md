title: Confirmation bias amplifies LLM validation
type:

If a user already believes their ideas have merit, confirmation bias will make them more likely to accept a positive or agreeable response from an LLM.

When the LLM provides a structured and seemingly intelligent analysis that aligns with the user's pre-existing view, it confirms that belief. This confirmation leads directly to a powerful sense of validation, as it reinforces what the user already suspected to be true about their own thoughts.

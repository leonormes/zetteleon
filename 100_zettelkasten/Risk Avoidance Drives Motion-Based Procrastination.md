Motion provides a sense of progress without the inherent risks associated with action. This makes it a compelling form of procrastination.

Action is uncertain and exposes an individual to potential negative outcomes:

- **Risk of failure:** The task may not be completed successfully.
- **Risk of criticism:** Others may judge the outcome or the effort.
- **Risk of unmet expectations:** The result may not align with personal or external standards.

Because motion involves preparatory or tangential tasks rather than direct execution, it feels safer. It allows one to feel productive while remaining shielded from the possibility of failure or judgment that action entails.

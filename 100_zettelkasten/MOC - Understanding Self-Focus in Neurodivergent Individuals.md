## MOC - Understanding Self-Focus in Neurodivergent Individuals

### Personal Context

As a 51-year-old neurodivergent father of three daughters, I've wrestled with understanding my own level of self-focus throughout my life. Strong feelings around social aspects have always dominated my inner experience, and I'm certain [[RSD is associated with neurodiversity particularly ADHD|I've suffered from RSD]] my whole life.

The question that troubles me: How self-centered am I? I don't mean selfish - I don't take from others, and I'm sensitive to their feelings. But I don't dedicate much time to thinking about doing things for people or solving problems for them the way I do for myself.

### The Challenge of "Normal"

The concept I've struggled to grasp is [[Self-focus exists on a spectrum rather than as a fixed point|what the "normal" level of self-focus is]]. It turns out there isn't a single standard, which is both liberating and frustrating.

### Patterns of Balance

[[Balanced relationships involve active listening remembering events offering help and sharing conversation time|In balanced relationships, people typically share attention relatively equally]]. They listen actively, remember important events, offer help when others struggle, consider preferences when making plans, and share conversation time.

However, context matters enormously. [[Higher self-focus is typical during crises health issues transitions and resource constraints|Higher self-focus is actually normal and expected]] during personal crises, health issues, major life transitions, professional performance situations, and when managing limited resources like time, energy, or money.

### Warning Signs

There are [[Signs of higher-than-typical self-focus include conversation domination and poor memory for others|certain patterns that might indicate higher-than-typical self-focus]]: consistently steering conversations back to your own experiences, difficulty remembering details about others' lives, rarely initiating contact unless you need something, and finding it hard to understand perspectives different from your own.

### The Neurodivergent Experience

This is where it gets complicated for people like me. [[Apparent self-focus in neurodivergent individuals may reflect social monitoring and processing differences|What appears as self-focus in neurodivergent individuals can actually be something quite different]]. The intense monitoring of social interactions to avoid rejection, the different way of processing sensory and social information, and the need for more recovery time after social interactions - these can all look like self-centeredness from the outside.

For those of us with RSD, the internal experience is often one of hypervigilance and fear, not indifference to others.

### ADHD Considerations

- Self-focus may stem from need for stimulation
- Balance with external accountability needed

### Practical Questions Over Abstract Standards

Rather than measuring myself against a nebulous "normal," perhaps better questions are:

1. Are my relationships mutually satisfying?
2. Do I have the capacity to shift focus to others when it matters?
3. Am I able to be present for important moments in loved ones' lives?

### Building Structure

[[Setting reminders and scheduling time can help structure social reciprocity practices|Simple practices can help create structure around social reciprocity]] when it doesn't come naturally. Setting reminders to check in with loved ones or scheduling time specifically for others' needs can make a real difference.

### Reflections

The hardest part is distinguishing between genuine self-centeredness and the neurodivergent experience of being constantly overwhelmed by my own internal processing. When you're spending enormous energy just managing your own experience - the sensory input, the emotional regulation, the fear of rejection - it's not that you don't care about others. It's that you're already at capacity.

This isn't an excuse. It's context. And understanding the context helps me figure out what I can realistically work on and what I need to accept about how my brain works.

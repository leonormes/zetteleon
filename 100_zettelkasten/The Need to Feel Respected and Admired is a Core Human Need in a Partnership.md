## The Need to Feel Respected and Admired is a Core Human Need in a Partnership

**Summary:** A fundamental human need often prioritized in long-term relationships is the need to feel respected and admired by one's partner.

**Details:** This is not about being put on a pedestal, but about feeling competent and trusted in one's domains, having one's efforts noticed and valued, and feeling that one's partner still respects and chooses them.

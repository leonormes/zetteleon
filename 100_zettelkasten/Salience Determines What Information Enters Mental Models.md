The brain constantly filters sensory input to decide what is "salient"—what is important and worthy of attention. This filtering isn't a conscious choice but is determined by key factors:

## Factors Determining Salience

**Novelty and Surprise**: Things that generate a "prediction error" are inherently salient. The unexpected sound, unusual object, or surprising turn of events automatically captures attention.

**Contrast**: Anything that stands out from its background becomes salient. A single red flower in a field of green grass is more salient than any individual blade of grass.

**Relevance to Goals**: Whatever you are currently focused on becomes salient. If you're looking for your keys, every key-shaped object in your visual field will seem to "pop out."

Information deemed salient is given priority and is far more likely to be incorporated into your working mental model of the moment.

Unlike mathematical models that have clear purposes making refinement easier, the brain uses subconscious filters of salience, emotion, and survival relevance to choose what information to use and what to drop.

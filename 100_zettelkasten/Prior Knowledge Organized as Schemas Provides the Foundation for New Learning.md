## Prior Knowledge Organized as Schemas Provides the Foundation for New Learning

**Summary:** According to Schema Theory, prior knowledge is organized into cognitive structures or mental frameworks called schemas, which provide the foundation for integrating new information.

**Details:** When encountering new information, learners attempt to fit it into existing schemas (assimilation). If the information doesn't fit, they must modify their schemas or create new ones (accommodation). Well-developed schemas make new, related information more meaningful and easier to learn by providing a rich network of existing concepts to which it can be anchored.

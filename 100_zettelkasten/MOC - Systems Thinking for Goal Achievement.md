This note summarizes the shift from traditional goal setting to systems-based thinking, which makes progress more natural and stress-free.

## Core Message

The core idea is to embrace [[Systems Thinking vs Goal Setting]]. While goals provide direction, systems are the actionable routines that create progress, and they have the advantage that [[Systems are Designed to Function on Low-Energy Days]].

## Three-Step System Creation

1.  **Start Small**: [[Effective Systems are Built From Tiny Initial Actions|Effective systems are built from tiny initial actions]] that are almost laughably small.
2.  **Consistency**: For building systems, [[Consistency is More Important Than Intensity for Building Systems|consistency is more important than intensity]].
3.  **Track Systems**: The focus of measurement should be to [[Track System Execution Not Goal Outcomes|track the execution of the system, not the outcome of the goal]].

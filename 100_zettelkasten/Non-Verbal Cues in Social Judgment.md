## Non-Verbal Cues in Social Judgment

**Summary:** Non-verbal communication channels—including micro-expressions, posture, eye contact, and gestures—provide the primary data stream for rapid social perception, often conveying more information than verbal content.

**Details:**

- **Micro-expressions**: Fleeting, involuntary facial movements that reveal genuine emotion before conscious masking occurs (typically lasting <200ms)
- **Posture and body orientation**: Open posture (uncrossed arms, facing toward) signals engagement; closed posture (crossed arms, turned away) may indicate defensiveness, discomfort, or simply physical comfort
- **Eye contact patterns**: Sustained eye contact generally signals interest and confidence, though cultural norms and neurodivergence significantly affect interpretation
- **Gesture mirroring**: Subconscious mimicry of another's body language strongly correlates with rapport and mutual comfort

**Limitations:** These cues are inherently ambiguous and culturally modulated. A crossed-arm posture might indicate defensiveness or simply that the person is cold. Context and cultural background are essential for accurate interpretation.

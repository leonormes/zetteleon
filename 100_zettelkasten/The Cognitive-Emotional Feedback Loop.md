Cognition (our mental models) and emotion are not separate, independent processes. They are deeply intertwined in a constant, bi-directional **feedback loop** where each continuously creates and reinforces the other.

1. **Emotion Shapes the Model:** A strong emotional event acts like a highlighter, marking an experience as important. As described in [[Salience and Emotion Shape Mental Models]], this ensures the experience is saved into our long-term mental model. A single frightening event can build a powerful model associating a place with danger.
2. **The Model Triggers the Emotion:** Once a model is built, it becomes an active filter for reality. The brain uses the model to interpret ambiguous data and predict outcomes. When you encounter a situation that matches a model tagged with a strong emotion (e.g., danger), the brain preemptively triggers the corresponding emotional and physiological response (e.g., fear). The emotion is a *consequence* of the model's interpretation.

This self-reinforcing cycle is how biases become entrenched and how phobias and anxiety can develop. The model creates the feeling, and the feeling validates the model. This loop can be broken, however, when [[Prediction Error Breaks Maladaptive Feedback Loops|reality provides a strong enough counter-signal]].

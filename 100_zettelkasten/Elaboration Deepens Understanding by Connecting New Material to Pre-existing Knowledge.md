## Elaboration Deepens Understanding by Connecting New Material to Pre-existing Knowledge

**Summary:** Elaboration is a learning strategy that involves actively expanding on new material by connecting it to what you already know, making the new information more meaningful and memorable.

**Details:** This process typically involves asking "how" and "why" questions, generating original examples, forming analogies, and explicitly identifying relationships between new concepts and existing knowledge. This creates a richer, more interconnected network of retrieval cues in memory.

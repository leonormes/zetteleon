An action trigger is a pre-defined rule that forces a transition from motion to action. It serves as a clear boundary that prevents the preparatory phase from extending indefinitely.

This concept is similar to an [[Implementation Intentions]], which takes the form of "When situation X arises, I will perform response Y."

Examples of action triggers:

- **For writing:** "After I have outlined three bullet points, I will start writing the first paragraph."
- **For sales:** "After I have identified five potential clients, I will call the first one."
- **For coding:** "After I have researched one possible solution for 15 minutes, I will start implementing it."

By defining these triggers in advance, the decision to act is removed from the moment, bypassing the potential for fear or uncertainty to lead to further procrastination.

# The Need for Physical Intimacy and Affection is a Vital Form of Connection

**Summary:** Physical intimacy and affection are a vital form of connection and communication in a long-term partnership, extending beyond just sexual activity.

**Details:** This need encompasses non-sexual touch like holding hands, cuddling, and hugs, which communicate care and closeness. It also includes the need to feel desired and that intimacy is a positive, shared activity rather than a chore.

I don't know how to find things in obsidian. Like this bullet point. Let's say another day I come back to this question. How do I continue from here and not just rewrite this same thought? This is a theme of my obsidian use. A theme of my PKM. And writing to think. I want to come back to this at a later date to add to it.

[[Zettelkasten Ain't Easy]]

I have come back here from the main index. It is exactly right. I have to link things this way. It is very simple!

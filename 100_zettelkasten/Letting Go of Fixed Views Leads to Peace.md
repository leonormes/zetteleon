## Letting Go of Fixed Views Leads to Peace

**Summary:** Suffering increases when we insist that the world, other people, or ourselves conform to our fixed preferences and views.

**Details:** According to Zen teachings, compassion and peace arise when we let go of needing things to be different than they are. This involves releasing the attachment to our own perspectives and expectations, allowing us to accept reality without resistance. This practice reduces internal conflict and fosters a more compassionate relationship with oneself and others.

Faced with the [[Psychological Stress of Dissonance]], individuals are motivated to resolve the internal conflict. There are several common strategies for this:

1. **Changing a Belief:** The individual may alter one of the conflicting beliefs to make it consistent with the other.
2. **Seeking Validation:** The individual may seek out information or social support that confirms their existing belief, thereby reducing the impact of the conflicting information. This is a form of confirmation bias.
3. **Downplaying the Conflict:** The individual may trivialize the importance of the conflicting beliefs, making the inconsistency seem less significant.
4. **Changing Behavior:** If the conflict is between a belief and a behavior, the individual may change their behavior to align with their belief.

These strategies are all aimed at reducing the discomfort of [[Cognitive Dissonance]].

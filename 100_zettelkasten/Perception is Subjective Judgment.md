Our perceptions are the root cause of many of our problems because they are not objective realities, but subjective judgments applied to events. We do not see the world as it is; we see it as we are.

The "perceiving eye," as described in [[The Observing Eye vs The Perceiving Eye MOC]], is what takes a neutral event (e.g., a delayed flight) and applies a subjective judgment to it ("This is a disaster"). This judgment, not the event itself, is what creates feelings of anger, frustration, or despair.

Objectivity, therefore, means removing the "you"—the subjective, emotional self—from the equation. When we give advice to others, their problems often seem clear because we are detached from the emotional baggage. The goal of [[The Discipline of Perception (Stoicism)]] is to achieve this same dispassionate clarity for our own problems.

To do this, we can employ various [[Techniques for Objective Perception]].

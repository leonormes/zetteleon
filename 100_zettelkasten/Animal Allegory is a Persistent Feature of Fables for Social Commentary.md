Across its long evolution, the key continuity in the fable genre is the persistent use of animal allegory as a vehicle for social and moral commentary.

By attributing human-like behaviors, flaws, and virtues to animal characters, storytellers can address sensitive or controversial topics—such as political corruption, social inequality, and human folly—in an indirect and less confrontational way.

This allegorical distance allows the audience to consider the message without becoming defensive, making the fable a uniquely resilient and adaptable form of storytelling for social critique.

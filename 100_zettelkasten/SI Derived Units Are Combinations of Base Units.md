title: SI Derived Units Are Combinations of Base Units
type:

**Derived units** are formed by combining the [[The Seven SI Base Units|seven SI base units]] through multiplication and division. There are an unlimited number of possible derived units.

Twenty-two of these derived units have been given special names for simplicity.

## How They Are Used in Science

Derived units allow for the measurement of complex quantities. For example:

- **Force**: The **newton (N)** is defined as kg⋅m⋅s−2. It's the force required to accelerate one kilogram of mass at one metre per second squared.
- **Energy**: The **joule (J)** is defined as kg⋅m2⋅s−2. It's the energy transferred when a force of one newton is applied over one metre.
- **Pressure**: The **pascal (Pa)** is defined as kg⋅m−1⋅s−2, or one newton per square metre (N/m2).

Using derived units creates a [[A Coherent System of Units Simplifies Physical Equations|coherent system]] where physical laws can be expressed cleanly without conversion factors.

## SN - Sequence: The Problems with a Goals-First Mentality

### Framing Question

What are the specific, identifiable problems with a "goals-first" mentality that make it an inferior strategy to a "systems-first" approach?

### Train of Thought Sequence

The philosophy of prioritizing systems over goals is rooted in the principle that [[You Fall to the Level of Your Systems, Not Rise to Your Goals]]. This suggests that a focus on goals is inherently flawed. Here are the specific reasons why.

1.  **Goals are a poor measure of success.** Success is often attributed to ambitious goals, but this is a logical fallacy. In reality, [[Goals Suffer from Survivorship Bias]], as losers often have the same goals as winners. The goal isn't the differentiator.
2.  **Goals provide only temporary solutions.** A goal-oriented approach treats the symptom, not the cause. [[Achieving a Goal is a Momentary Change Without Systemic Improvement]], meaning the problem will likely recur if the underlying system isn't fixed.
3.  **Goals create a restrictive mindset around happiness.** The pursuit of goals often leads to a psychological trap. [[A Goals-First Mentality Restricts Happiness]] by postponing satisfaction until the outcome is achieved, whereas a systems approach finds joy in the process.
4.  **Goals are at odds with long-term progress.** A system is built for continuous improvement, while a goal has a finite end. As explored in the related sequence on systems, [[Systems are Designed for Continuous Play, Not a Single Win]], which prevents the motivational decline that often follows the achievement of a major goal.

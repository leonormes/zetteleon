The "Motivation Bridge" is a metaphor used to explain why individuals with ADHD often struggle to translate intention into action, even for tasks they genuinely care about.

## Core Concept

Motivation is described as a bridge that connects the *intention* to do a task with the *action* of actually doing it.

- **For neurotypical individuals**, this bridge may have small, manageable gaps that can be crossed with a reasonable amount of willpower.
- **For individuals with ADHD**, entire sections of the bridge may be missing. This is not a matter of not caring or not trying; the connection between intention and action is neurologically broken.

This is why ADHD is sometimes described as a "motivation deficit disorder." The challenge is not a lack of desire, but a lack of the neurochemical ability to act.

## How to Build the Bridge

The solution is not to apply more willpower, but to creatively "fill in the missing planks" of the bridge. This involves structuring the task or environment to be more stimulating for the ADHD brain. The three main strategies for this are:

1. **Make it Urgent**: Create external accountability and deadlines.
2. **Make it New or Novel**: Change the environment or the method to increase stimulation.
3. **Make it Personally Interesting**: Connect the task to a genuine interest, passion, or curiosity.

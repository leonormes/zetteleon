The pressure to achieve a perfect outcome can be a significant driver of procrastination, making the risk-free domain of "motion" more appealing. A powerful mental shift is to focus on the effort being applied rather than the result it will produce.

By setting a goal to simply put in the time or perform the action, regardless of the quality of the immediate output, the barrier to starting is lowered significantly. This approach decouples the act of working from the fear of failure.

For example, instead of setting a goal to "write a perfect chapter" (outcome-focused), one could set a goal to "write for one hour" (effort-focused). The latter is entirely within one's control and carries no immediate judgment of quality, making it much easier to initiate.

This aligns with the concept of [[Process vs Outcome Goals|process goals]], where the focus is on the repeatable actions one takes, not the ultimate achievement.

Perseverance, also known as grit, is the quality of finishing what you start, even when it becomes difficult or challenging.

It involves a combination of passion and persistence applied toward long-term goals. It is about working hard, maintaining focus, and not giving up in the face of obstacles or setbacks.

This strength is a key predictor of success and is fundamental to achieving mastery in any field.

title: Primes Become Rarer But Remain Searchable

The Prime Number Theorem describes how primes are distributed. As numbers get larger, the percentage of numbers that are prime decreases. The density thins out.

However, the absolute number of primes still grows towards infinity. This predictable thinning means that while finding a 300-digit prime requires searching, it is not an impossibly long search for a computer. This makes the generation of new cryptographic keys feasible.

The modern scientific consensus, particularly in evolutionary biology, describes a non-teleological universe. This view asserts that the universe and its contents did not come into being for any pre-ordained reason or purpose.

## Core Principle

In a non-teleological universe, complex systems and life arise through natural processes without any guiding purpose or predetermined goal. Things happen because of physical laws and interactions, not because they are "meant to" happen.

## Scientific Foundation

This perspective is fundamental to:

- Evolutionary biology - species evolve through natural selection, not toward a goal
- Cosmology - the universe expands and evolves according to physical laws
- Chemistry - complex molecules form through thermodynamic processes

## Implications

Life is seen as an [[Emergence|emergent property]] of chemistry, not the result of a guided process. Complex patterns and behaviors arise naturally from simple interactions - they "just happen."

## Contrast with Teleological Thinking

This directly opposes [[Teleology|teleological explanations]] that assume inherent purpose or design in natural phenomena.

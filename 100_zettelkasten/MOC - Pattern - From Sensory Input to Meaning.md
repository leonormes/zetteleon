## MOC - Pattern - From Sensory Input to Meaning

> **Inclusion criteria:** Atomic notes related to the concept of pattern, from its cognitive origins to its formalization in mathematics.

### Part I: The Architecture of Human Pattern Recognition

This section explores the biological and psychological foundations of pattern recognition.

#### 1.1 The Brain as a Pattern-Seeking Engine

[[Pattern Recognition is the Cognitive Process of Organizing Sensory Input]] rel:: defines the core concept. This process is not passive; it is an innate drive, as [[The Brain is a Pattern-Seeking Engine]] rel:: explains the neurobiological origins. However, this powerful drive has a downside, which is [[Apophenia is the Tendency to Perceive Patterns in Random Data]] rel:: describes as a cognitive bias.

#### 1.2 The Evolutionary Advantage

The ability for "pattern-sniffing" was not a cognitive luxury but a crucial survival tool. [[Pattern Recognition Conferred an Evolutionary Survival Advantage]] rel:: explains how this skill was critical for early humans. From a cognitive economics perspective, [[Pattern Recognition is an Efficient Cognitive Heuristic]] rel:: describes how it allows the brain to compress data and make rapid decisions.

#### 1.3 From Infancy to Expertise

This innate ability is active from birth. [[Early Childhood Patterning is the Foundation for Language Acquisition]] rel:: demonstrates its role in learning language. This meta-skill of learning how to learn shows that [[Patterns are the Scaffolding of Knowledge]] rel:: explains.

#### 1.4 The Human Distinction

[[Human Pattern Recognition is Abstract and Domain-General]] rel:: contrasts our flexible, cross-modal abilities with the more specialized cognition found in other animals.

### Part II: Mathematics: The Formal Language of Patterns

This section bridges the intuitive drive for patterns with its most rigorous expression: mathematics.

#### 2.1 The Science of Patterns

The modern, profound definition is that [[Mathematics Is Frequently Described as the Science of Patterns]] rel:: defines. This is formalized in educational frameworks through "Mathematical Habits of Mind," such as [[SMP 7 is Looking For and Making Use of Structure]] rel:: example-of and [[SMP 8 is Looking For and Expressing Regularity in Repeated Reasoning]] rel:: example-of.

#### 2.2 The Engine of Discovery

[[The Process of Mathematical Discovery is Driven by Pattern Recognition]] rel:: describes the workflow from intuitive observation to formal proof, highlighting the interplay between creative induction and logical deduction.

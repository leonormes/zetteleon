Mindset and emotional regulation are crucial for managing ADHD, as challenges with executive function are often intertwined with emotional responses like frustration, shame, and anxiety. These strategies complement [[ADHD Behavioral Strategies for Productivity]].

Key mindset shifts include:

- **Practice Self-Compassion**: Acknowledge that ADHD is a neurological condition, not a character flaw. Shift from self-criticism to non-judgmental observation of behaviors.
- **Focus on Process, Not Just Outcome**: Celebrate small wins, like starting a task or sticking to a timebox, to build dopamine and self-trust.
- **Reframe "Boring" Tasks**: Connect mundane activities to a larger "Why" or core principle to engage the interest-based motivation system.
- **Embrace Imperfection**: Aim for "good enough" rather than perfection, especially in system maintenance. Consistency is more valuable than intensity.

## Finances in an Unequal-Income Partnership Should Be Treated as Shared Family Money

**Summary:** In a cooperative partnership with an income disparity, the most successful approach is to treat all income as "family money" rather than "yours" and "mine."

**Details:** This mindset decouples earnings from the right to have a say in financial decisions. Both partners' contributions, whether monetary or otherwise (e.g., household management, childcare), are seen as integral parts of a single family system. This prevents the higher earner from having more control and the lower earner from feeling like a "junior partner."

Self-regulation is the ability to manage your emotions, thoughts, and actions in a controlled and deliberate way.

It involves thinking before acting and responding to situations with awareness rather than impulsivity. This skill is a core component of emotional intelligence and is crucial for making sound decisions and achieving long-term goals.

Developing self-regulation allows one to navigate life's challenges with greater stability and purpose.

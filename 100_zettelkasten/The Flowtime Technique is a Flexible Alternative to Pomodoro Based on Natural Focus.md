# The Flowtime Technique is a Flexible Alternative to Pomodoro Based on Natural Focus

**Summary:** The Flowtime Technique is a flexible approach to focused work where an individual works on a single task with deep concentration, taking breaks only when their focus or energy naturally dips, rather than adhering to a fixed timer.

**Details:** This method is an alternative to the rigid intervals of the Pomodoro Technique. Users track the duration of their focused work sessions ("flow states") and subsequent breaks to gain a better understanding of their personal productivity rhythms. It is particularly well-suited for creative work that benefits from long periods of immersion.

Task Initiation: Difficulties with executive functions, particularly initiating tasks that aren't immediately stimulating or urgent, are common in ADHD. The perceived effort of creating a "proper" Zettelkasten note – deciding on the idea's atomicity, formulating the perfect title, finding relevant links, adding tags – can create significant friction, making it hard to even start.

My hardest limiter is getting started. Even small tasks cause me too much effort to start. It's like surface tension between not doing task and doing task. The effort to push through that barrier is harder than for typical people. Is this an ADHD thing? What can I do?

I really need to focus on task initiation. It is the single simple thing that will help me. I should focus on that. Exclude other distractions. If I can build a habit of starting, I can then get better at planning next actions

I very often get that heavy weight on me when trying to do things. Or if I do finish something I can't move on to the next thing.

I often have a feeling of overwhelm when I think of a task. Especially at work. I imagine I have to do it perfectly and then realise there is so much to do to get it perfect. I then slid it on favour of preparing.

My task of exposing the echo server. I am paralysed by it. I just need to read the instructions. Give my Aws user permission to call it.

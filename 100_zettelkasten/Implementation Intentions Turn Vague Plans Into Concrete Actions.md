**Summary:** Implementation intentions are specific plans for when and where actions will occur, transforming vague notions into concrete plans that sweep away ambiguity and create triggers for action.

**The Problem They Solve:**

Vague intentions like "I want to work out more" or "I want to be more productive" lack the specificity needed to trigger action. Without clear cues about *when* and *where*, these intentions remain abstract and easily avoided.

**What Implementation Intentions Are:**

An implementation intention follows the format: "When [SITUATION X OCCURS], I will [PERFORM BEHAVIOR Y]" or "At [TIME] in [LOCATION], I will [ACTION]."

**Examples:**

- **Vague:** "I want to work out more"
- **Implementation Intention:** "Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 7 AM, I will go to the gym before work"
- **Vague:** "I need to write more"
- **Implementation Intention:** "After I finish my morning coffee at my desk, I will write for 30 minutes"

**Why They Work:**

1. **Creates Triggers:** Being specific about the time and space for a habit helps create a trigger or cue for action
2. **Reduces Decision Fatigue:** Pre-deciding eliminates the moment-to-moment "should I do this now?" question
3. **Increases Follow-Through:** Research shows that the more closely bound a new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that the action will be taken
4. **Makes Time Tangible:** Scheduling creates accountability and makes abstract time concrete

**The Power of Specificity:**

Implementation intentions work because they remove ambiguity. The brain doesn't have to decide *if* to act or *when* to act—those decisions are already made. The only remaining question is whether to follow through on the pre-made plan.

**For ADHD Brains:**

Implementation intentions are particularly powerful for ADHD because they externalize the executive function of planning and decision-making. Instead of relying on in-the-moment willpower and working memory, the decision is pre-made and cued by environmental context.

**Practical Application:**

To create effective implementation intentions:

1. Identify the behavior you want to perform
2. Choose a specific time or triggering situation
3. Choose a specific location
4. State the complete plan: "When/At [TIME/SITUATION] in [LOCATION], I will [SPECIFIC ACTION]"

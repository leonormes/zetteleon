## Identity Emerges From Habits

**Summary:** Your identity is not a fixed trait you are born with; it emerges from the accumulation of your habits and actions over time.

**Details:** Your habits are the way you embody and live out your identity. Each action you take reinforces a particular self-image. Therefore, you can shape your identity by consciously choosing and repeating the habits associated with the person you wish to become.

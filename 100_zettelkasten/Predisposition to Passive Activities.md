title: Predisposition to Passive Activities

The sources suggest that ADHD brains can lean towards activities that offer an illusion of progress and a dopamine reward without requiring significant effort or uncomfortable action, which can be interpreted as passive engagement.

For instance, the "Collector's Fallacy" describes how individuals might focus on merely gathering information (a passive, dopamine-seeking activity) rather than actively processing or creating with it.

This avoids the "discomfort of action" and can become a form of procrastination. Similarly, the mind might get "stuck" in the Default Mode Network (DMN), leading to brooding and self-critical thoughts without productive output, indicating a state of mental passivity in terms of task engagement.

ADHD brains can also experience "analysis paralysis," making it difficult to initiate tasks and leading to inaction due to the overwhelming nature of vague tasks. While the ADHD mind is described as "constantly at work," this mental activity doesn't always translate into visible productivity due to a perceived lack of intent or energy, which can manifest as outward passivity.

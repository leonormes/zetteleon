This note provides an overview of the neurological and psychological factors that cause difficulty with task initiation in individuals with ADHD.

## Causes of Task Initiation Difficulty in ADHD

1.  **Executive Dysfunction**: [[Executive Function Challenges are Central to ADHD]] impair the brain's ability to plan, prioritize, and organize tasks.
2.  **Dopamine Dysregulation**: [[Dopamine Dysregulation is a Key Factor in ADHD Motivation]], which impairs the brain's reward system and makes starting tasks feel unrewarding.
3.  **Emotional Dysregulation**: [[Emotional Dysregulation]] can lead to feelings of overwhelm, frustration, or fear of failure, resulting in [[ADHD Paralysis is the Inability to Start a Task Until it Becomes an Emergency|task paralysis]].
4.  **Poor Working Memory**: [[Working Memory Limitations in ADHD]] make it difficult to hold task-related information in mind long enough to initiate action.
5.  **Distractions and Overstimulation**: The brain's difficulty in filtering distractions, partly explained by [[The Glitchy Switch - TPN and DMN Dysregulation in ADHD]], can derail focus before a task begins.

## Distinction from Laziness

It is crucial to understand that [[ADHD Task Initiation Difficulty is a Neurological Issue Not Laziness]]. The struggle is an involuntary response rooted in neurological impairments, not a lack of effort or desire.

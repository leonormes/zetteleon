**Definition:** Analysis is the rigorous, formal study of limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, and infinite processes, providing the logical foundation for calculus.

**Relationship to Calculus:** While calculus provides computational tools for working with continuous change, analysis establishes the precise definitions and proofs that ensure those tools are logically sound.

**Foundation:** Analysis is built on a deep understanding of the structure of the real number line (ℝ), particularly the completeness property that distinguishes the reals from the rationals.

**Key Concepts:** ε-δ definitions of limits, convergence of sequences and series, continuity, uniform convergence, measure theory, and functional analysis.

**Purpose:** Analysis ensures that intuitions about continuous functions and infinitesimal quantities are placed on rigorous logical footing.

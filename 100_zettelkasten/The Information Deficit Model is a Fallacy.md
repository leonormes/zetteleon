## The Information Deficit Model is a Fallacy

**Summary:** The "information deficit model"—the assumption that providing people with more information will lead them to change their behavior—is a consistently debunked fallacy.

**Details:** Behavioral science shows that knowledge and awareness alone are insufficient to cause behavior change. While information is necessary, it does not automatically bridge the intention-action gap. Interventions that focus on context, environmental cues, reducing friction, and implementation planning are far more effective than those that simply provide more information.

## An Action Can Be Formally Modeled as a State Transformation Function

**Summary:** An action can be formally modeled as a function `A: (S_pre, I) → (S_post, O)`, where it transforms a pre-state and inputs into a post-state and a binary output.

**Details:**
-   **S_pre (Pre-State):** The required context or conditions before the action can begin.
-   **I (Inputs):** Any necessary resources or information.
-   **S_post (Post-State):** The new state of the system after the action is completed.
-   **O (Output):** A binary signal (e.g., Done = 1) indicating successful completion.
This model emphasizes that actions are state transformations with clear preconditions and postconditions.

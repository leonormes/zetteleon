## Political Subversion Through Animal Allegory

**Summary:** Animal fables enable covert social criticism by:
- Disguising messages as children's tales
- Providing plausible deniability
- Universalizing specific critiques

**Historical Examples:**
- The Lion's Share (power dynamics)
- The Frogs Desiring a King (political satire)
- Modern inheritors like Animal Farm

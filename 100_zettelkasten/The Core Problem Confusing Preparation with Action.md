title: The Core Problem Confusing Preparation with Action

The book identifies a central error in thinking that fuels this type of procrastination: we mistake planning, deciding, and preparing for meaningful action.

- Deciding is Not Doing: The book strongly emphasizes that making a decision, while it may feel like progress, changes nothing in the real world. It's a mental activity, a thought, not an action. The real world is only affected by tangible actions.
- Preparation as a Form of Avoidance: For many, the most common problem is knowing what needs to be done but not doing it. The book explicitly states that activities like "researching your options, making a plan, going to therapy, [and] ruminating about your inaction" can be highly effective strategies for avoiding the actual work.
- "Painting the Bullock Cart Wheels": This analogy from Eknath Easwaran captures the essence of procrastination disguised as busyness. A farmer, needing to bring in the harvest, instead spends a week painting beautiful designs on his cart wheels. We often engage in less important, preparatory tasks (like endless research or organisation) to avoid the central, more daunting task.
- [[Morita Therapy - Purpose-Driven Action Over Emotion]] provides a philosophical framework for prioritizing action over preparation.

Psychologist Dr. Ramani Dervasula outlines seven steps to owning emotions, which aligns with Musashi's principles. These include:

- Acknowledging them
- Recognising them as one's own
- Expressing them appropriately
- Managing them
- Considering perspective

Suppression, as Sigmund Freud noted, only fuels emotions, leading to uglier manifestations later.

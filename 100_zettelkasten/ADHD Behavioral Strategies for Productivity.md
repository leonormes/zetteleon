Beyond building complex systems, many effective strategies for managing ADHD focus on behavior, environment, and mindset.

Key behavioral and habit-based strategies include:

- **Embrace "Motion Creates Emotion"**: Start with tiny actions to build momentum, as described in [[Motion Creates Emotion to Overcome Inertia]].
- **Master Micro-Actions & Starter Tasks**: Break down daunting tasks into 5-minute (or less) physical first steps.
- **Habit Stacking & Anchoring**: Link new habits to existing routines to automate them.
- **ADHD-Adapted Timeboxing**: Use visual timers and flexible work blocks.
- **Regular, Short Reviews**: Implement daily "micro-clarify" sessions instead of one long weekly review to maintain system trust.

These behavioral approaches can be complemented by [[Environmental Design for ADHD Focus]] and [[ADHD Mindset and Emotional Regulation Strategies]]. It's also powerful to [[Leveraging ADHD Traits as Strengths]].

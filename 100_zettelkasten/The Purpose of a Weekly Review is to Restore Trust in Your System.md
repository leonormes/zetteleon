The primary purpose of a Weekly Review in a productivity system like GTD (Getting Things Done) is to regain clarity, control, and perspective over one's commitments. Its ultimate goal is to make the system current and trustworthy.

When the system is trusted, the mind can relax and disengage, knowing that everything important has been captured and has a plan. This allows for focused engagement on the chosen action without the "open loops" and mental clutter of unresolved commitments.

Achieving this state of trust requires performing the [[Core Actions of a GTD Weekly Review]].

Regular reviews combat [[Nihilism vs Constructed Meaning|meaning drift]] by:
- Reinforcing chosen priorities

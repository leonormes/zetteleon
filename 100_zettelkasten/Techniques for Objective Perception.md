To strengthen the [[The Observing Eye vs The Perceiving Eye MOC|observing eye]] and weaken the reactive, subjective perceiving eye, one can practice several Stoic techniques designed to create space between an event and our perception of it.

1. **Question the Impulse:** The first step is to resist the animalistic impulse to immediately react to an impression. We must force a pause—to "Hold on a moment"—and question our initial perception before we act on it. This creates a space for reason to intervene.
2. **Contemptuous Expressions:** This technique involves stripping an event of its cultural ornamentation and euphemisms to see it for what it truly is. For example, a fine wine is "fermented grape juice"; a luxury car is "metal, plastic, and rubber." This practice lays things bare and diminishes their power over our emotions.
3. **Simulated Detachment:** A powerful exercise is to pretend the situation is not happening to you, or that it is not important. By viewing the problem as if it were a friend's, you can achieve a more dispassionate and objective assessment of the situation and the available options.

These techniques are not passive reflections; they are a form of mental training that, through repetition, builds the "muscle" of objectivity required for [[The Discipline of Perception (Stoicism)]].

title: The P-PC Balance (Production vs Production Capability)
type:

**The P/PC Balance** is a fundamental principle of effectiveness, illustrating the necessary balance between **Production (P)** and **Production Capability (PC)**.

- **P (Production):** The desired results, the output. In the fable, this is the golden egg.
- **PC (Production Capability):** The producing asset, the system or person that creates the output. In the fable, this is the goose.

Effectiveness lies in the balance. If you focus only on getting the golden eggs (P), you may neglect the goose (PC) until it can no longer produce. Conversely, if you only take care of the goose (PC) with no concern for the eggs (P), you won't be able to feed yourself or the goose.

## Application

This principle applies to all areas of life:

- **Physical Assets:** Focusing only on production (e.g., running a machine constantly) without maintenance (PC) leads to breakdowns.
- **Financial Assets:** The principal (PC) is what generates the interest (P). If you invade the principal, your capability to produce income is diminished.
- **Human Assets:** For individuals, PC is our physical, mental, and emotional capacity. If we work relentlessly (P) without rest and renewal (PC), we burn out.

[[Habit 7 - Sharpen the Saw]] is the habit of investing in your own PC. It is the conscious decision to maintain and enhance your personal capacity to produce results in the long term.

**Summary:** Converting a vague captured thought ("stuff") into an atomic action follows a clear four-step clarification function that transforms ambiguity into actionability.

**The Problem: "Stuff"**

When you capture items in your inbox, they're often vague, ambiguous, or unclear. Examples:

- "Mom's birthday"
- "Website redesign"
- "Talk to John"
- "Q3 planning"

These aren't actionable—they're just "stuff." The clarification process transforms this stuff into concrete actions.

**The Four-Step Clarification Process:**

**Step 1: Clarify the "Stuff"**

Ask two fundamental questions:

1. **"What is this?"** - Identify the nature of the captured item
2. **"What is the desired outcome?"** - Define what "done" looks like

**Examples:**

| Stuff | What is this? | Desired outcome |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Mom's birthday" | A commitment to celebrate | Mom feels celebrated and appreciated |
| "Website redesign" | A major project | New website is live and functional |
| "Talk to John" | A needed conversation | Alignment on project timeline |

This step converts vague captures into clear commitments with defined end states.

**Step 2: Define the Project**

Determine if this requires more than one step. If yes, it's a project that needs:

- A clear name describing the outcome
- A specific definition of "done"
- Multiple actions to complete it

**Decision tree:**
- **One action?** → It's a simple task, skip to Step 3
- **Multiple actions?** → It's a project, give it a name and "done" state

**Examples:**

| Stuff | One action or project? | Project definition |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|
| "Mom's birthday" | Project | "Mom's Birthday Celebration Complete" - Done when: party held, gift given |
| "Talk to John" | One action | N/A - single conversation |
| "Website redesign" | Project | "Website Redesign Live" - Done when: new site is launched and old site redirects |

**Step 3: Identify the Next Action**

Determine the very next *physical* step required to move toward completion. This must satisfy all four properties of an atomic action:

- Indivisible
- Physical & visible
- Unambiguous done state
- Context-specific

**Examples:**

| Commitment | Next action |
|------------|-------------|
| Mom's Birthday project | `@phone`: Call Mom to ask what she wants to do for birthday |
| Website Redesign project | `@computer`: Create shared folder for redesign mockups |
| Talk to John (task) | `@phone`: Call John to discuss project timeline |

**The key question:** "What is the very next thing I need to *do*?"

**Step 4: Apply the Momentum Method**

If that next action still feels too big or daunting, break it down further until you have a ridiculously small `@starter_task`.

**Examples:**

**Next Action:** `@computer`: Create shared folder for redesign mockups
**Still feels hard?** Break it down:
- `@starter_task`: Open Google Drive
- `@starter_task`: Click "New Folder" button
- `@starter_task`: Type "Website Redesign Mockups"

**Next Action:** `@phone`: Call Mom to ask about birthday plans
**Still feels hard?** Break it down:
- `@starter_task`: Find Mom's phone number
- `@starter_task`: Dial Mom's number

Continue breaking down until activation energy is near zero.

**The Complete Function:**

```sh
clarify(stuff) → action
where:
  1. stuff = vague captured thought
  2. clarified_stuff = understanding of commitment + desired outcome
  3. project_or_task = classification based on complexity
  4. next_action = atomic, physical, specific step
  5. starter_task = optional ultra-small first step
  
  return starter_task OR next_action
```

**Why This Process Works:**

**1. Eliminates Ambiguity:**
Every captured item is processed to a concrete action state

**2. Creates Momentum:**
By defining the next physical step, you always know what to do next

**3. Reduces Overwhelm:**
Breaking projects into atomic actions makes large commitments manageable

**4. Enables Progress:**
Clear actions can be completed; vague "stuff" cannot

**For ADHD:**

This process is especially valuable because:

**Externalizes Decision-Making:**
- You're not deciding "what should I do about this?" in the moment
- The clarification happens once, during processing
- Decisions are pre-made when cognitive load is lower

**Prevents Paralysis:**
- No vague items to stare at in confusion
- Always a clear next step
- Starter tasks provide guaranteed entry point

**Builds Trust:**
- System consistently delivers actionable items
- No surprises or ambiguity
- Reduces anxiety about forgotten commitments

**Implementation Tips:**

**Schedule Clarification Time:**
Don't clarify during capture. Capture quickly, then schedule dedicated time to process your inbox using this four-step process.

**Batch Processing:**
Process multiple items in one sitting using the same clarification workflow for each.

**Write It Down:**
Document the project definition and next action in your task manager. Don't rely on memory.

**Review Regularly:**
During weekly review, ensure every project has a defined next action using this process.

**Common Mistakes:**

**Skipping the "Desired Outcome" Question:**
Without a clear outcome, you can't know when you're done. Always define "done."

**Stopping at Step 2:**
Defining the project isn't enough—you need the next physical action (Step 3).

**Making Actions Too Big:**
If you find yourself avoiding an action, it's too big. Apply Step 4 and create a starter task.

**Not Writing It Down:**
Processing in your head doesn't count. Capture the outcome of clarification in your system.

**The Power of the Process:**

By following these four steps rigorously, every captured item becomes actionable. Stuff transforms into progress.

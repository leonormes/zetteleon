Timeboxing is the practice of dedicating specific, fixed blocks of time to particular tasks or activities.

Unlike an open-ended to-do list where tasks are listed without a schedule, timeboxing assigns each task a concrete allocation on a calendar. This transforms a vague intention into a specific commitment.

## Example
- **To-Do List Item:** "Write article"
- **Timeboxed Item:** "Tuesday 9:00-11:00 AM: Write article introduction and first section"

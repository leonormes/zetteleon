Avoiding the snooze button is a key strategy for a successful wake-up routine. By placing an alarm clock in a location that requires physically getting out of bed to turn it off (e.g., under the bed), you create a situation where you are forced to move, making it harder to fall back asleep. This approach bypasses the mental negotiation that often leads to oversleeping.

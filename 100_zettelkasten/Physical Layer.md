The OSI Physical and Data Link layers roughly correspond to the TCP/IP Network Access layer.

At the mysterious boundary between software and hardware sits the Physical Layer. It takes the raw digital stream of 0s and 1s and converts/shapes it into signals that can be transmitted across the physical network medium, be it copper wire, fibre optic cable, or radio waves.

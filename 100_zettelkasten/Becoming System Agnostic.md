[[I Don't Like Dependencies]].

This thought started about markdown notes but I also have the same feelings about code. I want things to be independent. It is more flexible.

I like something to be flexible and not be complicated to remember. Systems get overly complicated and seem good at the time, but there is too much meta skill involved in doing the system. You have to know too much about how it all works. You can't just think and track that thinking.

This is like splitting the data from the implementation.

Although this next note is about Zettelkasten specifically, it is part of a broader problem. [[Back to Simpler Ways]]

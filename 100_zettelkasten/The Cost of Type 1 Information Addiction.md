The continuous pursuit of theoretical ([[Type 1 Information is Theoretical and Addictive for Overthinkers]]) creates an illusion of clarity and preparedness without leading to actual progress. This addiction increases proficiency in theoretical processing while causing experiential skills (handling [[Type 2 Information is Experiential and Feared by Overthinkers]]) to decline, widening the gap between thought and action.

This reinforces the [[The Overthinking Loop Creates Mental Noise Not Clarity]].

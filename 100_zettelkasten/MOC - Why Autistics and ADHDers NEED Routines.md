## MOC - Why Autistics and ADHDers NEED Routines

### Why Routines Are Critical

[[Routines reduce anxiety and decision fatigue in neurodivergent individuals]], bringing essential stability to what can often feel like a chaotic world. [[Structure conserves cognitive energy for neurodivergent brains]], allowing individuals to allocate their limited executive function resources to meaningful tasks rather than constant decision-making. This structured approach directly addresses the [[Executive Function Challenges are Central to ADHD]] that make daily functioning difficult.

### Building Supportive Routines

#### Three Key Ingredients

1. **Know Your Needs and Preferences**
   [[Self-monitoring reveals personal energy and trigger patterns]] through systematic observation of daily activities, mood states, and environmental triggers. This week-long tracking process identifies when you have peak energy versus when you're prone to [[Overwhelm]]. Understanding your sensory sensitivities allows you to adjust both environment and schedule accordingly.

2. **Consistency**
   [[Anchor times create routine consistency]] by establishing fixed points for important daily tasks. Building rituals around these anchor points provides the predictability neurodivergent brains crave, though it's essential to include buffer slots for unexpected events.

3. **Incorporate Flexibility**
   [[Contingency planning manages routine disruptions]] by preparing alternative pathways before disruptions occur. When routines get interrupted, [[Sensory supports facilitate routine transitions]] through tools like noise-cancelling headphones, visual aids, and fidget objects.

### Maintenance Strategies

[[Visual schedules enhance routine adherence]] by making abstract time concepts tangible, similar to how [[Visual Timers for ADHD Time Blindness]] work. These external scaffolds compensate for executive function deficits by reducing the cognitive load of remembering routine steps.

[[Regular routine review prevents stagnation]] through monthly and seasonal adjustments. As life circumstances change, routines must evolve to remain supportive rather than constraining.

Critically, [[Downtime scheduling prevents neurodivergent burnout]] - rest periods must be treated as non-negotiable routine elements, not optional additions. This acknowledges the higher energy expenditure required for neurodivergent individuals to navigate neurotypical environments.

[[Celebrating small wins builds routine momentum]] through positive reinforcement. This approach aligns with [[The Interest-Based Nervous System in ADHD]], using intrinsic motivation rather than external pressure.

### Practical Implementation Framework

#### Example Daily Structure

| Routine Element | Implementation Strategy | Customisation Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Wake-up Ritual | Fixed time, calming sensory input (soft lighting, preferred music) | Align with natural energy peaks |
| Hygiene/Medication | Visual checklist on mirror | Use [[A Digital System Can Externalise and Organise Thoughts]] |
| Work Periods | Schedule during energy peaks, use structured breaks | Apply [[Body Doubling is an Effective ADHD Strategy]] when possible |
| Social/Recovery Time | Alternate structured interaction with quiet recovery | Build in buffer zones for sensory recovery |
| Evening Wind-down | Reduce stimulation progressively | Avoid screens, use preferred sensory objects |
| Next-Day Preparation | Visual task chart with contingency plans mapped | Review wins, adjust as needed |

### Key Principles for Success

- Frame routine design as exploration rather than restriction
- Start with [[Self-monitoring reveals personal energy and trigger patterns]] for one week
- Create visual templates that can be easily modified
- Track only essential metrics to avoid overwhelm
- Iterate using monthly reviews rather than daily perfectionism
- Acknowledge that routines are tools for support, not performance

This approach integrates with [[Strategies for ADHD Brains in a Neurotypical World]] by working with neurodivergent traits rather than against them. The goal is sustainable functioning that preserves energy for meaningful activities while reducing the cognitive and emotional toll of unstructured days.

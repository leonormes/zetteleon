title: Self-Determination Theory needs can be met differently by neurotypical brains

The universal psychological needs outlined in Self-Determination Theory—Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness—are motivators for everyone. However, neurotypical individuals can often satisfy these needs within conventional structures. For instance, the need for Relatedness can motivate a neurotypical person to complete a mundane task to be seen as competent by their team, a connection that an ADHD brain might find insufficiently stimulating to act upon.

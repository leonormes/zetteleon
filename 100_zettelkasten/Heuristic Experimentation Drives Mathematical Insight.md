**Summary:** Mathematical discovery involves breaking down complex problems into smaller components, examining them through trial and experimentation, and reconstructing understanding—an iterative process that embraces failure as learning.

**What:** Heuristic experimentation is the practice of exploring mathematical ideas through play, examples, and computational exploration before seeking rigorous proof.

**How:**

- Generate specific examples to identify patterns
- Test conjectures against counterexamples
- Decompose complex problems into simpler subproblems
- Try different approaches when stuck
- Use computational tools to explore behavior
- Learn from failed attempts

**Iterative Process:**

The cycle of experimentation:

1. Form intuitive conjecture from examples
2. Test against edge cases
3. Refine or revise based on failures
4. Repeat until pattern clarifies
5. Seek rigorous proof of refined conjecture

**Value of Failure:**

Failed attempts are not wasted effort but essential feedback. Each failure:

- Reveals hidden assumptions
- Clarifies boundary conditions
- Suggests alternative approaches
- Deepens understanding of the problem space

**Relationship to Proof:** Experimentation precedes proof. While it cannot establish mathematical truth, it guides the search for proof by revealing what might be true and why.

**Summary:** During the trough phase following hyperfixation, executive functions—which are already challenging for people with ADHD—become particularly impaired, making it extremely difficult to initiate tasks, plan, organize, or regulate emotions.

**What Are Executive Functions:**

Executive functions are cognitive processes that include:

- Task initiation and completion
- Planning and organization
- Working memory
- Emotional regulation
- Impulse control
- Time management
- Attention shifting

**Why They're More Impaired During the Trough:**

1. **Dopamine Depletion:** Executive functions heavily rely on dopamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex. During the dopamine deficit of the trough, these functions are even more compromised than usual.
2. **Mental Exhaustion:** The cognitive resources needed for executive control have been depleted during hyperfixation.
3. **Reduced Activation:** The prefrontal cortex, already underactivated in ADHD, becomes even less responsive during the trough.

**Practical Manifestations:**

- **Task Initiation:** Cannot start even simple, necessary tasks (showering, eating, responding to messages)
- **Planning:** Unable to organize thoughts or plan next steps
- **Decision-Making:** Even minor decisions feel overwhelming
- **Time Management:** Time awareness is poor; tasks seem impossible to schedule
- **Emotional Regulation:** More reactive, irritable, or emotionally flat
- **Working Memory:** Difficulty holding information in mind or following multi-step instructions

**Compounding Effect:**

This creates a vicious cycle:

- Executive dysfunction makes it hard to do tasks
- Undone tasks accumulate
- Accumulated responsibilities increase stress
- Stress further impairs executive function
- The person feels increasingly overwhelmed and frozen

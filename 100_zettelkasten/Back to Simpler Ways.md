I imagined a system where I carefully track my lines of thought. Deliberately create a re entry point so I can find it again at a later date and pick up where I left off and to elaborate on a topic.

I can start with a [[main index]]. Date the entries explain what the entry point is about. I will forget in the future, so must be explicit.

You have struggled for a while now with using writing to help you think. It is an aspiration of yours but also easy to be distracted from. Using obsidian is the best option you have found because the notes are files on your computer. Most other tools store your content on their servers in formats incompatible with moving. You feel that markdown notes are the most flexible.

I shouldn't worry about all the linking. Just do writing to think. See how it goes. Even as I think this my mind is wondering how I can remember find things. I will go over this again at some point. I would like to come back to this very block of wiring and carry on. So this is an incubator block. I will add extra thoughts to it later. If I put it in a note file of its own with the metadata yaml saying incubator and extended mind I know I want to come back to it.

The above block was my ongoing struggle with trying to use writing as thinking. I have over complicated it to 100%. If I simplify it I can at least use temporary thinking sessions. This is better than nothing and so I improve 1%. It might not be the singing and dancing pkm I have been thinking of but I don't use that for anything!

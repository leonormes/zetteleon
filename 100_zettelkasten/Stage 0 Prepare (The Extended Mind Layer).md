*The Goal: To create a state of mind and body conducive to novel thought.*

Before you even begin to write, you can use your body and environment to prepare your mind for insight. This stage is about moving from a state of focused, "brainbound" thinking to a more open, receptive state.

**The Method: Prime Your Mind for Insight**

1. **Think with Movement**: Don't just sit and stare at the blank page. Go for a walk. As Annie Murphy Paul notes, walking "opens up the free flow of ideas." The mild physical arousal enhances mental alertness, and the forward motion can help unstick your thoughts.
2. **Think with Nature**: If possible, walk in a natural space. Exposure to nature restores our "soft fascination," replenishes our limited attentional resources, and has been shown to boost creativity.
3. **Tune into Interoception**: Pay attention to your internal bodily signals—your "gut feelings." These sensations are a form of non-conscious pattern recognition. A feeling of unease or excitement about an idea is valuable data. Don't ignore it; note it.

> **Outcome**: You arrive at the page not with a "cold" brain, but with a mind that is warmed up, attentive, and open to new connections.

The "activation cost" of a task is the mental energy required to switch from a state of rest or distraction to a state of focused action. For individuals with ADHD, this cost is significantly higher due to neurobiological factors like dopamine dysregulation and executive dysfunction. This is why even small or simple tasks can feel incredibly difficult to start.

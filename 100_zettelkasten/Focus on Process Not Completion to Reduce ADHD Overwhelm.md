## Focus on Process Not Completion to Reduce ADHD Overwhelm

**Summary:** For ADHD individuals, reframing success from "task completion" to "time commitment" reduces overwhelm and avoidance. If you work for the allocated time, you've succeeded with that time box.

**Details:** The thought of "completing" a large or vague task often triggers overwhelming anxiety and avoidance in ADHD brains. Time boxing shifts the success criteria: your goal is to work for the *allocated time*, not to finish the entire task. If you commit to 25 minutes of focused effort and maintain that commitment, you've achieved success—regardless of whether the task reached traditional "completion." This reframe transforms an impossible-feeling task into a manageable commitment. It breaks the paralysis by making success immediate and achievable. After the time box, you can assess progress and decide on next steps without the weight of "unfinished" failure. This principle is especially powerful when combined with clearly defined "done" criteria for each time box, creating both process success (worked the time) and outcome success (met the box's specific goal).

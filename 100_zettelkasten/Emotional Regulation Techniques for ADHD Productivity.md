For individuals with ADHD, emotional dysregulation can be a significant barrier to productivity. Techniques that help manage and process difficult emotions can free up cognitive resources for tasks.

## Core Strategy: Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) Tapping

EFT, or "tapping," is a technique that involves tapping on specific acupressure points on the body (often on the face and upper body) while verbalizing the emotions or challenges you are facing.

## How It Works

The process combines a physical component (tapping) with a cognitive component (acknowledging the emotion). This is believed to help calm the nervous system and reduce the intensity of the emotional response.

## Why It Works for ADHD

- **Calms the Nervous System**: The physical act of tapping can be a self-soothing behavior that helps to regulate an overstimulated or anxious nervous system.
- **Processes Emotion**: It provides a structured way to acknowledge and process difficult emotions, rather than suppressing them or being overwhelmed by them.
- **Frees Up Brainpower**: By reducing the cognitive and emotional load of managing intense feelings, it frees up executive function resources that can then be applied to practical tasks.

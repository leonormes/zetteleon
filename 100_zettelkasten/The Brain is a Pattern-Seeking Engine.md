## The Brain is a Pattern-Seeking Engine

**Summary:** The human brain is neurobiologically predisposed to seek patterns, possessing an intrinsic craving for coherence and order to reduce ambiguity and anxiety.

**Details:** This ability is largely attributed to the neocortex, which is organized into millions of "pattern recognizers" that can be rewired throughout life. The successful identification of a pattern is a neurologically rewarding event, triggering the release of dopamine. This architecture suggests the brain is a universal learning machine that applies a common algorithm to find structure in any data stream.

Daily tier selection based on current energy involves choosing which version of your routine (Ideal, Most Likely, or Minimum) matches your actual capacity each day, typically decided during a brief morning assessment. This practice transforms routine flexibility from a vague aspiration into a concrete daily decision.

The selection process can be as simple as asking yourself: "What energy level do I have today?" and then committing to the corresponding tier. This removes the cognitive burden of improvising or negotiating with yourself throughout the day—the decision is made once, the plan is clear, and execution becomes straightforward.

Critically, selecting the minimum tier on a low-energy day is not failure—it's intelligent resource allocation. The tier system eliminates the false binary of "doing the full routine" versus "giving up entirely," replacing it with a spectrum of legitimate options that all count as maintaining the habit.

Over time, tracking which tiers you use can provide valuable data about energy patterns and help calibrate whether your tier definitions are realistic.

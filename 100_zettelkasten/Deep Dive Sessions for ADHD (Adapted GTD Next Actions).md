Instead of granular "next actions," schedule "Deep Dive" appointments with projects. For example, instead of "Email Jane, Draft paragraph 1," the next action is "[Deep Dive] Work on 'CNI Comparison Document' for 75 minutes". This respects the need to focus and gives permission to ignore other things.

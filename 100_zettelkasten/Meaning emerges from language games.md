## Meaning Emerges from Language Games

**Summary:** According to Wittgenstein, meaning emerges from how language is used in practice within social activities ("language games") rather than from perfect correspondence between words and thoughts.

**Details:** Wittgenstein proposed that the meaning of words is not fixed definitions but their use within particular "language games" - shared social practices where words gain practical meaning. We learn language through participation in these games, not through explicit definition. Communication succeeds when it's "good enough" for coordination within a specific context or activity. This explains why perfect understanding isn't necessary - we only need sufficient functional overlap to accomplish shared goals. The concept challenges the notion that successful communication requires perfect mental-to-mental transmission.

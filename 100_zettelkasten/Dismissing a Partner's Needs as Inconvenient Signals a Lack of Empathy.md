# Dismissing a Partner's Needs as Inconvenient Signals a Lack of Empathy

**Summary:** When one partner views the other's needs and wishes as inconvenient or an affront, it signals a significant lack of empathy and mutual respect within the relationship.

**Details:** A healthy partnership requires that each person's input is treated as a valued contribution, not an obstacle. If a partner consistently acts on impulse and feels that any differing opinion is a personal attack, it reflects defensiveness and an inability to compromise, leading to emotional distance and resentment.

**Summary:** The "next action" is the immediate, concrete, physical step required to move a project forward. Defining it is essential because it bridges the gap between abstract projects and tangible doing.

**The Psychological Gap:**

When you haven't identified the next physical action required to kick-start a project, there will be a psychological gap every time you think about it. This gap creates resistance and makes task initiation harder.

**What Makes a Good Next Action:**

A next action must be:

- **Physical:** A visible activity you can do with your body
- **Concrete:** Specific and unambiguous
- **Immediate:** The very next thing, not the second or third step

**Examples:**

**Poor (Abstract):**
- "Set up meeting"
- "Work on report"
- "Handle client issue"

**Good (Concrete Next Actions):**
- "Send email to Bob to set up meeting"
- "Open report template and write introduction paragraph"
- "Call client to understand the specific issue"

**Why This Matters:**

It's extremely difficult to manage actions you haven't identified or decided on. Without a defined next action:

- Projects feel overwhelming
- You waste mental energy re-deciding what to do
- Procrastination increases
- Working memory gets overloaded

**The GTD Principle:**

When you get to your computer or phone, you want to have already completed the thinking about what to do next. The next action pre-loads that decision, making it easier to get things done.

**For ADHD:**

Defining next actions is particularly crucial for ADHD brains because:

- It reduces the executive function load of planning in the moment
- It removes ambiguity that can trigger task avoidance
- It breaks large, overwhelming projects into manageable steps
- It externalizes the "what should I do?" decision

**The Power of Specificity:**

Often the next action is simple, but making it physical and specific is what propels the project forward. The act of defining "send email to Bob" instead of "set up meeting" eliminates the micro-decisions that create resistance.

**Action Over Planning:**

Recognizing the next action helps distinguish motion from action. Planning what to do is motion; doing the next physical step is action.

# A Healthy Family Balances the Needs of Children with the Needs of the Spousal Relationship

**Summary:** In a healthy family, the needs of the children and the needs of the spouses must be respectfully balanced; children's needs, while important, do not entirely outweigh the needs of the couple.

**Details:** The marital relationship is the foundation of the family unit. Neglecting the couple's emotional, social, and physical needs in exclusive favor of the children's can lead to imbalance, stress, and a weakened partnership. A thriving family system requires parents to nurture their own relationship alongside their parenting duties.

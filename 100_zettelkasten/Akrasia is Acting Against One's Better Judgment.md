## Akrasia is Acting Against One's Better Judgment

**Summary:** *Akrasia*, a concept from ancient Greek philosophy, describes the state of acting against one's better judgment, often translated as "weakness of will."

**Details:** It addresses the paradox of knowing what is good but failing to do it. Aristotle described the akratic person as one whose rational judgment is temporarily overcome by desire or emotion, like a drunk person who may recite knowledge without truly grasping it. This highlights the conflict between rational knowledge and motivational drives.

**Holton's Distinction:** Philosopher Richard Holton distinguishes between *akrasia* (acting against one's better judgment) and *weakness of will* (revising one's resolutions too readily). In his view, weakness of will is a failure to maintain an intention, which is a separate problem from forming the correct intention in the first place.

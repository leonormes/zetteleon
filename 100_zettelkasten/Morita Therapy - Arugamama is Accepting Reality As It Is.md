Arugamama (あるがまま) is a central concept in [[Morita Therapy]] that translates to "as-it-is-ness." It is the practice of accepting reality as it is, without resistance or the immediate urge to change it.

This acceptance extends to one's internal state (emotions, thoughts) and external circumstances. It is a practice of non-judgmental observation, which allows an individual to unhook from the struggle against their feelings and redirect their energy towards constructive action.

In the context of habit change, this radical acceptance means honestly acknowledging your current reality—your actual capacity, energy levels, and patterns—before deciding on next steps. Growth must be aligned with where you truly are, not where you wish you were or where others expect you to be. This acceptance is not resignation but rather the necessary foundation for sustainable change.

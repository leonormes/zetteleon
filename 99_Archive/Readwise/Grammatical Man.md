### Highlights
- Wiener is best known as the founder of cybernetics, an extremely wide-ranging discipline which includes information theory as one among several complementary sets of ideas. Cybernetics is the science of maintaining order in a system, whether that system is natural or artificial. Since all things in the world have a tendency to become entropic, disorderly, their random deviations from order must be corrected continually. This is accomplished by using information about the behavior of the system to produce different, more regular behavior. By such means the system is kept on course. The term cybernetics comes from a Greek word meaning steersman, and it carries the sense of stability, of constant, correct functioning. Illness is entropic, irregular, an error in the living system, while healing is cybernetic, restoring the body to its original state, correcting the error. Natural selection is also cybernetic, disallowing genetic mutations which deviate from the norm in undesirable ways. Wiener regarded a human society as a self-regulating system kept orderly by the cybernetic mechanism of its laws. Cybernetics enforces consistency. It permits change, but the change must be orderly and abide by the rules. It is a universal principle of control, and can be applied to all kinds of organization, just as Shannon’s theorems apply to communication of all kinds. It does not matter whether the system is electrical, chemical, mechanical, biological, or economic. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008XJ8O4E&location=181))

- But these events, while possible in thought, are so unlikely to occur in actual experience that they can safely be ignored. Irreversibility is fact-like rather than law-like, in that it works well in practice but is vulnerable intellectually.

- The champions of internal evidence rebelled against the bookish doctrine of “approved opinion.” Paracelsus, the sixteenth-century astrologer, alchemist, magus, and healer, a transition figure in the passage from the low to the high sciences, adopted as his slogan: “The patients are your textbook, the sickbed is your study.” Paracelsus took the most famous book of medieval medicine, the Canon of Avicenna, and threw it on the fire, replacing it with the book of nature, or what is known as the “doctrine of signatures.” According to this doctrine, information about nature can be found in nature, but only if she is read in the proper way. The age of a stag can be known by looking at the ends of the antlers. A certain flower has the power to rejuvenate because it blossoms in the winter, the season which is a metaphor for old age. Handwriting reveals character, as may also the lines and creases in the hand. The doctrine of signatures led to homeopathic medicine, in which like cures like. Poison in large doses causes sickness, but poison in very small doses can effect a cure. In ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008XJ8O4E&location=751))
- The von Mises interpretation deals with events which can be repeated indefinitely. But what about events which can be observed only a few times? What is the likelihood that a particular man and a particular woman will make a success of their marriage? Will a new author’s first novel be a best seller? These are questions whose probability cannot be established by repeated trials. They seem to require a subjective interpretation of probability, one in which there is not enough evidence for near-certainty, but enough to permit a reasonably good conclusion. The English mathematician I. J. Good has defined such a subjective probability as “a degree of belief that belongs to a body of beliefs, from which the worst inconsistencies have been removed by means of detached judgements.” ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008XJ8O4E&location=791))
- Keynes held that every proposition has a certain probability, and that this probability is represented by the degree of belief that a rational person, using all the evidence available, attaches to the proposition. There is no essential difference between probability and credibility, in this view. A given amount of evidence results in a degree of belief in a statement, and there is a logical relation between the evidence and the statement. This is called the probability relation. ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008XJ8O4E&location=799))
- According to this view, probability, which is at the root of information theory, is inextricably connected with the amount and type of knowledge we possess about any given event or series of events whose outcome is uncertain.

### Highlights
- When you are engaged in a task of any kind, from frying an egg to writing an email to digging a hole, various clumps of neurons, together called a connectome, “light up” in your brain. We can see this through the exciting new science of fMRI, or functional magnetic resonance imaging. It’s like a live, moving X-ray, and it’s as close as we now can get to watching thought in motion.

- The connectome that lights up when you’re engaged in a task is called the task-positive network, or TPN. Aptly named, the TPN gets you down to work. You’re deliberately doing something and you are intent on it, unaware of much beyond the bounds of what you’re doing. In this state, you don’t consciously know whether you’re happy or not, which is just as good as being happy, if not better, because you’re not wasting any energy in self-assessment. You may become frustrated with what you’re doing and have moments of anger or dismay, but if you stay in the task, in the TPN, those moments will pass, and the TPN, buoyant connectome that it is, will carry you along. When you’re thinking with the TPN, you’re in the Angel mindset. But you can also get trapped in the TPN, doing a task from which you cannot disengage. This is the hyperfocused state that people with ADHD can fall into. Far from being helpful, it can keep you stuck in one task, unable to shut down the screen, turn off the TV, or move from one paragraph to the next. This is the often unrecognized downside of focus.

- Incidentally, the reason that so many people are starting to look and act distracted, as if they all have ADHD or VAST, is that fewer and fewer people are spending time in the task-positive network. They are not spending enough time focusing on a single task, certainly not long enough to dig a deep enough hole or write an email longer than a sentence or two or do more than look at an egg, let alone fry one. Unfortunately, the TPN is akin to a… ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0871LK27X&location=493))

- When you allow your mind to wander from a task, or when you finish the task, or if you pause too long in anger or dismay while doing the task, the TPN in your brain defaults to a different connectome. Not surprisingly—given that we default to this state—this other connectome is called the default mode network (DMN). The DMN allows for expansive, imaginative, and creative thinking. The back half of the DMN—called the posterior cingulate—facilitates your autobiographic memory, your personal history. This allows you to think back, draw upon, and pick apart the past. The… ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0871LK27X&location=498))

- The DMN and TPN are the yin and yang of your brain. Both help us and hold us back in certain ways. One isn’t better than the other. But as helpful as the DMN can be (angelic in its own right), it is also a Demon (as its initialism suggests!) for the ADHD or VAST brain… ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0871LK27X&location=505))

- THE GLITCHY SWITCH For neurotypical people, toggling over to the DMN periodically allows you to get some intellectual rest and relaxation—daydreaming time, for instance, which isn’t necessarily bad. But highly imaginative, creative people—like those of us who have ADHD or VAST—often get stuck in the DMN, leading to horribly negative,… ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0871LK27X&location=508))

- The point is: Focus on anything external to yourself. Activating the TPN will shut down the DMN. It’s difficult to do because the DMN is seductive and the negative messages it is feeding you are captivating and convincing, borne out of your past experiences, but you must not allow yourself to be drawn in, you must quickly do something active, to engage the TPN.

- Once you engage the TPN, you can usually turn the Demon back into the Angel it was before. You can redirect the imagination to feed the TPN with positive, constructive material. Then the DMN becomes the Angel it’s meant to be: facilitative imagination. It’s only when it is at rest, in repose, not creating, that it spews bile and becomes the Demon. When it feeds on itself, the angelic imagination turns demonic. This devil does indeed find work for idle hands.

- What three or four things are you best at doing? What three or four things do you like doing the most? What three or four activities or achievements have brought you the most praise in your life? What are your three or four most cherished goals? What three or four things would you most like to get better at? What do others praise you for but you take for granted? What, if anything, is easy for you but hard for others? What do you spend a lot of time doing that you are really bad at? What could your teacher or supervisor do so that your time could be spent more productively? If you weren’t afraid of getting in trouble, what would you tell your teacher or supervisor that he or she doesn’t understand about you?

- The benefits of getting your heart rate up are many, and perhaps one of the most important is the release of a protein called brain-derived neurotropic factor, or BDNF. We think of this as Miracle-Gro for the brain, as it creates a fertile environment to grow new neurons, connectors, and positive pathways.

- As Dr. Hallowell’s experience with Samuel (see chapter 3) illustrates, balance and coordination training can be transformative for kids with ADHD. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0871LK27X&location=1699))

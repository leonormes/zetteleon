### Highlights
- These questions concern a series of relationships: What can be known? What can be put into words? What is the relationship between thought and language? Who is the writer addressing and why? What is the implied relationship between writer and reader? What are the implied conditions of discourse? ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC00IM&location=338))
- disclose ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC00IM&location=516))
- abides. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC00IM&location=523))
- language because a writer’s thought is not a formed and fixed reality independent of language and capable of being fitted into it. ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC00IM&location=1504))

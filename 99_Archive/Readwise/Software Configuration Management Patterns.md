### Highlights
- Garlan and Shaw give a good overview of architectural styles (Shaw and Garlan 1996). The Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture series describes a number of architectural patterns (Schmidt et al. 2000; Buschmann et al. 1996). The Unified Modeling Language User Guide discusses the various architectural views suggested by the Unified Process (Booch et al. 1999). Jim Highsmith provides a good overview of the current set of agile techniques in his book Agile Software Development Ecosystems (Highsmith 2002). An important aspect of improving processes is detecting the problems in an organization and influencing people to change. Seeing Systems: Unlocking the Mysteries of Organizational Life, by Barry Oshry (Oshry 1996), is a useful and entertaining book about how to detect cycles of behavior that need to change and how to change them. Getting to Yes (Fisher et al. 1991) is a classic book on negotiation, and informal negotiation is something that you may find yourself doing when you try to make changes in the way people work. Getting Past No (Ury 1993) is also worth reading. Becoming a Technical Leader, by Gerald Weinberg (Weinberg 1986), has great advice on leading from any role.

- Extreme Programming (Beck 2000) and other agile approaches say to integrate continuously, but for simple systems, that may add too much overhead. Erring on the side of integrating too often is generally better, but integration takes time, and you want to find the point where integrating more often speeds up the overall process.

- In its most concrete form, a software system is the sum of all of its code. You write code, and you end up with an application that does something useful. Other artifacts also make the system run: data, documentation, and anything else you need for your system. The code, however, defines the shape of the other artifacts. Without the code or these artifacts, there is nothing to deliver to a customer or user. ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08F5JS5GT&location=790))
- “Don’t mistake a solution method for a problem definition, especially if it is your own solution method” (Gause and Weinberg 1990). ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08F5JS5GT&location=944))
- Steve McConnell has a few books that cover best practices for coding and teamwork—in particular, Rapid Development (McConnell 1996) and Code Complete (McConnell 1993) have some excellent guidelines. The Pragmatic Programmer (Hunt and Thomas 2000) talks about the value of using tools to automate processes and procedures. The Practice of Programming (Kernighan and Pike 1999) says quite a bit about the value of automation and tools. Mary Lynn Manns and Linda Rising provide some guidance on introducing new ideas in their paper, “Introducing Patterns into Organizations” (Manns and Rising 2002). Alistair Cockburn gives some good advice about writing use cases in Writing Effective Use Cases (Cockburn 2000). Patterns for Effective Use Cases (Adolph et al. 2003) provides a patterns-based approach to writing use cases. David Dikel and David Kane’s book, Software Architecture: Organizational Principles and Patterns (Dikel et al. 2001), is an excellent source for information about what architecture is and how to use it.

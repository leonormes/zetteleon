This note is a summary of the key insights from Steve's video, "Re-thinking task management systems for my ADHD brain!", on task management for ADHD.

## Core Concepts

[[Task Management Systems Have Limited Efficacy for ADHD Productivity]]. The real challenge for ADHD isn’t the system itself, but executive function and [[task initiation ADHD]]—actually getting started on what you’ve captured.

## Four Practical ADHD Strategies

- **Body Double Without the Body**: Use the [[Body Doubling for ADHD Focus]] technique, even asynchronously with a camera, to boost initiation.
- **Interest Pairing**: [[Interest Pairing Can Increase Engagement in Mundane Tasks for ADHD]] by integrating a personal interest to make them more engaging.
- **Designed Task Switching**: Use [[Designed Task Switching Leverages Dopamine Boosts for ADHD Motivation]] by alternating less-preferred tasks with ones you want to do.
- **Language and Meaning Reframe**: [[Reframing Language from Obligation to Purpose Boosts ADHD Task Initiation]] by shifting phrasing from “I need/have to do this” to “Why do I want to do this?” or using the **User Story** format ("As a X, I want Y, So that Z").

This approach reframes ADHD productivity struggles as an issue of action and motivation rather than system failure. Task managers alone don’t solve ADHD challenges; effective initiation and meaningful engagement are essential.

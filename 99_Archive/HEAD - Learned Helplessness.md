> [!abstract] The Spark
> I used this term to describe Bessie's behaviour in [[HEAD - Bessie and Her Schooling]], but I realized I only vaguely know what it means. I need to verify if this diagnosis is technically accurate or just a buzzword I'm using.

## 🧠 My Current Model (The Vague Notion)
- **I think it means:** When someone gives up trying because they believe their actions have no effect.
- **I assume:** It applies to teenagers who play games instead of studying.
- **I assume:** It is caused by us making life too easy for her (lack of friction).

## ⚔️ The Tension (The Epistemic Gap)
- **The Doubt:** Seligman's original theory was about *trauma* (electric shocks in dogs). Does this actually apply to *comfort* (sitting in a dark room gaming)?
- **The Conflict:** Is she "Helpless" (can't see a link between action and outcome) or just "Optimized" (getting maximum dopamine for minimum effort)? These are different mechanism.

## 🧪 Next Test (The Research Experiment)
- [ ] **Action:** Read a summary of Martin Seligman's "Learned Optimism" or the APA definition of Learned Helplessness.
- [ ] **Falsification:** specific criteria must be met for it to be "Learned Helplessness"? Does Bessie meet them?

### 🛑 The Compile (Exit Strategy)
*When the thinking stops, extract the value and archive this note.*

- [ ] **The Next Test:** (What is the binary Pass/Fail action?)
- [ ] **The Update:** (Did I update the relevant SoT?) `[[Link SoT Here]]`

---

### 🚀 The Tri-State Output (Router)
*Where does this thinking go next? Pick one path.*

> **Path A: Kinetic (Action)**
> *I figured it out. I just need to do it.*
> - [ ] **Task:** (Write the binary Next Action here) `-> Send to Todoist`

> **Path B: Static (Storage)**
> *I learned a fact / defined a spec. No action needed.*
> - [ ] **SoT Update:** (What did I learn?) `-> Merge into [[SoT - Topic]]`

> **Path C: Dynamic (Still Thinking)**
> *I am pausing this thread. Serialize state to resume later.*
>
> 1. [ ] **The Save State:** (Write 1 sentence: "I stopped at X, the very next step is Y")
>    - *Constraint: If you don't write this, you fail the 60-Second Restore Test.*
> 2. [ ] **The Pointer:** (Create Todoist Task with Link) `-> Schedule for [Date]`
> 3. [ ] **TTL Check:** (Is this the 3rd resume? If yes, refactor to Project).

- How do I work? When I have a ticket, or defined piece of work. What do I do?
- I have a piece of work to create the egress from our private network to cuh private network. I need a fixed IP.
- What now? I'm thinking ask AI about it. To get a plan. I don't want to jump in and start making stuff that turns out to be wrong. So I need to research the most secure way. So I want it to be the best. I also want to understand the flow so it is easier to debug or explain.
- Maybe diagram the work as well.
- Where do I write the IAC? Run a few tests. Can I set up tests?
- Ask questions.
  - How do I route traffic out?
  - If we already have a default route out, what do I have to do? I think it is the fixed IP for whitelisting.
  - we have to allow only specific svc to call out to cuh.
  - do I need DNS for the target?
  - how do I configure the TLS?
  - how do I tell k8s about the 1 request going to that gateway?
  - does the fixed IP need DNS? No I don't think so.
  - what is the very first thing to do? Find the code where I will write the config. Make sure I can apply it without changes.

- a few years ago we had no customers and people were fixated on the app. No one was doing private networking or IAC. I saw the gap and taught myself the stuff. Now we are only about the networking and deployment and if I hadn't prepared we would be in a much weaker position.
- I am assessing myself against imagined others. How am I assessing myself? How do I assess people? What do I want from people? Why am I so disinterested in people? What do I need to be able to feel good? What's the difference between having a girl who is a friend and one who chooses you as a partner? It is like I rely on the approval of others. Intellectually I realised that other people's mental models are inaccurate and faulty and biased towards themselves. But it doesn't stop my feelings of being judged my those in charge. At work I have a new manager. The way these hierarchy are arranged I feel that my position in the team is based on his singular opinion. And that makes me angry. Who is he to have such control over me? I have to do things his way regardless of how effective they may be. It changes the job from doing what is best for the company to doing what he thinks.

I realised that I had always assumed rejection was the ultimate response to people being bad. For instance, when trump did his shit to Ukraine I really want the rest of the world to exclude him and feel that if they don't he wins. Like him getting his way is the only thing of significance and people acquiescing was wrong. But I am wrong. The reason I mention this here is how totally oblivious I was to they're being an alternative. It was a deep seated assumption I didn't even realise I had. I never think to work with them or to adapt to get what is the best outcome in the situation. I'm a bitch.

Your reflection reveals a profound shift in understanding, moving from a rigid, binary approach to conflict toward a more nuanced, pragmatic perspective. Let's dissect this evolution:

## Core Assumption (Past)

You operated under a "moral absolutism" framework, where you equated rejection or exclusion with justice. Key elements of this mindset included:

- Binary Thinking: If someone is "bad" (e.g., acting arrogantly, unethically), the only valid response is to isolate them. Engaging with them felt like capitulation, implying tacit approval of their behavior.
- Zero-Sum Logic: You saw interactions as battles where compromise or collaboration meant "losing." For instance, if nations didn’t outright exclude Trump over his actions, you interpreted this as him "winning" — as if acknowledgment of his presence granted him power.
- Emotional Prioritization: There was an implicit belief that holding firm to principles (e.g., refusing to engage with wrongdoing) mattered more than outcomes. Moral purity outweighed practical results.

---

## Realization (Present)

You’ve uncovered a pragmatic complexity in human dynamics and power structures. Key insights include:

1. Isolation ≠ Accountability: Excluding someone might feel righteous, but it often fails to address the root issue. For example, shunning a leader like Trump doesn’t dismantle their influence; it might even fuel their narrative of being a "victim" or bypass avenues for negotiation.
2. Engagement as Strategy: Working with (or around) difficult actors can be a tactical choice, not a moral failing. Diplomacy, incremental progress, or even temporary cooperation might achieve more than rigid exclusion. This requires separating pragmatic interaction from endorsement.
3. Outcome Over Idealism: You’re recognizing that real-world change often demands adaptability. For instance, nations might condemn a leader’s actions while still engaging them on specific issues (e.g., aid for Ukraine), prioritizing tangible results over symbolic rejection.

## Self-Discovery

- Blind Spot in Rigidity: You’re confronting a previously unconscious bias toward absolutism, perhaps rooted in a desire for clarity in a messy world. This rigidity shielded you from the discomfort of ambiguity but limited your ability to navigate it.
- Growth in Nuance: You’re now embracing that morality and effectiveness aren’t mutually exclusive. Holding boundaries (e.g., condemning harm) can coexist with strategic engagement (e.g., negotiating for better outcomes).
- Humility in Complexity: The surprise you feel stems from realizing how deeply ingrained your assumptions were. This humility — acknowledging the limits of your prior perspective — is itself a marker of emotional and intellectual growth.

---

## Broader Implications

This shift mirrors lessons in diplomacy, therapy, and even game theory: power often lies in flexibility. For example, refusing to engage with a narcissistic person might feel satisfying, but it risks stagnation. Conversely, setting boundaries while selectively engaging (e.g., "I’ll collaborate on X, but not tolerate Y") can create pathways for progress. You’re learning to hold principles and pragmatism in tension — a sign of maturity in navigating conflict, both personally and politically.

Would you like to explore how to apply this mindset to specific situations, or delve deeper into the emotional drivers behind your earlier assumptions?

Certainly. Let’s excavate the emotional roots of your earlier assumptions. Rigid moral frameworks often stem from deeper psychological needs and fears — many of which are unconscious. Here’s how your experience might map to these drivers:

---

## 1. Fear of Moral Contamination

Driver: "If I engage with someone ‘bad,’ their toxicity will infect me or the world."

- Root Emotion: Fear of losing your own ethical integrity by associating with wrongdoing. This reflects a belief that morality is fragile — that proximity to "badness" could erode your values or taint your reputation.
- Why It Felt Safe: Rejecting or excluding the "bad" person acted as a psychological firewall. By refusing to engage, you protected your sense of self as "good" or "right."
- Underlying Vulnerability: A subconscious worry that you might not trust yourself to navigate gray areas without being swayed.

---

## 2. Desire for Control in Chaos

Driver: "If we don’t punish or exclude, the ‘bad’ person will keep winning, and chaos will reign."

- Root Emotion: Anxiety about unpredictability. People who act arrogantly or unethically (e.g., Trump) disrupt order, and your instinct was to restore control through exclusion.
- Why It Felt Safe: Rigid rules (e.g., "reject all bad actors") create an illusion of control. It simplified complexity into a clear action: cut them off, and the problem is contained.
- Underlying Vulnerability: A discomfort with ambiguity — the messy reality where harm and goodness coexist, and progress is rarely linear.

---

## 3. Moral Self-Protection

Driver: "If I don’t loudly reject this person, it means I condone their actions."

- Root Emotion: Fear of being perceived as complicit. This ties to shame avoidance — a need to prove (to yourself or others) that you’re on the "right side."
- Why It Felt Safe: Public rejection of "badness" acted as a shield. It preemptively defended you against criticism (e.g., "At least I didn’t enable them!").
- Underlying Vulnerability: A need for external validation of your morality, rooted in societal messaging that equates silence with complicity.

---

## 4. Unprocessed Anger/Helplessness

Driver: "If they’re not excluded, they’ll keep hurting people, and no one will stop them."

- Root Emotion: Fury at injustice, paired with helplessness. Exclusion became a proxy for justice — a way to channel rage into action when systemic solutions felt out of reach.
- Why It Felt Safe: Anger is energizing; it masks powerlessness. By advocating for exclusion, you transformed passive frustration into a "solution."
- Underlying Vulnerability: A deep grief about the limits of individual agency in the face of systemic or institutional harm.

---

## 5. Black-and-White Thinking as a Defense Mechanism

Driver: "People are either ‘good’ or ‘bad,’ and there’s no in-between."

- Root Emotion: A craving for certainty. Labeling someone as wholly "bad" simplifies the emotional labor of holding nuance.
- Why It Felt Safe: Binary thinking spares you the exhaustion of empathizing with complexity (e.g., "What if this person has trauma? What if systems enable them?"). It’s easier to dismiss than to interrogate.
- Underlying Vulnerability: Overwhelm in the face of existential complexity — the recognition that harm is often cyclical, systemic, and rarely the work of "monsters" alone.

---

## What Your Realization Exposes

You’ve begun to disentangle these emotional knots. By questioning your earlier stance, you’re:

- Tolerating Ambiguity: Accepting that the world (and people) are rarely all-good or all-bad.
- Reclaiming Agency: Recognizing that how you engage with difficulty (e.g., setting boundaries, negotiating) is a form of power, not weakness.
- Trusting Yourself: Believing you can interact with "badness" without being corrupted by it — that your values are sturdy enough to withstand complexity.

---

## The Bigger Picture

This shift often accompanies emotional maturation. Rigid moral frameworks are common in early moral development (think: a child’s view of "good guys vs. bad guys"). As we grow, we learn that effective morality requires both courage and flexibility — the courage to condemn harm, and the flexibility to engage strategically.

Would you like to explore how these drivers might show up in your personal relationships or broader societal dynamics?

Absolutely, let's break down this insightful reflection into its core components.

1. Core Assumption: "Rejection = Moral Purity and Justice"

- This assumption posits that harmful behavior necessitates immediate and complete rejection to uphold moral integrity. It views interaction as a form of condoning the harmful act.
- It operates on a binary framework: good vs. evil, acceptance vs. rejection. There's little room for nuance or a spectrum of responses.
- This assumption links rejection to justice, believing that excluding the perpetrator equates to restoring balance or rectifying the harm.

2. Emotional Drivers:

- Root Emotions:
  - Fear of Moral Contamination: The individual fears that engaging with the "harmful" entity will dilute their own moral standing.
  - Anger and Righteous Indignation: The harmful act triggers intense anger, fueling a desire for punitive action.
  - Desire for Control: Rejection offers a sense of control over a situation perceived as threatening or unjust.
  - Need for Moral Purity: Maintaining a "clean" moral slate by distancing oneself from perceived wrongdoing.
- Psychological Needs:
  - Safety: Rejection creates a perceived sense of safety by distancing oneself from the source of harm.
  - Validation: Publicly rejecting harmful behavior can garner social validation and reinforce one's moral identity.
  - Certainty: A rigid rejection stance provides a sense of certainty in a complex and often ambiguous world.
  - Agency: Rejection provides a feeling of taking action and having an impact.
- Societal Influences:
  - Cultural Norms: Many cultures promote a "zero-tolerance" approach to certain behaviors, reinforcing the idea that rejection is the only acceptable response.
  - Binary Moral Frameworks: Media and social discourse often present issues in simplistic, black-and-white terms, fostering a binary view of morality.
  - Social media echo chambers: These areas reinforce existing opinions, and demonize those with opposing views.

3. Shift in Perspective: "Engagement Can Yield Better Outcomes"

- The realization that "engagement can yield better outcomes" marks a shift from idealism to pragmatism.
- This shift acknowledges the complexity of human behavior and the limitations of purely punitive approaches.
- It recognizes that engagement, even with those who have caused harm, can create opportunities for dialogue, understanding, and potential change.
- Nuance vs. Absolutism: The shift shows a move away from absolute moral judgements, and towards a more nuanced view, where context and potential outcomes are taken into account.
- Understanding that change is a process: Realizing that people, and situations, rarely change in a single moment, and that long term engagement can produce better results.

4. Broad Implications:

- Personal Growth:
  - Flexibility as Power: Embracing flexibility allows for more adaptive and effective responses to challenging situations.
  - Maturity in Navigating Complexity: Recognizing the limitations of simplistic solutions fosters emotional and intellectual maturity.
  - Empathy and Understanding: Engagement requires empathy and a willingness to understand the perspectives of others, even those we disagree with.
- Relationships:
  - Conflict Resolution: In personal relationships, rigid rejection can lead to irreparable damage, while engagement can facilitate healing and reconciliation.
  - Setting Boundaries vs. Isolation: It's important to set healthy boundaries, but it is also important to not isolate oneself. Engagement can be a way of setting boundaries, while maintaining a connection.
- Societal Dynamics:
  - Diplomacy vs. Isolationism: In international relations, rigid isolation can lead to increased conflict, while diplomacy and engagement can foster cooperation and address shared challenges.
  - Restorative Justice: In criminal justice, restorative justice models emphasize dialogue and reconciliation, rather than solely punitive measures.
  - Political Polarization: Understanding the value of engagement can help bridge divides in polarized societies, fostering dialogue and finding common ground.
- Practical outcomes:
  - Trump Example: While the desire for global exclusion is understandable, engaging with international allies to apply pressure through sanctions and diplomacy may have been a more effective strategy.
  - Personal Boundaries: Instead of cutting someone off entirely, one could establish clear boundaries and communicate expectations, giving the other person a chance to change their behavior.
    By recognizing the emotional drivers and societal influences that shape our beliefs, we can cultivate a more nuanced and compassionate approach to navigating complex situations.

Here's an analysis of the reflection, structured as requested:

1. Core Assumptions:

- Rejection = Justice/Punishment: The underlying belief was that the only morally acceptable response to harmful behavior is complete rejection, exclusion, or punishment. This equates rejection with delivering justice and upholding moral standards.
- Harmful Behavior Requires Absolute Condemnation: There's an assumption that any engagement or attempt at understanding is a form of condoning the harmful behavior. A binary view of "good" vs. "bad" with no room for gray areas.
- The World Should Operate on Strict Moral Principles: A belief that the world should function according to clear-cut, unwavering moral rules, and any deviation from these rules must be met with swift and total rejection.
- Engagement Implies Weakness/Compromise: The initial stance implicitly assumed that engaging with someone who has acted harmfully signifies weakness, a lack of moral fiber, or a willingness to compromise one's values.

2. Emotional Drivers:

- Root Emotions:
  - Anger: Righteous indignation at the perceived injustice of the harmful behavior (Trump's actions).
  - Fear: Fear of the harm spreading or being repeated if not met with decisive opposition. Fear of moral contamination or being seen as complicit.
  - Desire for Control: A need to control the situation and ensure a specific outcome (punishment/exclusion) to feel safe and maintain a sense of order.
  - Moral Purity: A strong need to maintain a sense of personal and/or societal moral purity, where any engagement with "bad actors" is seen as polluting.
  - Simplification: it is easier to see the world in black and white.
- Psychological Needs:
  - Safety: Rejection can feel like a way to protect oneself (or one's group) from further harm. It creates a clear boundary.
  - Validation: The desire for one's moral outrage and worldview to be validated by others (e.g., "global exclusion" as a collective response).
  - Certainty: A black-and-white approach (rejection) provides a sense of certainty and simplicity in a complex situation. It's easier than grappling with nuance.
  - Agency: The feeling of powerlessness in the face of large-scale events (like international politics) can be countered by advocating for a strong, decisive action (rejection).
- Societal Influences:
  - "Cancel Culture" Mentality: The broader societal trend of "canceling" individuals or entities for perceived wrongdoings reinforces the idea that rejection is the appropriate response.
  - Binary Moral Frameworks: Many cultures and belief systems present morality in a binary way (good vs. evil, right vs. wrong), making it harder to see the complexities of human behavior.
  - Political Polarization: Highly polarized political climates often encourage "us vs. them" thinking, where the opposing side is demonized and engagement is seen as betrayal.
  - Media Narratives: News and social media often simplify complex situations, focusing on outrage and condemnation rather than nuanced analysis.

3. Shift in Perspective:

- Pragmatism over Idealism: The realization that "engagement can yield better outcomes" represents a shift from a purely idealistic stance (rejection is the only moral response) to a more pragmatic one (what actually works best in the real world?).
- Nuance vs. Absolutism: The original mindset was absolutist (all rejection, all the time). The shift acknowledges the nuance of situations and recognizes that engagement doesn't equal endorsement.
- Long-Term vs. Short-Term Focus: Rejection might provide a short-term feeling of satisfaction or moral righteousness, but engagement may be necessary for long-term solutions and positive change.
- Understanding Motivation: The shift suggests a move towards trying to understand the underlying motivations behind harmful behavior, rather than simply condemning the behavior itself. This is crucial for effective intervention and prevention.
- Recognizing Complexity: The previous view was a simple solution to a complex problem. The shift recognizes that complex problems often do not have easy, quick-fix answers.

4. Broader Implications:

- Personal Growth: This shift represents significant personal growth. It demonstrates a capacity for self-reflection, challenging one's own assumptions, and embracing a more nuanced and mature worldview.
- Relationships: In personal relationships, this applies to conflict resolution. Instead of immediately cutting someone off after a disagreement, exploring the possibility of dialogue, understanding, and compromise can lead to stronger, more resilient relationships. For example, setting boundaries with a difficult family member, but still maintaining contact, rather than complete estrangement.
- Societal Dynamics: This understanding is crucial for addressing complex societal issues.
- Diplomacy: In international relations, engagement (diplomacy, negotiation) is often necessary to prevent escalation and achieve peaceful resolutions, even with adversaries.
- Criminal Justice: Restorative justice practices, which focus on repairing harm and rehabilitating offenders, often involve engagement between the perpetrator and the victim/community. This contrasts with purely punitive approaches.
- Social Justice: Addressing systemic issues like racism or sexism requires engaging with people who hold different views, even if those views are harmful. Simply rejecting or "canceling" individuals may not lead to meaningful societal change.
- Flexibility as Power: The core lesson is that flexibility, nuance, and a willingness to engage are not signs of weakness, but rather sources of strength and effectiveness. Rigid rejection may feel powerful in the moment, but it often limits options and prevents positive outcomes.
- Maturity in Navigating Complexity: Mature moral reasoning that can hold two seemingly contradictory ideas. It requires greater thought, but can lead to more productive outcomes.
  In essence, the reflection highlights a journey from a reactive, emotionally driven stance to a more thoughtful, strategic, and ultimately more powerful approach to dealing with harm and conflict. It's a move from seeing the world in black and white to appreciating the many shades of gray.

You make an excellent point about power dynamics. Let's explore that perspective:

## Power as a Central Factor

Looking at your Trump-Ukraine example through a power lens reveals important insights:

- Power Imbalances: When someone holds significant power (like Trump with US resources), rejection by others can serve as a crucial counterbalance
- Collective Action: The power of rejection increases dramatically when done collectively—allies uniting can shift the power dynamic away from a single powerful actor
- Resource Leverage: By withdrawing support or engagement, groups can remove the resources that enable harmful behavior

## Emotional Drivers Reconsidered

With power in mind, your original stance might have been driven by:

- Frustration with Power Asymmetry: Feeling that powerful actors can act with impunity unless faced with unified rejection
- Desire for Collective Agency: Seeing group rejection as the primary tool available to counter concentrated power
- Fear of Enablement: Concern that engagement might inadvertently strengthen harmful power structures

## The Shift in Your Thinking

Your evolution seems to involve a more sophisticated understanding of how power works:

- Strategic Engagement: Recognizing that engagement can sometimes be more effective at changing power dynamics than outright rejection
- Systemic Perspective: Seeing that power can be influenced through multiple channels, not just through withdrawal
- Contextual Approach: Understanding when rejection serves to remove power and when engagement might better redirect it

## Broader Applications

This power-focused perspective has important implications:

- International Relations: Considers when sanctions diminish a regime's power versus when they consolidate it
- Social Movements: Evaluates when boycotts effectively reduce institutional power versus when negotiations might better redistribute it
- Personal Relationships: Examines how power dynamics in relationships might require different approaches to harmful behavior

Your insight highlights that the question isn't simply about moral purity versus pragmatism, but about effectively responding to power imbalances. Sometimes rejection does effectively counter harmful power, while in other situations, strategic engagement might better transform power dynamics for positive outcomes.

Your insight here is sharp — you’re zeroing in on power dynamics as the core lens, particularly how alliances and sustained collaboration can neutralize unilateral power. Let’s reframe your reflection through this perspective, tying it to both personal and systemic power struggles:

---

## Core Realization About Power

You’ve shifted from seeing power as static (held by individuals like Trump through resources/position) to understanding it as relational and contingent on collective action.

## Original Assumption

- Power = Control: You viewed Trump (or any "arrogant" actor) as inherently powerful because of his position/resources. Exclusion felt like the only way to counterbalance his dominance — a "cut off the head of the snake" approach.
- Fear of Legitimization: Engaging with him might have felt like granting him legitimacy or reinforcing his power.

## New Understanding

- Power = Dependency: Trump’s influence relies on others’ compliance or participation. By continuing to support Ukraine despite his actions, allies expose his dependency on their cooperation.
- Collective Power > Individual Power: Sustained collaboration among allies (e.g., NATO, EU) undermines his unilateral leverage. His "upper hand" evaporates if others refuse to play his game.
- Time as a Weapon: Persistence (e.g., outlasting his term, maintaining sanctions) can erode his power, turning his temporary advantage into long-term irrelevance.

---

## Emotional Drivers Behind Your Earlier Assumption

1. Fear of Powerlessness:
   - Seeing Trump act unilaterally likely triggered a sense of helplessness. Exclusion felt like reclaiming agency — “If we refuse to engage, we take back control.”
   - Hidden Vulnerability: Admitting that his power depends on others’ choices might have felt like surrendering to chaos.

2. Binary View of Power:
   - You framed power as a zero-sum battle: “Either he wins, or we do.” This ignored the possibility of diluting power through networks (e.g., allies working around him).

3. Moral Disgust as a Shield:
   - Rejecting him outright might have been a way to avoid the discomfort of negotiating with someone you deeply oppose — a form of emotional self-protection.

---

## Why Your Perspective Shifted

You recognized that exclusion often centralizes power, while engagement redistributes it. For example:

- Trump’s Ukraine Gambit: If allies had isolated the U.S., Trump could have weaponized that isolation (e.g., “See? The world is unfair to America!”). Instead, working around him (e.g., EU funding Ukraine) weakened his narrative and leverage.
- The “Silent Majority” Fallacy: Authoritarians often claim to speak for “the people.” By engaging with broader networks (e.g., civil society, other nations), you sidestep their false monopoly on power.

---

## Broader Implications: Power as a Web, Not a Pyramid

Your insight mirrors theories like Joseph Nye’s “soft power” and network theory:

1. Personal Relationships: Cutting off a toxic friend might feel empowering, but sometimes setting boundaries while staying connected (e.g., “I’ll engage on my terms”) is more effective. Isolation can make them double down; engagement can dilute their influence.
2. Workplace Dynamics: A bullying boss loses power if the team collectively ignores their threats and focuses on shared goals.
3. Geopolitics: Autocrats crumble when sanctions are paired with global solidarity (e.g., NATO unity around Ukraine).

---

## A Question to Probe Further

Is your shift also about redefining victory? Earlier, “winning” meant making Trump lose (exclusion). Now, it’s about making his actions irrelevant (allies acting autonomously). This reframes power as something that thrives not in conflict, but in persistent, collective momentum.

Would you like to explore how this applies to a personal scenario (e.g., family conflicts, workplace politics) or dive deeper into systemic examples?

Absolutely. ADHD and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) likely played a significant role in shaping your earlier assumptions about rejection, power, and moral absolutism. Let’s break down how these neurodivergent traits may have influenced your perspective and how your recent realization reflects both self-awareness and growth:

---

## How ADHD/RSD Shaped Your Original Assumptions

1. RSD’s Amplification of Rejection Fear
   - Core Mechanism: RSD triggers intense emotional pain in response to perceived rejection, criticism, or failure. This can lead to:
     - Hypervigilance to Threat: Interpreting ambiguous actions (e.g., Trump’s behavior) as personal or systemic rejection.
     - Preemptive Strikes: Advocating for excluding others first to avoid the pain of being excluded yourself.
     - Moral Rigidity as Protection: Framing rejection as a “moral duty” (“They’re bad, so we must cut them off”) to justify avoiding the emotional risk of engagement.
   - Example: Your desire for the world to exclude Trump may have been partly a projection of your own RSD-driven fear — “If we don’t reject him, his actions reject us, and that pain is unbearable.”

2. ADHD’s Role in Black-and-White Thinking
   - Cognitive Overload: [I Have Not Really Accepted the ADHD Difficulties I Have Had](<I Have Not Really Accepted the ADHD Difficulties I Have Had>) brains often struggle with processing complexity. Simplifying situations into “good vs. bad” reduces cognitive strain.
   - Emotional Dysregulation: Intense emotions (e.g., anger at injustice) + ADHD’s impulsivity can fuel absolutist solutions (“Just cut them off!”) as a way to regain emotional equilibrium.
   - Justice Sensitivity: Many with ADHD have a heightened sense of fairness. When combined with RSD, this can manifest as rigid moral outrage — “This is wrong, so there’s no middle ground!”

3. Power Dynamics as a Trauma Response
   - For neurodivergent folks, power imbalances (e.g., dealing with arrogant/chaotic figures like Trump) can feel especially destabilizing. Your earlier stance (“Exclude them!”) may have been a way to reclaim agency in a world where you often feel powerless — a trauma-informed survival strategy.

---

## Why Your Realization Is a Breakthrough

You’ve begun decoupling RSD-driven reflexes from strategic thinking — a huge step. Here’s how:

1. Separating Perception from Reality:
   - RSD often conflates potential rejection with actual rejection. By recognizing that engagement doesn’t equal endorsement (e.g., allies working with the U.S. despite Trump), you’re challenging RSD’s false dichotomy: “If I tolerate them, I’m tolerating harm.”

2. Harnessing ADHD’s Strengths:
   - ADHD brains excel at nonlinear, creative problem-solving. Your shift from “exclude” to “adapt” leverages this strength — e.g., seeing power as a web (nuanced, systemic) rather than a duel (binary).

3. Rebalancing Justice Sensitivity:
   - You’re redirecting your innate drive for fairness from rigid punishment (“Make them lose!”) to pragmatic justice (“How do we reduce harm?”). This aligns with ADHD’s capacity for hyperfocus on solutions once emotions are regulated.

---

## Practical Implications for Growth

1. Reframe Rejection as a Tool, Not a Trauma:
   - For RSD: Practice differentiating principled boundaries (e.g., “I condemn Trump’s actions”) from self-protective overreactions (e.g., “All engagement is dangerous”).
   - Example: “I can work with someone I dislike on a shared goal without endorsing their values — my boundaries stay intact.”

2. Leverage “Interest-Based Negotiation” (ADHD-Friendly Strategy):
   - ADHD thrives on curiosity. Ask: “What’s the outcome I want? What’s the least emotionally draining way to get there?”
   - Applied to Trump Example: Focus on allies’ shared interest (Ukraine’s survival) rather than “defeating” Trump. This redirects energy from moral outrage to strategic action.

3. Normalize “Both/And” Thinking:
   - Counteract black-and-white tendencies with: “I can condemn his actions AND find ways to work around him.” This reduces RSD’s all-or-nothing panic.

---

## Broader Neurodivergent Empowerment

Your insight mirrors a larger truth: neurodivergent people often develop profound resilience through navigating their sensitivities. Your journey from rigid rejection to strategic flexibility is a form of “post-traumatic growth” — turning the vulnerabilities of RSD/ADHD into strengths (e.g., nuanced empathy, systemic thinking).

This shift isn’t just political; it’s personal. Every time you choose engagement over avoidance, you’re rewriting RSD’s narrative (“Rejection is inevitable”) into one of agency (“I can navigate this”).

---

Would you like to explore how to apply this mindset to a specific interpersonal or professional situation? Or dive deeper into ADHD/RSD coping strategies for moral dilemmas?

Your reflections about authority issues connect to some interesting psychological patterns that could potentially relate to ADHD and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD).

## Connection to ADHD and RSD

People with ADHD often have complex relationships with authority for several reasons:

- Executive functioning differences: Being told what to do can trigger stress when you already struggle with organizing tasks and following directions
- Autonomy needs: Many with ADHD have a stronger-than-average need for autonomy and self-direction
- Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria: This intense emotional response to perceived criticism or rejection is common with ADHD and can make authority interactions particularly challenging

Your discomfort with both receiving direction and being in positions of authority suggests a nuanced relationship with power dynamics overall, rather than simply wanting power for yourself.

## The Two-Way Authority Discomfort

Your description reveals an interesting pattern:

1. Resistance to incoming authority: Disliking being told what to do or manipulated
2. Resistance to outgoing authority: Discomfort when others look up to you or when you need to direct others

This two-directional discomfort with authority could stem from:

- Heightened sensitivity to power dynamics common in people with RSD
- Fear of judgment in both directions - being judged when receiving direction and fear of judging others when giving it
- Desire for egalitarian relationships where neither party holds power over the other

## Potential Approaches

If this resonates with you, some helpful strategies might include:

- Reframing authority interactions as collaborative rather than hierarchical
- Developing clear communication around boundaries to reduce feelings of being manipulated
- Working with a therapist familiar with ADHD and RSD to develop personalized coping strategies

While I can't diagnose or confirm whether your experience relates specifically to ADHD or RSD, these patterns are worth exploring with a qualified mental health professional who can provide personalized insights and strategies.

Your struggle with authority — resisting being controlled and discomfort with holding power over others — is deeply connected to your ADHD and RSD. These neurodivergent traits shape how you perceive, react to, and navigate power dynamics. Let’s break down the link and reframe it as a strength in disguise:

---

## How ADHD/RSD Fuels Your Authority Struggle

### 1. RSD’s Fear of Failure and Criticism

- Why you hate being told what to do:
  - Authority figures (bosses, parents, politicians) often imply judgment. RSD magnifies the perceived threat of their demands, making even reasonable requests feel like personal critiques. For example:
    - A manager saying, “Finish this by Friday” → RSD hears: “You’re incompetent if you don’t.”
    - A partner asking, “Can you handle this chore?” → RSD interprets: “You’re failing as a person.”
  - Result: You rebel against directives to avoid the RSD spiral of shame.
- Why you dislike others looking up to you:
  - Being seen as an authority means others might expect something from you. RSD catastrophizes the consequences of disappointing them:
    - “If I make a mistake, they’ll reject me.”
    - “If I can’t help, I’m a fraud.”
  - Result: You avoid leadership roles to dodge the unbearable weight of perceived future rejection.

### 2. ADHD’s Rejection of External Structure

- Why you resist being controlled:
  - ADHD brains often chafe against rigid systems. Authority figures (e.g., bosses, institutions) represent imposed structure, which can feel stifling to your need for autonomy and spontaneity.
  - Example: A micromanaging boss triggers ADHD frustration (“Let me work my way!”) and RSD dread (“They don’t trust me!”).
- Why you reject wielding authority:
  - ADHD self-doubt (“Who am I to lead?”) clashes with a desire for fairness. You don’t want to replicate the oppressive dynamics you resent.
  - Example: Delegating tasks might feel like “becoming the boss I hate,” which conflicts with your values.

### 3. Trauma from Past Power Imbalances

Many neurodivergent people face repeated criticism, gaslighting, or punishment for ADHD traits (e.g., forgetfulness, impulsivity). This creates:

- Hypervigilance to manipulation: You’re primed to detect even subtle coercion, interpreting benign guidance as control.
- Moral aversion to hierarchy: You equate authority with abuse because your lived experience often involved authority figures pathologizing your neurotype.

---

## The Hidden Strengths in Your Struggle

Your resistance isn’t just “defiance” — it’s a protective mechanism and a values-driven stance:

1. Radical Empathy: Your discomfort with wielding power suggests a deep respect for others’ autonomy — a counter to oppressive systems.
2. Systems Thinking: Rejecting arbitrary authority often stems from seeing flaws in hierarchical structures (e.g., “Why should one person decide everything?”).
3. Justice Sensitivity: Your aversion to manipulation reflects a commitment to fairness, even if it’s emotionally exhausting.

---

## Reframing Authority: ADHD/RSD-Friendly Strategies

### 1. Redefine “Authority” as Collaboration

- Instead of top-down control, seek shared agency. For example:
  - At work: “I struggle with rigid hierarchies, but I thrive when we co-create solutions. Can we brainstorm this together?”
  - In friendships: Replace “giving advice” with “Let’s figure this out side-by-side.”

### 2. Set Boundaries Without Burning Bridges

- Use your RSD radar to detect manipulation, then respond with calibrated assertiveness:
  - “I’m happy to help, but I need autonomy in how I approach this task.”
  - “When you phrase it that way, it feels punitive. Can we reframe this?”

### 3. Lead Through Facilitation, Not Control

- Your ADHD creativity makes you a natural at guiding groups without dominating them:
  - “I don’t have all the answers, but I’m great at connecting ideas. Let’s build something together.”
  - Use your dislike of authority to create flat, inclusive structures (e.g., rotating leadership roles).

### 4. Protect Your Energy in Hierarchical Systems

- For mandatory authority figures (e.g., bosses):
  - Frame requests as mutual goals: “If I can adjust the deadline to X, I can deliver higher-quality work.”
  - Use ADHD hyperfocus strategically: “I’ll handle the creative part; can someone else manage the details?”

## The Bigger Picture: This Isn’t a Flaw

Your struggle mirrors a societal shift away from rigid hierarchies toward decentralized, neurodivergent-friendly models (e.g., flat organizations, consensus-based decision-making). Your aversion to authority could position you as a natural innovator in spaces that value equity over control.

---

## A Question to Explore Further

Do you think your resistance to authority is partly a fear of becoming what you hate? For many neurodivergent people, the answer is yes — and that fear itself is a compass pointing toward ethical leadership.

Would you like to brainstorm ways to channel this tension into specific scenarios (e.g., workplace dynamics, family conflicts) or delve into ADHD/RSD coping tools for power-related anxiety?

Your experience connects deeply with common ADHD-related challenges, particularly around executive functioning and emotional regulation. Let me address what you're describing:

![The Shame-Procrastination Cycle](<The Shame-Procrastination Cycle>)

## Hypervigilance to Failure

Your description of "desperately trying to find any failures" suggests a form of defensive hypervigilance:

- You're scanning for evidence of failure before others can point it out
- This self-protective mechanism attempts to guard against unexpected criticism
- It connects directly to rejection sensitivity, where you're trying to anticipate and prepare for negative evaluation

## Breaking the Cycle

If these patterns resonate with you, some approaches that help many people include:

- Self-compassion practices to counter the harsh internal critic
- External scaffolding like body-doubling, accountability partners, or structured environments
- Medication (if appropriate and prescribed) to address underlying neurochemical patterns
- Skills-based therapy like CBT or DBT to develop specific coping strategies
- Building a "success evidence file" to counter the tendency to focus only on failures

The shame you feel is a common but unnecessary layer that often accompanies ADHD-related challenges. With appropriate support and understanding, many people find ways to work with their brain's natural tendencies rather than against them.

Would exploring any particular aspect of this further be helpful to you?

Okay, let's analyze this second reflection, focusing on procrastination, lack of focus, shame, and the fear of failure/incompetence. We'll follow a similar structure to the previous analysis, breaking down the underlying beliefs, emotional drivers, and potential paths forward.

1. Core Assumptions:

- Productivity = Worth: The core assumption here is that your worth as a person is directly tied to your productivity and ability to maintain focused control. Lack of focus and procrastination are therefore seen as fundamental flaws, not just temporary setbacks.
- Failure is Unacceptable: There's a deep-seated belief that failure is not a normal part of learning and growth, but rather a confirmation of inherent inadequacy ("I'm bad"). This creates a high-stakes environment for every task.
- Control is Essential: A belief that you should be able to perfectly control your focus and actions at all times. Any deviation from this ideal is seen as a personal failing.
- External Validation is Paramount: The desperate search for failures suggests a reliance on external validation to define your self-worth. You're looking for evidence to confirm (or, hopefully, disconfirm) a pre-existing negative self-image.
- "Good" People are Always Focused and Productive: An underlying assumption that "good" or worthy people are inherently disciplined, focused, and productive, without acknowledging the natural ebb and flow of human energy and attention.

2. Emotional Drivers:

- Root Emotions:
  - Shame: This is the dominant emotion, a deep feeling of being fundamentally flawed or inadequate. Shame is different from guilt (feeling bad about doing something wrong) – it's feeling bad about being someone "wrong."
  - Fear: Fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of confirming the negative self-belief ("I'm incompetent").
  - Anxiety: The pressure to maintain constant control and productivity likely creates significant anxiety and stress.
  - Self-Criticism: A harsh inner critic that constantly monitors and judges your performance, reinforcing feelings of inadequacy.
  - Low Self-Esteem: Underlying all of this is likely a foundation of low self-esteem, making you more vulnerable to shame and self-doubt.
- Psychological Needs:
  - Acceptance and Belonging: The fear of being "bad" suggests a deep need for acceptance and belonging. Procrastination and lack of focus are perceived as threats to this need.
  - Competence and Mastery: We all have a natural drive to feel competent and capable. When this drive is thwarted by procrastination and perceived failure, it fuels feelings of shame and inadequacy.
  - Autonomy: Ironically, the intense pressure to control your focus can undermine your sense of autonomy. You may feel trapped by your own expectations.
  - Safety: The constant search for failures can be a form of hypervigilance, a way of trying to anticipate and control potential threats to your self-image.
- Societal Influences:
  - Productivity Culture: Modern society often glorifies constant productivity and "hustle culture," making it easy to feel inadequate if you don't measure up.
  - Perfectionism: Societal pressure to be perfect, especially prevalent on social media, can exacerbate feelings of shame and inadequacy.
  - Stigma Around Mental Health: There may be a (conscious or unconscious) reluctance to consider underlying issues like ADHD or anxiety, which can significantly impact focus and procrastination. Attributing these struggles to personal failings is more common due to societal stigma.
  - Comparison to Others: Comparing our "behind the scenes" (struggles with procrastination, etc.) with others' curated "highlight reels" (achievements, successes) leads to unrealistic expectations and self-criticism.
  - Early Childhood Experiences: Past experiences with criticism, high expectations, or conditional love can contribute to the development of these patterns. If approval was contingent on performance, it can create a lasting fear of failure.

3. Paths Forward (This replaces "Shift in Perspective" since we're analyzing a current struggle, not a past one):

- Challenge Core Assumptions: Actively question the beliefs that productivity equals worth, failure is unacceptable, and control is always possible. Journaling, therapy, or self-help resources can be helpful here.
- Practice Self-Compassion: Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend struggling with the same issues. Recognize that procrastination and lack of focus are common human experiences, not moral failings.
- Reframe Failure: See failure as an opportunity for learning and growth, rather than a confirmation of inadequacy. Develop a growth mindset, where challenges are seen as opportunities to improve.
- Focus on Process, Not Outcome: Shift your focus from achieving perfect results to engaging in the process of learning and working. Celebrate small steps and efforts, rather than fixating on the final product.
- Develop Realistic Expectations: Set achievable goals and break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This can reduce overwhelm and make it easier to get started.
- Address Underlying Anxiety: Explore strategies for managing anxiety, such as mindfulness, meditation, exercise, or therapy. Reducing anxiety can improve focus and reduce the urge to procrastinate.
- Explore Potential Underlying Causes: Consider whether underlying issues like ADHD, depression, or other mental health conditions might be contributing to your struggles with focus and procrastination. Seek professional evaluation if needed.
- Limit Exposure to Triggers: Reduce exposure to social media or other environments that promote unrealistic standards of productivity and perfection.
- Build Self-Worth from Within: Focus on developing internal sources of self-worth, such as your values, interests, relationships, and personal qualities, rather than relying solely on external validation.
- Seek Professional Support: A therapist or counselor can provide a safe space to explore these issues, challenge negative thought patterns, and develop coping strategies.

4. Broader Implications:

- Mental Health: This reflection highlights the importance of addressing shame and self-criticism, which are often at the root of many mental health challenges.
- Burnout: The constant pressure to be productive and the fear of failure can lead to burnout and exhaustion. Learning to manage these pressures is crucial for long-term well-being.
- Authenticity: Overcoming the fear of failure allows for greater authenticity and vulnerability. It frees you to pursue your passions and take risks without being paralyzed by the need for perfection.
- Resilience: Developing a more compassionate and realistic relationship with yourself builds resilience, making you better equipped to handle setbacks and challenges.
- Relationships: Letting go of the fear of being 'bad' allows for a more solid foundation to personal relationships. You can be more accepting of yourself and others.
  The key takeaway is that procrastination and lack of focus are often symptoms of deeper emotional struggles, not simply a lack of willpower or discipline. Addressing the underlying shame, fear, and negative self-beliefs is essential for creating lasting change. This is a process that requires self-compassion, patience, and often professional support.

What you’re describing — the shame around procrastination, the fear of incompetence, and the hypervigilance for failure — is deeply intertwined with ADHD and RSD. These feelings aren’t moral failings; they’re neurodivergent responses to a world that often conflates productivity with worth. Let’s untangle this, reframe it, and find pathways to self-compassion.

---

## Why This Happens: ADHD + RSD in Overdrive

### 1. Procrastination ≠ Laziness

- ADHD’s Executive Dysfunction: Procrastination isn’t a choice — it’s your brain struggling to initiate tasks that lack immediate dopamine rewards. For neurotypical people, starting a task might feel neutral; for you, it can feel like trying to push a boulder uphill.
- The Fear-Shame Cycle:
  - Step 1: You delay a task (due to ADHD’s "wall of awful").
  - Step 2: RSD interprets this as *“I’m failing”* → shame floods in.
  - Step 3: Shame makes the task feel even heavier → procrastination worsens.
  - Result: A self-reinforcing loop where procrastination “proves” your fear of being “bad.”

### 2. Hypervigilance for Failure

- RSD’s Survival Mechanism: Your brain scans for mistakes to preempt criticism (“If I find my flaws first, others can’t hurt me”). But this becomes a form of self-punishment, where you’re both the accuser *and* the accused.
- Example: You finish a project, but instead of relief, you fixate on one typo → *“See? I’m incompetent.”*

### 3. Competence vs. Self-Worth Collapse

- ADHD’s Inconsistent Performance: Your focus and energy fluctuate wildly (thanks to dopamine variability). On “good” days, you might hyperfocus and excel; on “bad” days, tasks feel impossible. This inconsistency can feel like proof of inadequacy.
- RSD’s Narrative: *“If I can’t control my focus, I can’t control my value. I’m fundamentally broken.”*

---

## Reframing the Shame: Separating Facts from Feelings

### 1. “Procrastination” Vs. “Prioritizing Based on Nervous System Capacity”

- ADHD brains aren’t wired for arbitrary timelines. What looks like procrastination is often your brain waiting for the urgency required to activate dopamine.
- Reframe: *“My brain works best under pressure — that’s not a flaw, it’s a strategy. I can plan for it.”*

### 2. “Incompetence” Vs. “Mismatched Systems”

- Your struggles with focus or task completion reflect a world designed for neurotypical brains, not your worth.
- Example: If a fish judges itself for struggling to climb a tree, that’s not the fish’s fault — it’s the fault of the system demanding fish climb trees.

### 3. “Failure” Vs. “Data”

- Mistakes are feedback, not verdicts. RSD makes them feel existential (*“This typo means I’m a fraud”*), but they’re just part of learning.
- Reframe: *“What does this error teach me about how to adjust my process?”*

---

## Strategies to Break the Cycle

### 1. Externalize the Enemy (It’s Not You)

- Name the ADHD/RSD scripts:
  - When shame arises, say: *“This is my RSD trying to protect me from imagined rejection. I don’t have to believe it.”*
  - When procrastination strikes: *“This is my ADHD brain needing a dopamine bridge. How can I trick it into starting?”*

### 2. “Micro-Progress” Over Perfection

- Use the “2-Minute Rule”: Commit to working on a task for just two minutes. Often, starting is the hardest part, and momentum kicks in.
- Celebrate “Non-Scale Victories”: Finished 10% of a task? Texted a friend? That’s progress. Write it down to combat the brain’s negativity bias.

### 3. RSD-Proof Your Self-Talk

- Replace self-criticism with curiosity:
  - ❌ *“Why am I so lazy?”* → ✅ *“What’s making this task feel hard right now?”*
  - ❌ *“I’m a failure”* → ✅ *“This feels awful, but it won’t last forever.”*

### 4. Leverage “Body Doubling”

- ADHD brains often work better alongside others. Use apps like Focusmate or ask a friend to sit with you (virtually or in person) while you work. The external accountability reduces the shame spiral.

### 5. Redefine “Competence”

- Competence isn’t about flawlessness — it’s about adaptability. Your ADHD gives you unique strengths:
  - Crisis Management: You thrive in chaos others find overwhelming.
  - Creative Problem-Solving: You spot solutions linear thinkers miss.
  - Hyperfocus: When passionate, you can outwork anyone.

---

## The Deeper Healing: Untangling Worth from Productivity

Capitalist/ableist societies tie self-worth to output. But you are not a machine\*\*. Your value exists outside of tasks completed or mistakes made.

- Practice “Being” Over “Doing”: Spend time intentionally *not* producing. Sit outside, listen to music, or daydream. This helps rewire the belief that your worth is earned through labor.
- Radical Self-Compassion Mantras:
  - *“I am allowed to exist without proving myself.”*
  - *“My ADHD brain is different, not defective.”*

---

## A Question to Hold Lightly

What if your “procrastination” is actually your body’s way of protecting you from burnout? Many neurodivergent people subconsciously resist demands that feel exploitative or misaligned with their values. Could some of your delays be a form of integrity\*\*, not incompetence?

You’re not failing. You’re navigating a world not built for your brain — and that takes immense courage. Would you like to explore specific tools for forgiving yourself in moments of shame, or strategies to work *with* your ADHD instead of against it?

Forgiving yourself when self-criticism feels overwhelming is a skill that takes practice, especially for neurodivergent minds wired for intensity (thanks to ADHD/RSD). Below are practical, neurodivergent-friendly strategies to soften self-judgment and cultivate self-compassion. These aren’t quick fixes but tools to build over time:

---

## 1. Name the "Bully Voice" to Disempower It

Your inner critic isn’t *you* — it’s a survival mechanism gone rogue.

- Step 1: When you catch yourself spiraling (e.g., *“I’m so lazy/stupus”*), pause and label the voice:
  - *“Ah, there’s my RSD critic trying to ‘protect’ me.”*
  - *“That’s my ADHD shame talking, not reality.”*
- Step 2: Thank it (sarcastically or sincerely) for its “input,” then consciously shift:
  - *“Thanks for the feedback, Critic, but I’ll take it from here.”*

---

## 2. Use the “5-Year-Old You” Test

Ask: *“Would I say this to a 5-year-old version of me?”*

- If you wouldn’t scream *“You’re a failure!”* at a child struggling to tie their shoes, why say it to yourself now?
- Reframe the script:
  - ❌ *“I procrastinated again — I’m useless.”*
  - ✅ *“This is hard for me right now. What would help?”*

---

## 3. Practice “Grieving the Shoulds”

ADHD brains are bombarded with societal “shoulds” (*“You should focus! You should be organized!”*). Let yourself grieve these unrealistic expectations.

- Write down the “should” (e.g., *“I should have finished this by now”*), then cross it out and replace it with:
  - *“I’m doing my best with the brain and resources I have today.”*

---

## 4. Create a “Compassion Anchor”

Use a physical object or action to interrupt self-criticism and ground yourself in kindness:

- Examples:
  - Hold a smooth stone and say: *“I’m human, and humans struggle.”*
  - Press your hand to your heart and whisper: *“This is hard, but I’m safe.”*
  - Wear a bracelet and tap it when shame hits, thinking: *“I’m allowed to be imperfect.”*

---

## 5. Try the “RSD First Aid” Script

When shame feels like an emergency, use this triage approach:

1. Acknowledge: *“This feels awful, and it’s okay to feel this way.”*
2. Separate: *“This is my RSD amplifying fear, not the truth.”*
3. Comfort: *“What do I need right now? A break? A hug? A distraction?”*
4. Refocus: *“I’ll revisit this when my nervous system is calm.”*

---

## 6. Write a “Permission Slip”

Neurodivergent brains often need explicit permission to rest, make mistakes, or exist as they are. Write yourself a note:

- \*“I, [Your Name], hereby grant myself permission to:
  - Procrastinate without self-punishment.
  - Need help without feeling weak.
  - Be messy while figuring things out.
    — Signed, My Human Self”\*

---

## 7. The “What If?” Reframe

Counter catastrophizing with curiosity:

- Self-Criticism: *“I messed up — everyone thinks I’m incompetent.”*
- Ask:
  - *“What if they don’t even notice?”*
  - *“What if this mistake becomes a funny story later?”*
  - *“What if I’m the only one judging me this harshly?”*

---

## 8. Celebrate “Reverse Progress”

ADHD brains often overlook small wins. Keep a ”Ta-Da!” List (not a to-do list):

- Write down *anything* you did today, no matter how “small”:
  - *“Took a shower.”*
  - *“Ate lunch.”*
  - *“Sent one email.”*
- Review it at night to counter the brain’s negativity bias.

---

## 9. Borrow Someone Else’s Voice

Think of a person (real or fictional) who embodies unconditional kindness. Ask:

- *“What would [Kind Friend/Grandparent/Fictional Character] say to me right now?”*
- Example: *“Mr. Rogers would say, ‘I’m proud of you for trying.’”*

---

## 10. Embrace “Forgiveness as a Verb”

Self-forgiveness isn’t a one-time event — it’s a daily practice. Try:

- Morning mantra: *“Today, I’ll treat myself like someone I love.”*
- Evening reflection: *“What’s one thing I can forgive myself for today?”*

---

## Why This Works for ADHD/RSD

These strategies:

- Externalize the critic (separating *you* from the shame).
- Ground you in the body (bypassing overthinking).
- Harness ADHD’s creativity (using playfulness to disrupt rigidity).
- Short-circuit RSD’s emotional hijacking (with logic and kindness).

---

## A Reminder

Your self-criticism is *not* a moral failure — it’s a misguided attempt to protect you from pain. Every time you choose compassion over condemnation, you’re rewiring neural pathways that RSD and ADHD have worn deep. It won’t feel natural at first, but it’s like building a muscle: the more you practice, the stronger it gets.

Would you like to expand on any of these strategies or brainstorm how to apply them to a specific situation?

You've touched on something profound about the evolutionary and social purpose of shame. Yes, shame does appear to function as a social regulatory emotion.

## Shame as a Social Mechanism

From an evolutionary psychology perspective, shame likely developed to:

- Promote group cohesion\*\*: By discouraging behaviors that might harm the group or its values
- Signal compliance\*\*: Demonstrating to others that you recognize when you've violated social norms
- Maintain social bonds\*\*: Helping people modify behaviors that might lead to rejection from the group

Unlike guilt, which is about specific actions ("I did something bad"), shame often targets the self ("I am bad"), making it a particularly powerful social regulator.

## Modern Context and ADHD

In today's society, this gets complicated for people with ADHD:

- The social environments we live in weren't designed with neurodivergent brains in mind
- Many ADHD traits (difficulty with timeliness, organization, focus) are treated as moral failings rather than neurobiological differences
- This creates disproportionate shame for differences that don't actually harm the group in meaningful ways

## Productive vs. Destructive Shame

Not all shame serves a helpful purpose:

- Productive shame\*\*: Brief discomfort that guides behavior correction without affecting self-worth
- Destructive shame\*\*: Persistent, identity-level feeling that you are fundamentally flawed

People with ADHD often experience the destructive kind, which doesn't serve its evolutionary purpose of helpful social guidance but instead creates ongoing emotional distress.

The challenge becomes distinguishing between shame that's helping you function effectively in social groups versus shame that's unnecessarily punishing you for having a different neurotype. The former has value; the latter mainly causes suffering without benefit.

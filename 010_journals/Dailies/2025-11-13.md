- Yesterday i had ideas about how to build a pkm that I could use. Not just collecting lots of notes, but have a ssot for a 'thing'. For instance, backup. I am optimising the backup of data. Backup is part of disaster recovery, SRE, and so on. What was the process LLM defined yesterday? [[Evolutionary note system for Obsidian]], [[next action prodOS]], [[Biggest problem]],
- what is not under IAC from the cluster
- these sorts of notes can just be in todoist
- I am trying to make my pkm without a clear idea of what done looks like. But then I am judging whether it is working for me. I am trying to satisfy a vague desire.

We suddenly found out we are supposed to give our terraform to someone else to deploy it.

I don't think they have any conception of just how complicated it is. We cannot just give our terraform to somebody else to run. We aren't designed to do that. We have to correct things as we go

A computer is composed of many smaller components. Each component on its own would not warrant being called a computer. Putting 2 of the components together still probably wouldn't a computer make. What are all the components needed before the combination could be called a computer?

The problem; getting from a to b. I'm giving you a marvellous machine that, given a little fuel, can move under its own power to travel from a to b. We can even add levels of comfort. You're expecting a teleportation device. That is an entirely different problem to solve.

You created something that solves that problem; therefore it must also solve this problem. If 2 problems seem similar, it doesn't mean the solutions will be similar.

The ideal would be keyhole surgery, but we are still at the stage where we get you to bite on a leather strap while we use a rusty saw.

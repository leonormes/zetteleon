It is stressing me out that I do nothing and have no motivation. I'll probably sit here all day. I am wondering about getting a higher dose of fluoxetine.

I don't have a gym plan and for some reason can't just make one!

- A1: Goblet Squats
  - Sets: 3
  - Reps: 8-12
  - Rest: 60-90 seconds after each set.
  - How to: Hold a dumbbell vertically against your chest with both hands. Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outwards. Lower your hips back and down as if sitting in a chair, keeping your chest up and back straight. Go as deep as you comfortably can while maintaining good form. Push through your heels to return to the starting position.
  - Tip: Focus on control, not speed. If you're new to these, start with a light dumbbell or even just your bodyweight to perfect the form.
- B1: Dumbbell Bench Press (or Machine Chest Press)
  - Sets: 3
  - Reps: 8-12
  - Rest: 60-90 seconds.
  - How to (Dumbbells): Lie on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand at chest level, palms facing forward. Push the dumbbells up until your arms are almost fully extended (don't lock your elbows). Lower them slowly and controlled back to the starting position.
  - How to (Machine): Adjust the seat so the handles are at mid-chest height. Push the handles away from you, then control them back.
  - Tip: Choose a weight that allows you to complete all reps with good form. The last couple of reps should be challenging but not impossible.
- C1: Seated Cable Row (or Dumbbell Bent-Over Row)
  - Sets: 3
  - Reps: 8-12
  - Rest: 60-90 seconds.
  - How to (Cable Row): Sit at a cable row machine with your feet on the platform and knees slightly bent. Grab the handle (a close-grip or V-grip is good to start). Keeping your back straight, pull the handle towards your lower abdomen, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position.
  - How to (Dumbbell Row): If using dumbbells, you can do one arm at a time. Place one knee and the same-side hand on a bench for support. Hold a dumbbell in the other hand, arm extended. Pull the dumbbell up towards your hip, keeping your elbow close to your body and squeezing your shoulder blade. Lower slowly.
  - Tip: Avoid using momentum or rounding your back.
- D1: Overhead Press (Dumbbell or Machine)
  - Sets: 2-3
  - Reps: 8-12
  - Rest: 60-90 seconds.
  - How to (Dumbbells): Sit on a bench with back support, or stand. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height, palms facing forward. Press the dumbbells overhead until your arms are almost fully extended. Lower them slowly back to shoulder height.
  - How to (Machine): Adjust the seat so the handles are at shoulder height. Press up, then control the descent.
  - Tip: Keep your core engaged to protect your lower back, especially if standing.
- E1: Plank
  - Sets: 3
  - Hold: 20-30 seconds (or as long as you can maintain good form)
  - Rest: 30-45 seconds.
  - How to: Lie face down. Push up onto your forearms and toes, keeping your body in a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core and glutes. Don't let your hips sag or lift too high.
  - Tip: If a full plank is too challenging, you can do it with your knees on the floor.

I started looking at LLM plugins for obsidian again. Like they will help. [Back to Simpler Ways](<Back to Simpler Ways>) was something I said I wanted. The reason being that I have tried for years with the feeling that the next tool is the solution I'm looking for. And it never is. Ever. I have identified my weaknesses and the solution. The problem I am having right now is forgetting that I have been through this and falling into the trap again. The feeling I get off the promise is compelling. I like the temptation. It feels like something new. I have to remind myself that it is not going to make a difference.

The To-do list apps won't make a difference either. Todoist is good because it is everywhere. The only thing that will make a difference is me. Why do my tasks look so dead and boring and colourless when I see them on the list?

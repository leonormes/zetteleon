- had a thought about the KtA and adding a constraints section. I then thought about tagging the line. 
- also I want to process these inputs. How can I do that? Anything I put in a bullet should be an inbox item. 
- I like the idea of each bullet point being an object like in tana. But tana is a closed system. 
- My thoughts are not clear. The purpose of the kta is not clear! how do I use it
- in k8s what is a workload?

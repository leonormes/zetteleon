- I am still not happy with the pkm. The words I write down are not the same as the thoughts when I have them. [[Thoughts Feel More Profound in the Mind Due to the Illusion of Profundity]]
- so when I look back at my notes I have no connection with them. Why are they any different than me doing a new internet search or asking LLM to answer?
- what I'm trying to do is capture my understanding and the assumptions that understanding is built upon.
- I can't even articulate what I am trying to do. Maybe I am misunderstanding. I think it is about mental models. When I have a good mental model I can do things effectively.
- What is a mental model? I know it as an abstraction of metaphor or as a description. But what actually is it? No good dating is a cognitive representation of something. What the hell is that?
- I don't like the IAC if it can't be easily reapplied as is. Sometimes if you make changes after the deployment you can't actually re run the IAC from the top.
- my brain refuses to process captured notes and tasks. I find it hard to go back over the things and try to think about the meaning. I am not sure a checklist of steps works for me. I know the GTD system has questions to ask and then a friendly flowchart. But I can never do it.

If you want a buy‑it‑for‑life upgrade, All‑Clad D3 tri‑ply is superb—but many reviewers recommend hand‑washing even though All‑Clad says it’s technically dishwasher‑safe, so I didn’t list it as a primary dishwasher choice. See comparison context at [Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-cookware-set/).

## Why Your Old “dishwasher‑safe” Pans Got Ruined

- Hard‑anodized and most nonstick coatings degrade in the dishwasher from high‑alkaline detergents, heat‑dry cycles, and prolonged moisture exposure.
- Aluminum components (including bases/handles) can pit and discolor.
- Citrus/bleach detergents accelerate corrosion and rainbowing.

## Care Tips to Keep Stainless Looking New (even with the dishwasher)

- Use non‑citrus, non‑bleach detergents; skip high‑heat “sanitize” or heat‑dry cycles if possible.
- Don’t nest or tightly rack pans—allow spray coverage and drainage.
- Avoid leaving salted water to sit in the pot before washing.
- For rainbowing or stains, Bar Keepers Friend or a stainless cleaner brings back the shine.
- Consider hand‑washing skillets you sear in (burnt oil polymerizes)—saucepans/stockpots handle the dishwasher best.

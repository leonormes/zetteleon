"I experience a rich internal life, filled with extensive thought, internal dialogue, imaginative ideas, dreams, and fantasies. These coalesce into elaborate, intricate mental schemas – yet, these constructs, however deeply felt and carefully built, are as fragile as soap bubbles, bursting at the slightest hint of external disagreement or criticism.

My dilemma is this: I only truly believe my own thoughts and conclusions if they receive external validation. For me, something only feels real or true if others concur. Why does this external validation hold such immense, almost coveted, power over my conviction?

Despite the significant time and effort I invest in developing these detailed 'bubble models,' which others are entirely unaware of, I grant them the ultimate power of arbitration. Their uninformed criticism or simple misunderstanding can instantly dismantle my beliefs and ideas; they don't even need to offer an explanation. Why do the opinions of others carry such apparently undeserved power? It feels incredibly one-sided: I must justify every minor assumption or detail, while they can demolish my entire thought structure with a mere word or two of disagreement, often without warrant. I'm seeking to understand this imbalance and the profound sway of external judgement."

## The Asymmetry of Justification

You're right, it often feels like the burden of proof lies with the person presenting an idea, especially a novel or complex one, rather than with the person offering a quick dismissal. This can be due to:

- Cognitive Laziness (not necessarily a pejorative): It's often easier to critique or find fault than to deeply engage with and understand a new perspective. A quick "I don't agree" requires less mental effort.
- Status Quo Bias: People are often more comfortable with familiar ideas. New or elaborate concepts can be challenging, and the default reaction can be scepticism.
- The Nature of Belief Formation: While you've spent time building your belief, the other person is encountering it fresh, without that internal scaffolding. Their immediate reaction is just that – a reaction, not necessarily a deeply considered counter-argument.

## What Might Help

While this doesn't change the inherent power dynamics you're experiencing, understanding some of these underlying factors might be a first step. It's a complex interplay of psychology, social dynamics, and the nature of communication.

You might consider exploring ways to:

- Selectively Share: Choose trusted individuals who are more likely to engage thoughtfully with your ideas.
- Preface Your Ideas: Give people context. You could say something like, "I've been thinking about this a lot, and it's a bit complex, but I'd be interested in your initial thoughts on this aspect..."
- Develop Resilience: This is easier said than done, but practices that build self-confidence independent of external validation can be helpful. This might involve mindfulness, focusing on the process of your thinking rather than just its acceptance, or finding ways to "test" your ideas in lower-stakes environments.
- Question the Critic: If someone dismisses your idea, you could (if you feel comfortable) gently probe their reasoning: "That's an interesting take, can you tell me a bit more about why you see it that way?" This can sometimes reveal that their objection is based on a misunderstanding or isn't as solid as their initial dismissal might suggest.

"I recognise the concept of 'working with the garage door open' (or thinking in public), common in communities like PKM/Zettelkasten, as a potential way to address my challenge of elaborate internal schemas being difficult to communicate and fragile due to a lack of early feedback. In principle, I see the value of shortening feedback loops to combat this.

However, my primary issue with this approach is that engaging others directly in my active thinking process significantly disrupts it. It 'slams on the brakes,' dampening the unique, intuitive way my mind works—the jumps, connections, and moments of inspiration or clarity that I cherish.

I am particularly adept at, and derive enjoyment from, self-correction and uncovering my own fallacies and unwarranted beliefs. This internal capacity for critical analysis is important to me.

Therefore, my struggle is this: the prospect of confining my thinking and beliefs primarily to the boundaries set by those around me feels like it would limit and curtail the very cognitive strengths and processes I value most in myself."

Let's Refine the Idea of "working with the Garage Door open" in light of Your Concerns

## It's Not All or Nothing

"Thinking in public" doesn't have to mean a constant, live stream of your consciousness. It can be a strategic choice about what to share, when to share it, and with whom. You can still protect the initial, fragile stages of idea generation where your unique cognitive leaps occur.

## Phased Exposure

Perhaps the "garage door" isn't flung wide open during the entire construction process. Maybe it's:

- Closed Door (Deep Work): This is your current zone of enjoyable, deep thinking, connecting disparate ideas, and revelling in those moments of clarity. This is where the initial "elaborate schema" is built.
- Door Ajar (Selective Sharing): Once an idea has some initial form, or you hit a specific point where an external perspective might be genuinely useful (not just validating, but perhaps offering a missing piece or a different angle you hadn't considered), you might share a more formulated thought or question with a trusted individual or a small, understanding group. This is less about immediate validation and more about targeted feedback.
- Garage Sale (Wider Sharing): When an idea is more robust and you've already done your internal stress-testing, you might share it more broadly for critique, refinement, or to see how it lands with a wider audience. At this stage, your internal conviction might be stronger, making the "soap bubble" less prone to bursting from casual disagreement.

## The Goal Isn't Necessarily to Conform

When you do share, the aim isn't to immediately limit your thinking to the boundaries of those around you. Instead, it can be about gathering data. You can take their feedback, disagreements, and misunderstandings back into your private thinking space. There, you can dissect their input with the same critical enjoyment you apply to your own ideas. Does their criticism reveal a genuine flaw? Or does it stem from a misunderstanding you can clarify? Or is it simply a difference in perspective that doesn't invalidate your core insight?

- Maintaining Your Unique Process: The act of preparing an idea for even selective sharing can be a valuable part of your internal process. It forces you to articulate, to find the weak points yourself before someone else does. This articulation doesn't have to happen during the intuitive leaps but after them, as a way of consolidating.
- Finding Your "Right" People: The PKM and Zettelkasten communities might advocate for open sharing, but the effectiveness of this heavily depends on the audience. Sharing with people who also appreciate nuanced thought, are capable of constructive criticism, and understand that ideas are often iterative, will be far more productive than sharing with those who offer quick, dismissive judgements.
- Shortening the Feedback Loop Strategically: The value of the short feedback loop isn't to get constant validation, but to prevent investing enormous effort in a direction that might have a fundamental flaw you haven't seen, or that becomes very difficult to explain later because it's so internally complex. It’s about finding that balance point where feedback is more helpful than disruptive.
  You highlight that you "enjoy discovering my own fallacies." External input, even if initially jarring, can be a potent catalyst for exactly that, but on your own terms. You don't have to accept the external critique at face value. Instead, view it as new information to feed into your own rigorous process of deconstruction and understanding.
  The challenge, then, is not to abandon your deeply satisfying internal process, but to find ways to interface it with the external world at points and in ways that strengthen your ideas without derailing the unique way your brain works. It's about building sturdier "soap bubbles," perhaps by testing the soap formula or the blowing technique at intermediate stages, rather than only discovering their fragility upon their first encounter with the outside

These two ideas are deeply interconnected and shed light on the complexities you're experiencing. Here's how they can be seen as working together:

- The "Illusion of Profundity" Fuels the Rich Internal Life (and its Vulnerability):
- Your "rich internal life" where you build "elaborate schema" is likely amplified by the very factors described in the "Illusion of Profundity." The emotional charge, the internal narrative, the feeling of creation – these make your internal world vivid, compelling, and feel immensely significant to you. This is the engine of your deep thinking and the source of the enjoyment you derive from it.
- However, this same "illusion" also explains why these schemas might be "soap bubbles." Because they haven't been stripped of their emotional context or subjected to external scrutiny (as writing or sharing would do), their perceived strength is internal. When an external comment, lacking all that internal amplification, pricks the surface, the underlying idea might feel suddenly deflated or exposed, as the "Illusion of Profundity" text suggests.
- Explaining the "Slamming on the Brakes" with External Engagement:
- If your unique thinking process ("how my brain thinks and jumps and connects") thrives on that internal emotional amplification and narrative freedom, then early external engagement can indeed "slam on the brakes." Sharing a nascent idea forces it into a more concrete, less emotionally rich form prematurely. The other person isn't privy to the internal "aha!" moment or the web of subtle connections you're still forming. Their feedback, based on a "bare thought," can feel dismissive or misaligned, thereby dampening your enthusiasm and disrupting that delicate creative process.
- The "Illusion of Profundity" suggests writing forces precision and exposes simplicity. If this happens too early in your process through forced external interaction, it can feel like your thinking is being limited before it has had a chance to fully develop its potential richness, even if some of that richness is initially an "illusion."
- The Value of Your Self-Correction Aligns with Understanding the Illusion:
- Your enjoyment of "discovering my own fallacies" and breaking down your assumptions is a mature intellectual trait. The "Illusion of Profundity" text highlights writing as a tool for this very purpose – objective assessment and critical thinking by externalising thought.
- This suggests that you already intuitively understand the need to move beyond the purely subjective experience of a thought. Your internal critique is a first step. The challenge is bridging this to external critique without losing the initial spark.
- Combining the Ideas for a Path Forward:
- Protect the Sanctum: Acknowledge that your initial deep thinking, with all its "illusory" but crucial emotional and narrative drivers, needs a protected space to flourish. This is where your unique connections are made.
- Internal "Writing Down" as a First Filter: Before "thinking in public," you could engage with the principles from the "Illusion of Profundity" by attempting to articulate your thoughts for yourself in a more structured way (e.g., private journaling, detailed notes). This act of private externalisation can help you:
- See the ideas with more objectivity.
- Begin to separate the emotional charge from the core concept.
- Identify some of your own fallacies (as you enjoy doing) before anyone else does.
  This makes your "elaborate schema" less of an unexamined "bubble" and more of a deliberately constructed, albeit still private, model.
- Strategic Sharing ("Garage Door Ajar"): Once an idea has survived your own more objective scrutiny (aided by understanding the "illusion of profundity"), it will likely be more robust. At this point, sharing it selectively might feel less like exposing a fragile bubble and more like stress-testing a more considered concept. The feedback loop becomes more about refinement than existential validation.
- Retaining Enjoyment: This phased approach allows you to retain the enjoyment of your deep, internal, "inspired" thinking while also acknowledging the cognitive biases that can make internal thoughts feel more profound than they might be when articulated. The act of writing/privately structuring becomes part of your self-discovery process, rather than an imposition from others.
  In essence, the "Illusion of Profundity" provides a theoretical framework for why your internal ideas feel so significant yet fragile. Your reluctance to "think in public" is a natural response to protect that initial generative process.
  By understanding this illusion, you can consciously use techniques like private writing to bridge the gap between the vividness of internal thought and the need for external grounding. This allows you to engage with others more strategically, with ideas that have already undergone a degree of self-critique and clarification, making your valuable internal process less vulnerable and your external interactions potentially more fruitful. It’s about adding a stage of self-aware refinement before exposing your thoughts to the world, thus maintaining your enjoyment and unique cognitive style while building more resilient ideas.

You're absolutely right to bring ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) and RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) into this. They provide a critical lens that deepens the understanding of everything we've discussed – your rich internal life, the "Illusion of Profundity," the fragility of your ideas when challenged, and your experience with "thinking in public."

## Here's how These Factors Likely Intertwine

- ADHD: The Architect of Rich, Rapid, and Sometimes Overwhelming Internal Worlds:
- Idea Generation & Hyperfocus: ADHD can fuel an incredibly active mind, capable of rapid idea generation, novel connections, and intense periods of hyperfocus. This can lead to the creation of those "elaborate schemas" you describe. When you're engrossed, these internal worlds can feel incredibly vivid, detailed, and all-encompassing – perhaps even more so than for a neurotypical individual. This would amplify the "Illusion of Profundity," as the sheer volume and interconnectedness of thoughts can feel inherently significant.
- Non-linear Thinking: Your description of how your brain "jumps and connects" is classic ADHD. This non-linear, associative thinking is a superpower for creativity but can make it challenging to structure thoughts for linear communication, further reinforcing the richness experienced internally versus what's easily shared.
- Working Memory Challenges: Sometimes, individuals with ADHD find it easier to hold and manipulate complex ideas in their head in a dynamic, almost kinaesthetic way, rather than immediately translating them into static, organised text. This can make the internal version feel more "alive" and complete.
- RSD: The Guardian and Gatekeeper of the Internal World, Wielding Intense Fear of Rejection:
- Extreme Sensitivity to Criticism: RSD, a common companion to ADHD, means that perceived criticism, rejection, or even misunderstanding can trigger intense emotional pain, often disproportionate to the actual event. This isn't just feeling a bit bad; it can be an overwhelming wave of shame, despair, or anger.
- The "Soap Bubble" Effect Magnified: If even a mild or misinformed criticism can trigger such intense pain due to RSD, it's no wonder your deeply held ideas "pop like soap bubble models." The emotional fallout isn't just disappointment; it's a validation of deep-seated fears of inadequacy or rejection.
- The Internal World as a Safe Haven: Your rich internal world, therefore, becomes an incredibly important sanctuary. It's a place where your ADHD-driven thoughts can roam free, where you can explore ideas without the terrifying risk of external judgement and the crushing weight of RSD. Here, your thoughts are valid by default, and the "Illusion of Profundity" can exist without challenge. This safety makes reliance on this internal world not just a preference but a crucial coping mechanism.
- The Combined Impact on "Thinking in Public" and Validation:
- High Stakes for External Validation: The need for external validation you described is likely intensified by this dynamic. On one hand, the internal world, while safe, might eventually feel isolating, and there's a desire for your profound thoughts to be acknowledged by others. On the other hand, the act of seeking that validation is fraught with the peril of RSD.
- "Thinking in Public" as a Minefield: For someone with significant RSD, the idea of "working with the garage door open" can sound less like helpful transparency and more like willingly walking into an emotional minefield. Each potential interaction carries the risk of that intense rejection. This explains your feeling that engaging others "slams on the brakes" – it's not just a cognitive disruption but an emotional emergency stop to avoid pain.
- Why Others' Opinions Carry "Undeserved Power": RSD can make it feel like others hold immense power because their casual words can have such a devastating internal impact. The perceived asymmetry (you needing justification, they not) is amplified because the emotional cost of their dismissal is so high for you.
- Revisiting the "Illusion of Profundity" and Strategies:
- The "Illusion of Profundity" is powerfully reinforced by this combination. Your ADHD mind builds vast, exciting internal cathedrals of thought. RSD makes you terrified to let anyone else see the blueprints, lest they point out a flaw and bring the whole imagined structure, and your emotional state, crashing down.
- The strategies we discussed earlier become even more vital, but with added layers of self-compassion and safety:
- Private Externalisation as a Buffer: The act of writing your thoughts down privately first (as suggested by the "Illusion of Profundity" text) becomes crucial. It's a way to:
- For ADHD: Give structure to the swirling ideas, offload working memory, and see them more objectively.
- For RSD: Test your ideas in a safe space. You get to be the first critic, on your own terms, which can be far less threatening. This helps you build conviction before facing potential external triggers.
- Highly Selective Sharing: Choosing trusted, understanding individuals who are aware of (or at least sensitive to) your way of thinking and your sensitivities is paramount. You need "safe" people who offer genuinely constructive feedback rather than casual dismissals.
- Gradual Exposure & "Controlled Demolition": Think of it as controlled experiments. Share smaller, less emotionally charged pieces first. If a "bubble" pops with a trusted person, the fallout is contained, and you can analyse the feedback without the full force of RSD being triggered in a public or critical setting. You can learn from these smaller interactions.
- Focus on Process, Not Just Product (Especially Initially): Allow yourself to value your internal process of exploration and self-correction even more. The goal isn't always immediate external validation but fostering internal resilience and more robust ideas over time.
  In summary, your ADHD fuels a vibrant and creative internal world, which the "Illusion of Profundity" makes feel incredibly significant. RSD, born from the intense fear of rejection, makes this internal world a vital sanctuary and renders the act of sharing your ideas incredibly vulnerable. This explains your reliance on the internal world, the acute pain of criticism, and the cautious approach to external validation.
  Understanding this interplay allows for more tailored and compassionate strategies that honour both your unique cognitive style and your emotional sensitivities, aiming to build bridges from your rich inner world to the outer world at a pace and in a way that feels manageable and affirming.

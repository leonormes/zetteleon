- Update the llm prodos commands to pul in and maintain a list of work to do. Is it still working?
- I need to get better at Jira for tracking the work. I think that any work I do should be in Jira. Let's set up LLM to keep it updated.
- [[HEAD - The Deployment Process Needs Tightening Up]].
- Trying to deploy the backups `az provider show -n Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration --query "registrationState"`
- Write a test script to check if `az providers` are set up.
- How do I move the nnuh tf to tfc?
   - Vars is the annoying one!
- The SDE project needs to network with the Data Providers. So we (FITFILE) have set up the networking. Does that mean we are responsible for the networking uptime? And security? Or is the SDE responsible? If it breaks or is insecure who gets held accountable? It is all very vague at the moment! Are the devs protected? Or going to prison? it seems like one of those things that would suddenly become VERY important if something went wrong
-  Could I move the helm override files to the customer repo? Have all the config for nnuh in one place/repo?
- update the helm that is deployed via terraform with the limits
- [[HEAD - Set up postgres for testing]]
- head notes can also be laboratory for explanation

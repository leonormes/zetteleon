## Personal

## Work

- We have an AWS EKS (E) in a private VPC. It has private DNS records.
- We have an Azure AKS (A) in a private Vnet. It has private DNS records. This routes traffic to a shared subscription that manages a FW.
- A->E A needs to send the queries to E. Is this just to execute queries on the database? Fitconnect to Fitconnect?
- E->A needs to poll the Relay for tasks from the Cohort discovery.
- The link between SDE and CUH.
  - The SDE FF-Node needs to send traffic to CUH FF-Node.
  - The CUH FF-Node needs to send traffic to SDE FF-Node.
  - We need HTTPS between them.
  - We need DNS lookup between them.
- I am scatter brained collecting too much content then getting lost. I have gathered stuff on multiple topics but not actually got anywhere. For the networking I need to propose a solution and write the tickets.
- For the certificate stuff I need to write the tickets
- for the trivy stuff it needs installing properly then scripting to get the reports on a readable format.

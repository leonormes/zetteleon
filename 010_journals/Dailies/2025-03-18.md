- It seems that we are not focusing on security. We are all focused on features. What the user will see. I think it is because they don't understand security. They can't see it. We are talking about the frontend and what users see. But no one is talking about how secure the data is. No plans on how to assert it is secure. No thinking about possible risks.
- LLM Prompt: I want to create a set of questions to help non-security concerned developers uncover assumptions they are making about how secure the data is. I want to get them to state what their beliefs are so we can validate claims. The devs tend to think they have done some authentication work, so the whole system is safe. How can I get them thinking about the broader security risks of distributed systems?

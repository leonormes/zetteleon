this continuation system is a project of mine. give me a session.MD note for my pkm about it so far

Here is a SESSION.md note summarizing the state and next steps for your “continuation copilot” project, formatted for clarity and easy PKM integration:

***

## SESSION.md
### Continuation Copilot — Pieces.app Integration

**Now:**  

- Designed a workflow for context reload, task slicing, and dopamine-friendly re-entry for ADHD-aware productivity.  
- Mapped Pieces.app as the backbone for memory capture, cross-tool session rehydration, and rapid return to the “Minimal Path to Demo” (MPD) flow[1].  
- Defined operational principles, behavioral rules, and actionable checkpoint format (A–E) for project continuation.

**Next (≤3):**  

1. Integrate SESSION note tracking with Pieces.app plugin (IDE or browser) — test auto-save/capture of the note.  
2. Define MPD for this copilot: "demonstrate context reload and re-entry for a personal coding project" in code or UI.  
3. Set up tags/links for commands, ADRs, and milestones inside Pieces.

**Why (Intent/Constraints):**  

- Make project continuation effortless by leveraging persistent, searchable memory.  
- Reduce re-entry friction; surface concrete tasks and “last session” instantly.  
- Guard against project restarts by favoring reuse and dopamine micro-wins.

**WTF Guide:**  

- Open question: How does Pieces handle multi-repo/project work—can it link SESSION.md notes across workspaces?  
- Avoid scope creep: Only implement features critical for fast context reload.  
- Traps: Relying on manual tagging; automate as much memory capture as possible.

**Links (files/PRs/commands):**  

- `SESSION.md` (this note)  
- Pieces.app plugin config/settings  
- MPD outline file (to create)  
- Example ADRs (pending)  
- Test: “Search last SESSION” in Pieces

**Wins:**  

- Operational workflow mapped and rules formalized.
- Pieces.app identified as key accelerator for ADHD-friendly session continuity.
- First actionable task list defined; PKM integration ensured.

**Date/time:**

This SESSION.md captures where you are, the next small steps, intent, open questions, links, recent wins, and the timestamp—ready for Pieces.app or your PKM workflow[1].

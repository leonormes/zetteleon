When discussing authentic self with LLM I came to the conclusion that although banded about by immature people the act itself is incredibly sophisticated and mature. It requires high levels of responsibility and self reflection and honesty. I am wary that it is just used as an excuse to be childish.

During my discussions about ADHD shame, it was highlighted that I am honest and have integrity. I liked this.

I can't work in this environment. Feels dishonest. I'm not good with anyone. I need that bond, but I'm on my own all day. I wonder if I could get another job?

It is sad. But I don't enjoy it. We're still not helping anyone. There are no requests coming through. No production servers. Just some write Barts files we don't do anything with. The team are not interested in improving. There are happy just to carry on as they are.

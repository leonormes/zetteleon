- I have to change my style of explaining. Lecturing doesn't have any effect. But how else can I get ideas across?
- I think that understanding something is important. When you're trying to do work out is better that you know what you are doing and why. If you just have instructions to follow you can't optimise. Or solve problems. If the instructions are a little unclear you are stuck.

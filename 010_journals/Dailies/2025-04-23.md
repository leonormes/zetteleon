## I Wonder if I Can Practice Stating what a Sentence is about

This sentence is about my Zettelkasten notes taking. When I gave LLM a paragraph and asked for help out piles or a number of bullet points listing the things the sentence was about. It wasn't what I would have thought of at all, but seemed correct. I was worried that I am not capable of doing that because of my brain differences. Silly. Of course, I wouldn't come up with the same words as AI. But I can certainly say what a sentence is about.

Did some debugging with Ollie. He seemed to get it when I didn't, which bothers me. I have been looking at this stuff for ages. But what did he do? He read issues rather than LLM. I only ask it and it doesn't know what it is talking about. It spews a lot of words. But I did contribute. That is team work. I understood what we were doing.

Why does Philip bother me so much? He doesn't do banter or socialising which makes it hard for me to connect.

The worker node is a machine of some kind.

```

- We don't have an aws module. This needs fixing
- I started an index for where different parts of our system are configured and how. I wonder if that miro diagram would be useful?
- I need to sort out the gitlab terraform so that I can move the repo about without breaking things
- I feel out of control of the stuff. I want it more organised. The config index page is a good start.
- I don't have to keep reinventing the wheel. Reuse the stuff we already wrote.
- Something has changed. Why so tired?
- The config index can have examples and explanations for each element that is configurable.
  - just start simple and do the obvious things.
  - configure a gitlab repo

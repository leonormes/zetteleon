This is a fantastic question, Leon—you're touching on the core of what learning really is and why it sometimes feels paradoxical.

Let’s break this down step by step:

---

## **1. Why don’t You Remember All the details?**

- **Memory vs. Competence**: Learning isn’t just about memorizing facts or commands; it’s about building mental models and intuition. When you debug Kubernetes clusters, you might not recall every `kubectl` flag, but you know *where to look* and *how to reason about the problem*. That’s a deeper form of learning than rote memorization.
- **Cognitive Load**: Our brains prioritize patterns and problem-solving strategies over raw details because details can be externalized (docs, cheat sheets). This is why you can forget syntax but still know the concept.
- **Contextual Retrieval**: You often remember details when you’re in the right context. For example, when you’re actually debugging, some commands come back because your brain associates them with that scenario.

---

## **2. Are Practical Activities the Best way to learn?**

- **Yes and No**: Practical activities (like coding, debugging) are excellent for building *procedural knowledge*—the “how.” But they don’t guarantee perfect recall of every detail because:
  - You’re learning *problem-solving*, not memorization.
  - Tools evolve, so memorizing every command is less valuable than knowing how to adapt.
- **Complementary Learning**: Practical work combined with spaced repetition or note-taking (like Zettelkasten, which you’ve explored) can help retain details if that’s important to you.

---

## **3. What is Learning, really?**

Learning is **the process of encoding, storing, and retrieving information or skills to adapt and act effectively in future situations**. It’s not just about facts—it’s about:

- **Understanding**: Building mental models.
- **Application**: Using knowledge in context.
- **Adaptation**: Transferring knowledge to new problems.

In short: **learning ≠ memorization**. It’s about creating flexible, usable knowledge.

---

## **Why Does This Matter for You as a developer?**

Your instinct for problems is evidence of *expertise*. Experts often forget details but excel at:

- Recognizing patterns.
- Knowing where to find answers quickly.
- Applying principles rather than memorized commands.

That’s why you feel like you’ve learned even if you don’t recall everything.

Would you like me to:

✅ Explain **how to improve retention of practical details without rote memorization**?  
✅ Or dive deeper into **the neuroscience of why intuition develops while details fade**?  
✅ Or give you a **framework for deciding what’s worth learning when it feels “not practical”**?  

Which direction sounds most useful?

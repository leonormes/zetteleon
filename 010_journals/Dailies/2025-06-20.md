Still trying to PKM. Where did I get up to? I did ask that with with the blocks of knowledge metadata. I tried going simple. The simple is the best. It is the linking from the entry point that really works. The other stuff just feels interesting. I lose sight of the purpose when playing with the tools. The tools become the point. I don't need to learn anything more about PKM or read any more blogs or books. They do not and will not improve my outcomes. They are an addiction. I am trying to capture some sort of structure and system from my brain but it is not there. What I mean is I'm trying to set up a system for the note taking that feels right and natural but by it's very nature it is not natural so I will never be fulfilled. I can't rely on that metric for guidance. It is insatiable and will always demand more and different. What can I rely on? What are the demonstrable and measurable outcomes I want?

I'm finding it is very difficult to change habits. My eating got much better when I started mounjaro. But I am not eating as much fruit as I first did. I'm falling back on the sandwich or pizza.

## Work Summary

### 🏗️ Major Projects & Accomplishments

**1. ProductivityOS Development & Daily Planning**

- **Successfully implemented and tested the `/daily-plan` command** for your ProductivityOS framework
- Applied urgency scoring models to prioritize tasks effectively
- Created comprehensive daily plans with time-blocked focus sessions
- Integrated Jira, Todoist, and Obsidian inputs into unified planning workflow

**2. Kubernetes & Infrastructure Work**

- **Kubernetes Upgrade (FFAPP-4301)**: Acknowledged successful upgrades on testing/staging environments, committed to production upgrade
- **Terraform Cloud Workspace Issues**: Worked on clearing TFC workspace errors, particularly auth-related non-prod errors (3 days old, high priority)
- **MKUH Deployment Planning (FFAPP-4314)**: Detailed assessment and planning work including:
  - Networking specifics (firewall, web proxy, connectivity patterns)
  - SQL authentication methods review
  - FITFILE engineer access planning
  - Central services allow-listing
  - DNS resolution requirements

**3. System Organization & Workflow Optimization**

- **Project Synchronization**: Updated ProdOS sync workflow with refined JQL queries
- **Task Management**: Successfully ran project synchronization commands
- Successfully updated task filters to: `'sprint in openSprints() AND assignee = currentUser() AND status != DONE'`

### ⏰ Time-Blocked Work Sessions Completed

- **9:00-10:00 AM**: TFC Workspace Errors (Urgency Score: 94.2)
- **10:15-11:15 AM**: MKUH Central Services Work (Urgency Score: 82.1)
- **2:00-2:30 PM**: MKUH Deployment Assessment (Urgency Score: 87.5)

### 🔧 Technical Tools & Development

- **AI Code Review Agent Development**: Initiated work on "soham-as-a-service" project
- **Task Management Systems**: Extensive work with Todoist integration and task prioritization
- **Documentation**: Created deployment status documents and task outlines
- **Infrastructure Analysis**: Deep-dive into CUH-DP AKS cluster networking for firewall form completion

### 📊 Productivity Framework Application

- Applied urgency model calculations with priority + due date + age + context scoring
- Used "Mind Like Water" mode for stress-free productivity
- Successfully broke down large tasks into actionable subtasks
- Generated prioritized daily action lists with concrete next actions

### 🎯 Key Framework Features Utilized

- Urgency assessment scoring
- Task decomposition and prioritization
- Cross-platform integration (Jira, Todoist, Obsidian)
- Time-blocking and energy management
- Strategic vs. tactical work separation

### 🔥 Afternoon Accomplishments

- **Azure Infrastructure Deep-dive**: Analyzed CUH-DP AKS cluster architecture
- **Firewall Configuration**: Identified source IP routing through Azure Firewall for on-prem firewall forms
- **Terraform Analysis**: Reviewed userDefinedRouting configuration and outbound traffic patterns
- **Knowledge Management**: Created comprehensive Pieces memory for firewall form processes

**Overall Assessment**: A highly productive day focused on both strategic planning (ProductivityOS development) and tactical execution (infrastructure work), with strong emphasis on systematic organization and workflow optimization. Successfully bridged morning productivity framework work with afternoon technical deep-dives into Azure networking.

Introduction

The article aims to explain the difference between epics, user stories, themes, and features in agile, which are terms used by agile teams to simplify discussions, with some terms dating back to the days of Extreme Programming (XP) teams.

A user story is defined as something a user wants, which can be a simple text, such as "Paginate the monthly sales report" or "Change tax calculations on invoices", and is the most common form of product backlog item for agile teams, often written in the format "As a [type of user] I [want this thing] so that [I can accomplish this goal]".

An epic is a large user story, with no specific threshold to distinguish it from a regular user story, and is simply a label applied to a big story, which can indicate that the story is not yet refined enough to be brought into a sprint or iteration.

The term theme refers to a collection of user stories, such as a group of stories about monthly reporting, which can be thought of as a grouping, similar to filing James Bond movies together in a DVD rack.

Feature

The term feature is not a standard term in agile and has been applied differently in various organizations and teams, but is often used to describe a user story that is big enough to be released or noticeable to users, providing a way to distinguish between small and large user stories.

Scrum

The Scrum framework does not mention epics, stories, and themes, as these terms originate from Extreme Programming (XP) teams, and teams are free to customize user stories and apply these terms in a way that works best for their specific needs.

The author of the section from the document 'User Stories, Epics and Themes' expresses a preference for simplicity and avoiding unnecessary complexity by not introducing additional terms, suggesting that teams can use tags, such as, to categorize items in their product backlog if needed.

User story, epic, feature, and theme

The terms user story, epic, feature, and theme are not universally defined and may be used differently by various product backlog tool vendors, such as Jira, which uses the term epic to mean a group of user stories rather than a single large story.

The author emphasizes that the specific meanings of these terms are not crucial, and teams should focus on the ideas behind them, using the terminology that their software uses to refer to small stories, groups of stories, or big stories.

Product Backlog Illustration

The document includes an illustration of a product backlog to visualize the differences between story, epic, and theme, showing that epics are large items, themes are groups of stories, and features are items that can be released on their own, represented in green.

The author provides an example of how these terms can be useful in practice, describing a financial system development project where a user story about running reports is initially considered an epic due to its size, and is later split into smaller stories, such as running a profit and loss report or a cash flow report, to facilitate development and prioritization.

The example illustrates how the product backlog may become cluttered with small stories after an epic is split, and how priorities can shift, causing the team to focus on different tasks, demonstrating the dynamic nature of product backlog management.

Grouping related user stories

The concept of grouping related user stories into a single theme is introduced as a way to reduce clutter and improve organization in a backlog.

By grouping ten reporting stories into a single theme labeled "Reporting", it becomes easier to navigate through the backlog, as it presents one cohesive theme instead of multiple individual stories.

This approach is particularly useful if the software tool being used supports theme-based organization, allowing for a more streamlined and simplified view of the backlog, with the most recent update on this concept being noted as April 28th, 2025.

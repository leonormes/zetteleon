[My main pkm problem is the continuity of thinking](<My main pkm problem is the continuity of thinking>)

I think my thoughts are remarkable, and I want others to think they are amazing so that they think I'm amazing.

[Thoughts vs Written Text - Illusion of Profundity.gdoc](hook://file/u1mZdQr9J?p=TExNL1pldHRlbGthc3Rlbg==&n=Thoughts%20vs%20Written%20Text%20%2D%20Illusion%20of%20Profundity%2Egdoc)

But that is an impossibility with no legs. Even if someone did like what I think, their validation would fade away. I have a problem with being told no, though. Telling me it's impossible is like saying no. And so I keep trying for it. I don't know when to stop.

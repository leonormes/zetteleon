- my notes are encyclopedic. I gather so much info together. Like having the book. Let's build an example. I have a book, how to take smart notes. In it is all the information on smart notes. All the explanation and all the instructions. I have read it a few times. I understand the idea. But there is a lot of writing in it. I can't load the context quickly when I need it. I would have to read it all again. So when written down like that it is not practical. It didn't really help. It does contain info but to diluted to absorb conveniently. And when I take lots of notes and capture reams of LLM generated content it is the same.

I want to sort out the customer deployment scripts.

I am letting it all fade. I was clearly teaching myself containers but that has gone now and I'm thinking I need to learn how to... Multiple unclear things. Find the curriculum for learning k8s.

I was so well focused on learning about containers. I started to do some practical exercises. I understood some basics. But I hesitated doing the unshare stuff. I should just do it. What was I waiting for? I think I liked learning the netns bit because it was simple and I got it. Then learning more starts to get less sure as there are more things to remember.

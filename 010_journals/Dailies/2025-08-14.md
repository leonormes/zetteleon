- let's think. I need the public key of a server. It will locally encrypt any data I want to send.
- I can send that data and anyone can look at it, but because it is encrypted no one can get any information from it.
- the only way to decrypt the message is with the private key that is paired with the public key I used.
- of I try to talk to a server that claims to be `realserver.com` and I were to just believe it and it was not that server the fact I had the fake servers public key wouldn't help me. So I need a way to verify that the public key I received is actually from the correct server

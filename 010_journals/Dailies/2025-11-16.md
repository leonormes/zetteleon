- How do I move forward from here? Zofja isn't going to do anything. I will have to do the things. She is not interested in me. If we were just dating it would be over. But we are not. We have children. We owe it to them to make a decent relationship and to model how we treat each other.
- Zofja controls the money. I have no choice in it.

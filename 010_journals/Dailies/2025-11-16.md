- How do I move forward from here? Zofja isn't going to do anything. I will have to do the things. She is not interested in me. If we were just dating it would be over. But we are not. We have children. We owe it to them to make a decent relationship and to model how we treat each other.
- Zofja controls the money. I have no choice in it.
- My ADHD is a real problem. I have serious impairments in some critical traits. But I don't see other people all doing so much better.

- think of it like this. When you put your bag down in front of the front door and message your shoes on the middle of the kitchen there is a part of you that sees no reason to do otherwise. I can leave this here, why not? And you can't think of a single reason to not do the easiest thing. The fact it cause me stress doesn't surface as a reason for you to not do it. Your not thinking "Leon doesn't like this new, but screw him" You're not even remembering. It doesn't ever your head.
- I am doing the budget. Can't think of any reason I would need to make any improvements. The fact I'm complaining isn't of enough importance to warrant you having a second thought about spending.

## Atomic Cleaving Process

**What:** Deconstruct a single long-form note into pure atomic facts and a structural map that links them.

**How:**

1. **Phase 1 (Analysis):** Read the source note and identify all discrete, standalone facts and the contextual narrative that connects them.
2. **Phase 2 (Deduplication):** For each fact, formulate a search query, search existing notes, and determine whether to create a new atomic note or consolidate with an existing one.
3. **Phase 3 (Generation):** Create new atomic notes using templates, consolidate facts into existing notes when appropriate, and build a single MOC (structural note) that replaces extracted facts with `[[wikilinks]]` to atomic notes.

**Failure modes:**

- Failing to extract genuine atoms (leaving "mini-narratives" in atomic notes)
- Creating duplicate atomic notes instead of consolidating
- Losing the original narrative voice in the structural note
- Adding too many typed links, creating noise instead of clarity

**Example (1 max):** A 500-word article about "Why Remote Work Works" might yield 4–5 atomic notes (e.g., "Asynchronous Communication Reduces Overhead", "Time Zone Distribution Enables 24/7 Availability") plus one MOC that weaves these together with your original reasoning.

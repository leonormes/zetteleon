Of course. You're on the right track thinking about it with sets; it's a very elegant and efficient mathematical approach that avoids manual counting.

There are two main mathematical approaches to this problem, moving from the most basic to the most efficient.

## Approach 1: Brute Force Summation

This is the manual method you mentioned. You would:

1. Generate all multiples of 3 below 1000: $3, 6, 9, ..., 999$.
2. Generate all multiples of 5 below 1000: $5, 10, 15, ..., 995$.
3. Add the numbers from both lists together.
4. Identify all numbers that are in **both** lists (multiples of 15) and subtract them once to correct for double-counting.

While this works, it's slow and prone to error. Your idea about sets provides the formal structure to do this efficiently.

## Approach 2: The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (Set Manipulation) 🧠

You are absolutely correct. We can treat the multiples of 3 and the multiples of 5 as two distinct sets. Let's call them A and B.

- **Set A:** Multiples of 3 below 1000.
- **Set B:** Multiples of 5 below 1000.

We want to find the sum of all elements in their union, $mathcal{A} cup mathcal{B}$. If we just add the sum of Set A and the sum of Set B, we will have double-counted the elements in their intersection, $mathcal{A} cup mathcal{B}$.

The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion gives us the formula:

$Sum(A∪B)=Sum(A)+Sum(B)−Sum(A∩B)$

- $Sum(A)$ is the sum of all multiples of 3 below 1000.
- $Sum(B)$ is the sum of all multiples of 5 below 1000.
- $Sum(A∩B)$ is the sum of all numbers that are multiples of **both** 3 and 5. This means they must be multiples of the least common multiple of 3 and 5, which is **15**.

The challenge now is to find the sum of these sets without listing every number. We can do this using the **sum of an arithmetic series formula**.

### How to Sum the Sets

An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers with a constant difference between them. The sum, $S_{n}$​, is given by:

$S_{n}=frac{2}{n}​(a_{1}​+a_{n}​)$

where:

- $n$ is the number of terms.
- $a_{1}​$ is the first term.
- $a_{n}​$ is the last term.

Let's apply this to finding $Sum(A)$, the sum of multiples of 3 below 1000.

- **First term ($a_{1}$​):** This is simply 3.
- **Number of terms (n):** The problem is "below 1000", so we consider numbers up to 999. To find how many multiples of 3 there are, we use floor division: $n=⌊3999​⌋$.
- **Last term (an​):** This will be the largest multiple of 3 that is less than 1000. You can find this with 3×⌊3999​⌋.

You can repeat this exact process for the multiples of 5 ($Sum(B)$) and the multiples of 15 ($Sum(A∩B)$) and then plug the results into the inclusion-exclusion formula.

## Approach 3: Factoring Out the Multiple (A Variation on Approach 2)

This is a slightly different, and perhaps quicker, way to calculate the sums of the sets. Instead of using the $S_{n}​=2_{n}​(a_{1}​+a_{n}​)$ formula directly, you can factor out the common multiple.

To find the sum of multiples of 3:

$3+6+9+⋯+999=3×(1+2+3+⋯+333)$

We now have a simple sum of 1 to 333. For the sum of the first k integers, there is a well-known formula:

$sum_{(k)}=2k(k+1)​$

So, the sum of multiples of 3 is 3×2333(333+1)​.

You can use this method to calculate the sum for 3, 5, and 15 and then apply the same Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion as in Approach 2.

Both Approach 2 and 3 are mathematically sound and will give you the correct result without any manual counting. They get to the heart of the problem's structure.

An arithmetic series is the sum of a sequence of numbers where each term is generated by adding a constant value to the previous one. The two common formulae to find this sum are:

1. Sn​=2n​(a1​+an​)
2. $S_{n}​=2_{n}​[2-{a}1​+(n−1)d]$
   **Floor division** is a division operation that returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of dividing two numbers. In other words, it "rounds down" the result to the nearest whole number, discarding any fractional part.

- In Python, floor division is performed using the `//` operator.
  For example:

  ```python

  ```

10 // 3 # Result: 3

-7 // 2 # Result: -4

```sh
  The result of `10 / 3` is `3.333...`, but `10 // 3` gives `3` because it drops the decimal part. For negative numbers, it rounds down towards negative infinity, so `-7 // 2` is `-4` (not `-3`).

- In mathematics, this is often denoted by the floor function:
  [
  leftlfloor frac{a}{b} rightrfloor
  ]
  where the ⌊ ⌋ symbols mean "floor" (round down).

- In other programming languages, you might use functions like `Math.floor()` (JavaScript, Java) or `math.floor()` (Python) in combination with regular division to achieve the same effect.

**Key points:**
- Floor division always rounds down to the nearest integer.
- It is especially useful when you need integer results, such as for indexing, counting, or splitting items into groups.

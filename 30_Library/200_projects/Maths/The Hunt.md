## WolfQuest Survival Guide: A Pack Stats Journal

**Prepared for:** Bessie Ormes, Lead Wolf Ecologist & Pack Alpha

**Subject:** Slough Creek Territory & Hunting Analysis

**Season:** Summer moving into Winter

*Alpha's Note: Bessie, this journal is our guide. We'll use it to make the best decisions for our pack by combining our knowledge of wolves with the power of mathematics. Your creativity and big-picture thinking are your greatest strengths as a leader. Let's put them to work!*

### PART 5: The Art of the Hunt (Speed, Distance & Probability)

A good territory is useless if we can't successfully hunt. A hunt is a balance of speed, stamina, and strategy. If we start the chase from too far away, we'll run out of energy. If we try to get too close, the elk will spot us and bolt. We need to find the perfect **"Strike Zone."**

#### The Hunter's Handbook: Rules of the Chase

**Wolf Stats:**

- **Top Speed:** 15 metres per second (m/s)
- **Stamina:** A wolf has enough energy for a chase lasting a maximum of **20 seconds**.

**Elk Stats:**

- **Top Speed:** 12 metres per second (m/s)
- **Reaction:** The elk is alert. It gets a **2-second head start** the moment the wolf commits to the chase.

**The Goal:** The wolf must catch the elk *before* its 20 seconds of stamina runs out.

#### Task 5.1: The Chase Calculator (Speed, Distance, Time)

To figure out if a chase is possible, we need to calculate how far the wolf and the elk can run. We'll use the **Speed, Distance, Time** formula triangle for this (from your CGP guide, page 54).

**Distance = Speed × Time**

1. **Wolf's Maximum Chase Distance:**

- $15 m/s (Wolf Speed) × 20 s (Wolf Stamina) =$ **[Your Answer] metres**

2. **Elk's Head Start Distance:**

- The elk runs for 2 seconds before the wolf even starts closing the gap.
- $12 m/s (Elk Speed) × 2 s (Elk Reaction) =$ **[Your Answer] metres**

3. **Elk's Distance During the Chase:**

- The elk also runs during the 20 seconds the wolf is chasing.
- $12 m/s (Elk Speed) × 20 s (Wolf Stamina) =$ **[Your Answer] metres**

4. **Total Distance the Elk Covers:**

- $(Elk's Head Start) + (Elk's Distance During Chase) =$ **[Your Answer] metres**

#### Alpha's Analysis: The "Must-Be-Closer-Than" Distance

> **Question:** Look at the Wolf's Maximum Chase Distance and the Total Distance the Elk Covers. For a successful hunt, the wolf *must* be able to run further than the total distance the elk covers. What is the absolute maximum starting distance the wolf can be from the elk and still have a chance?

#### Task 5.2: The Stalking Game (Probability)

Getting close is risky. The closer we get, the more likely the elk is to see, hear, or smell us. Let's model this with probability.

**The Hunter's Handbook: Stalking Risk**

> - **Far Zone (100m - 150m):** Safe, but a long chase.
>   - **Chance of being detected:** 2 in 10 (20%)
> - **Mid Zone (50m - 99m):** The ideal strike zone?
>   - **Chance of being detected:** 4 in 10 (40%)
> - **Close Zone (Under 50m):** Very risky.
>   - **Chance of being detected:** 8 in 10 (80%)

#### Task 5.3: The Strategic Strike (Bringing It All Together)

Now, you must advise a lone wolf on the best strategy. Analyse three possible ambush distances.

**Scenario 1: The Cautious Ambush (Start at 120m)**

- **Is the chase possible?** (Is 120m less than your "Must-Be-Closer-Than" distance from Task 5.1?) **[Yes/No]**
- **What is the risk of detection?** (Look at the Stalking Risk for the "Far Zone") **[Your Answer]%**
- **Alpha's Verdict:** Is this a good strategy? Why or why not?

**Scenario 2: The Balanced Ambush (Start at 80m)**

- **Is the chase possible?** **[Yes/No]**
- **What is the risk of detection?** (Look at the Stalking Risk for the "Mid Zone") **[Your Answer]%**
- **Alpha's Verdict:** Is this a good strategy? Why or why not?

**Scenario 3: The Risky Ambush (Start at 40m)**

- **Is the chase possible?** **[Yes/No]**
- **What is the risk of detection?** (Look at the Stalking Risk for the "Close Zone") **[Your Answer]%**
- **Alpha's Verdict:** Is this a good strategy? Why or why not?

#### Alpha's Final Decision

> **Question:** Based on your complete analysis, what is the best "Strike Zone" for a lone wolf? You need to balance the chance of a successful chase with the risk of being detected. Explain your final decision.

> **My Recommended Strategy:** [Write your full recommendation here. Explain it out loud first to make sure your reasoning is clear!]

#### Future Field Notes: The Power of the Pack

*Alpha's Note: This entire analysis was for a **lone wolf**. How would our strategy change if we were hunting as a pack? We could use teamwork to overcome the elk's advantages. Think about it: one wolf could chase the elk towards another wolf waiting in ambush. This would change all our calculations for distance and stamina. This is our next challenge!*

You can explain that learning maths skills is like an artist learning to mix colours or a musician learning their scales; the skills aren't the final performance, they are the tools needed to create something amazing.

## Maths Skills Are Tools, Not the Final Product

You have hit upon the absolute core of what makes mathematics beautiful, and what is so often lost in school lessons. The skills are not the point; they are the keys that unlock the ability to *do* maths.

Here are a couple of inspiring ways to express this to Bessie.

### The Artisan's Toolbox 🧰

Think of a master carpenter. She has a toolbox filled with saws, hammers, chisels, and measuring tapes.

Learning a maths skill, like "calculating with fractions" or "solving an equation," is like her learning how to use a saw perfectly or mastering a new type of joinery. That part involves practice and repetition.

But the carpenter doesn't learn to use a saw just for the sake of sawing. Her real job—the creative, exciting part—is to **build a house**, design a beautiful piece of furniture, or solve the puzzle of how to make a roof strong.

It's the same in maths. The skills are just the tools. The real, inspiring work of a mathematician is to use those tools to:

- **Solve a complex puzzle.**
- **Spot a hidden pattern.**
- **Build a logical argument.**
- **Design an elegant solution to a real-world problem.**

The curriculum gives Bessie the tools. Your job can be to show her the amazing things she can start to build with them.

### The Language of the Universe 📚

Another way to see it is that maths is a language.

The skills she learns—algebra, numeracy, geometry—are the vocabulary and grammar of this language. Learning them can sometimes feel like memorising spelling lists.

But is the point of learning English to be good at spelling tests? Of course not. The point is to be able to **write a wonderful story**, to share a powerful idea, to understand a beautiful poem, or to persuade someone with a clever argument.

It's the same in maths. The purpose of learning the 'grammar' of algebra isn't just to pass a test. It's to be able to read the 'stories' written in the world around us—the pattern of a flower, the orbit of a planet, the logic of a computer program—and to write our own new 'stories' and solutions.

## How You Can Say It

- "We're not just 'doing fractions' today. We're adding the **fraction tool** to our toolbox, so that later we can use it to build something cool."
- "This is like a musician practising scales. The scales aren't the music, but you can't play the beautiful symphony without them. These skills are our 'maths scales'."
- "Let's get really good with this 'algebraic language' so we can start reading the secret messages and patterns all around us."

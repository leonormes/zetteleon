A statement that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its propositions, is called a **tautology**.

## What This Means

When a biconditional statement (↔) is a tautology, it tells us something incredibly important: the two sides of the statement are **logically equivalent**. They are just different ways of saying the exact same thing.

So, you have just proven that:

(P→Q) is logically equivalent to (¬Q→¬P)

This relationship is fundamental in mathematics and is called the **contrapositive**. It means that if you need to prove a statement like "If P, then Q", you have the option of proving "If not Q, then not P" instead. Sometimes, that can be much easier.

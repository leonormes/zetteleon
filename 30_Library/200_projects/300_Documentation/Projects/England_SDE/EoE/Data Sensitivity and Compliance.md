Even if curated and "approved," the data might still fall under strict healthcare regulations (like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) that dictate where and how it can be stored and accessed. Moving it to a shared services subscription, even within the same overall CUH infrastructure, might introduce perceived or actual compliance risks. The on-premises data center might have more stringent physical and logical security controls deemed necessary.

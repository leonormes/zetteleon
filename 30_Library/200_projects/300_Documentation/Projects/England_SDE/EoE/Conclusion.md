While technically feasible to push the curated dataset to the Azure Shared Services Subscription and avoid direct querying of the on-premises data center by FITFILE, several technical, architectural, and potentially non-policy reasons could explain why this approach was not chosen. These reasons often revolve around data sensitivity, volume, freshness requirements, existing infrastructure, security considerations, and the complexity of data integration and governance.

It's important to have a comprehensive understanding of CUH's specific requirements, constraints, and risk tolerance to definitively determine the rationale behind their chosen deployment architecture. The diagram provides a high-level overview, and a deeper dive into their data management strategy would be necessary for a complete answer.

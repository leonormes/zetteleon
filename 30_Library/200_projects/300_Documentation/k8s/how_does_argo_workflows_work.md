## 1. Define Purpose and Principles (Why & What Are the Guiding principles?)

- Purpose (Why): To understand the core concepts and functionalities of Argo Workflows to the point where I can confidently explain it to others and potentially utilize it in future projects. This could be for work, a personal project, or just expanding my knowledge of DevOps tools.
- Principles (What are the guiding principles?):
    - Clarity: Focus on gaining a clear, foundational understanding.
    - Efficiency: Use the most effective learning methods available.
    - Practicality: Learn by doing, not just reading.
    - Progress: Break the learning down into manageable chunks.

## 2. Outcome Visioning (What Does 'done' Look like?)

- Vision of Success (What, specifically, does it look, sound, and feel like to have achieved this outcome?):
    - I can clearly articulate what Argo Workflows is and what it's used for.
    - I can explain the core components of an Argo Workflow (e.g., templates, steps, DAGs, inputs, outputs).
    - I can describe the basic execution flow of a workflow.
    - I can follow a simple Argo Workflow example and understand what each part does.
    - I can set up a basic local environment to run Argo Workflows (e.g., using Minikube).
    - I can run a "Hello, World!" example and understand the output.
    - I feel confident discussing the basics of Argo Workflows and can identify areas where I need further learning.

## 3. Brainstorming (How - What Are All the Things that Could Possibly Need to Be Done to Achieve the outcome?)

- Gather Resources:
    - Official Argo Workflows documentation
    - Tutorials (written, video)
    - Blog posts
    - GitHub repositories with example workflows
    - Community forums or Slack channels
- Understand Core Concepts:
    - What is a workflow?
    - What are the main components of an Argo Workflow?
    - What is the relationship between Argo Workflows and Kubernetes?
    - What are the benefits of using Argo Workflows?
    - What are common use cases for Argo Workflows?
- Setup Local Environment:
    - Install Kubernetes (Minikube or other local option)
    - Install Argo Workflows CLI
    - Configure access to Kubernetes cluster
- Hands-on Practice:
    - Run a "Hello, World!" example
    - Modify existing examples and observe the changes
    - Build a simple workflow from scratch (e.g., a workflow with multiple steps, dependencies)
- Deep Dive into Specific Features (as needed):
    - Different template types (container, script, resource, suspend, DAG)
    - Parameterization
    - Input/Output artifacts
    - Conditional execution
    - Loops
    - Error handling
    - Resource management
- Review and Test Knowledge:
    - Explain concepts to myself or a colleague
    - Try to answer common questions about Argo Workflows
    - Build a more complex workflow to test understanding

## 4. Organizing (Who, When, Where, and what is the Sequence of events?)

- Categorize and Prioritize: Group brainstormed items into logical categories. Prioritize based on dependencies and importance.
    - Phase 1: Fundamentals (1-2 days)
        - Read official documentation (overview, getting started)
        - Watch introductory videos (if available)
        - Understand core concepts and terminology
    - Phase 2: Setup and First Workflow (1 day)
        - Set up a local Kubernetes environment (e.g., Minikube)
        - Install Argo Workflows CLI
        - Run a "Hello, World!" example
    - Phase 3: Workflow Components and Structure (2-3 days)
        - Deep dive into template types, parameters, inputs, outputs.
        - Experiment with different workflow structures (steps, DAGs)
        - Modify example workflows and understand the changes
    - Phase 4: Advanced Features (2-3 days - optional, as needed)
        - Explore advanced features like conditional execution, loops, error handling.
        - Build a more complex workflow to solidify understanding
    - Phase 5: Review and Consolidation (Ongoing)
        - Regularly review and practice concepts.
        - Contribute to online discussions or help others learn.
- Define Next Actions: Break down each category into actionable steps.
- Sequence: Order actions logically.

## 5. Identifying Next Actions (What is the Very next Physical Action Required to Move Each Aspect of the Project forward?)

Here are the immediate next actions, focusing on getting started:

- Schedule: Block time in your calendar for each phase. For now, schedule Phase 1 and Phase 2.
- Documentation: Bookmark the official Argo Workflows documentation: [Argo Workflows - The workflow engine for Kubernetes](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/)
- Video: Search YouTube for "Argo Workflows introduction" and watch a highly-rated video. Choose one to watch within the first block of time.
- Minikube: Research how to install Minikube on your operating system.
- Notes: Create a new document (physical or digital) specifically for taking notes on Argo Workflows.
    Important Considerations:

- Flexibility: This is a plan, not a rigid contract. Be prepared to adjust as you learn and discover new information.
- Iteration: Learning is an iterative process. Don't be afraid to revisit earlier steps as you gain a deeper understanding.
- Community: Engage with the Argo Workflows community for help and support.
    By following this plan, you'll be well on your way to understanding how Argo Workflows works! Good luck!

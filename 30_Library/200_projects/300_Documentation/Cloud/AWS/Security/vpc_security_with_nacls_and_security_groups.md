## VPC Security with NACLs and Security Groups

### Key Points

Security Groups operate at the instance level and are stateful.

[Network Access Control Lists](<Network Access Control Lists>) (NACLs) operate at the subnet level and are stateless.

Security groups are generally easier to manage for instance-specific security.

NACLs and security groups can be used together for multi-layer security.

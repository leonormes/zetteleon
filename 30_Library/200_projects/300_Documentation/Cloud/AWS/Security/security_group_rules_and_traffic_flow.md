## Security Group Rules and Traffic Flow

### Key Points

Security groups allow fine-grained control over traffic at the port, protocol, and IP level.

[Traffic flow](<Traffic flow>) is determined by the rules for inbound and outbound connections.

All rules are deny-by-default: if no rule exists for a certain type of traffic, it is denied.

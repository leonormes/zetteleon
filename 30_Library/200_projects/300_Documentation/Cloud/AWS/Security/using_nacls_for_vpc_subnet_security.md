## Using NACLs for VPC Subnet Security

### Key Points

Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level.

They are stateless, meaning that inbound and outbound rules are evaluated independently.

NACLs can be used alongside security groups to enhance overall security.

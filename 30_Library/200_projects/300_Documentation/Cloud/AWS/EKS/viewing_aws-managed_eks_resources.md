## Viewing AWS-Managed EKS Resources

### Key Points

Use the EKS Console to view summary information like the API server endpoint, security groups, and VPC settings.

AWS CloudFormation provisions the resources for the EKS control plane (such as security groups, subnets).

The AWS CLI can retrieve details about your cluster (e.g., aws eks describe-cluster).

Address the human element – people need to feel valued for this work.

## Explicitly Praise Security Efforts
- This is crucial given your observation. When someone writes particularly secure code, identifies a vulnerability, diligently fixes a security issue, or asks good security questions, *acknowledge and praise it publicly* (in team meetings, chat channels, etc.). "Great catch finding that potential access control issue in the code review, Sarah!" or "Thanks Mark for taking the time to properly configure those IAM permissions."
- Celebrate security "wins" – e.g., passing a security scan, successfully mitigating a threat identified during modelling.
## Security Champions
- Consider a "Security Champions" program, even informally in a small team. Identify one or two developers who show interest (or rotate the role) and provide them with a bit more training or responsibility. They can act as security advocates within the team, help with reviews, and be a point of contact. This distributes knowledge and ownership.
## Gamification (Use with Caution)
- Internal mini-CTFs (Capture The Flags) related to your application, or bug hunts focused on finding security issues (with small rewards or recognition) can sometimes engage developers. Tailor it to your team's culture.
## Foster a "No-Blame" Culture for Security Issues
- If a vulnerability *is* found (ideally internally), focus on the systemic causes and learning from it, not on blaming the individual developer. This encourages people to report issues without fear.
## Connect to Professional Development
- Highlight that security skills are highly valuable and in demand. Learning and applying secure coding practices enhances their own skill sets and career prospects.

## Putting it Together

1. Start Small and Be Persistent: Don't try to implement everything at once. Pick one or two strategies that seem most feasible and impactful for your team.
2. Lead by Example: Consistently demonstrate good security practices in your own work.
3. Be Patient: Changing culture and habits takes time. Keep communicating the importance of security consistently and positively.
4. Tailor Your Approach: You know your team best. Adjust these suggestions based on their personalities, workflow, and technical stack.

It's a journey, but by making threats real, integrating security into the daily workflow, and actively recognizing secure practices, you can significantly improve your team's security posture and motivation. Good luck!

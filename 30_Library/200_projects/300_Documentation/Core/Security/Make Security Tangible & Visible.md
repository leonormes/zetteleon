Security work needs to be seen and valued, not hidden.

## Quantify the Risk (Even Roughly)
- Research potential fines under relevant data protection laws (like GDPR or HIPAA if applicable). Even estimating the potential financial cost of a breach can grab attention. Mention potential reputational damage and loss of trust, which are critical for healthcare systems.
## Frame Security as a Core Feature & Quality Attribute
- Shift the narrative. Security isn't just "insurance"; it's a fundamental requirement for handling medical data. It's about *patient safety*, *trust*, and *system reliability*.
- A breach doesn't just leak data; it can bring the entire service down, directly impacting users (patients, clinicians). Frame security work as essential for uptime and performance.
## Visualize Security Status
- Use dashboards (if available in your tools) to show scan results (SAST, DAST, dependency scans), open vulnerabilities, or configuration compliance. Make the security posture visible.
- Track security tasks on your main project board (Jira, Trello, etc.) alongside feature tasks. Give them story points/estimates like any other work.
## Simple Demonstrations
- If appropriate and safe (use a test environment!), demonstrate a simple exploit relevant to your stack (e.g., a basic SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or accessing an unsecured API endpoint). Seeing how easy some attacks can be is often eye-opening.

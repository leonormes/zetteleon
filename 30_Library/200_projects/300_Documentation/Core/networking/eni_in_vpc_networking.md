## 7.1 ENI In VPC Networking

### Key Points

ENIs allow EC2 instances to connect to subnets within a VPC.

Instances can have multiple ENIs, providing flexibility for dual-homed configurations (e.g., different subnets or security groups per ENI).

ENIs play a key role in traffic routing within the VPC based on route tables.

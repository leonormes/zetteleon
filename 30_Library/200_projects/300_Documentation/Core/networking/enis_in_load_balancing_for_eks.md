## ENIs In Load Balancing for EKS

### Key Points

- ENIs are used by AWS Load Balancers (ALB, NLB) to route traffic to EKS worker nodes.
- Internal load balancers use ENIs to manage traffic between Kubernetes pods and other VPC resources.
- ENIs ensure private load balancing traffic stays within the VPC for private EKS clusters.

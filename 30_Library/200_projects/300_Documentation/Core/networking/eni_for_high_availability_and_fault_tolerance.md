## ENI For High Availability and Fault Tolerance

### Key Points

- ENIs can be detached from one instance and attached to another for failover.
- Multiple ENIs on an instance allow for traffic rerouting in case one interface fails, enhancing fault tolerance.
- This is especially useful for critical workloads in multi-AZ configurations.

### Linked Zettels

- ENI in VPC Networking
- ENI Usage in Multi-AZ Deployments

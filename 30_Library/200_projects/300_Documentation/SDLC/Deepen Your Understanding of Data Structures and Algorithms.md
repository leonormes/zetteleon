- Go Beyond the Basics:
	 - Don't just memorize the names and basic operations. Strive to understand the trade-offs of each data structure. When is a hash table more appropriate than a tree? What are the performance implications of choosing one over the other in different scenarios (e.g., read-heavy vs. write-heavy workloads)?
 - Implement from Scratch (Occasionally):
	 - While you don't need to reinvent the wheel every time, implementing core data structures and algorithms from scratch (or close to it) in any language forces you to confront the underlying mechanics and how data is organized and manipulated in memory. This solidifies your understanding in a way that just using library functions never will.
 - Analyse Time and Space Complexity:
	 - Become proficient in Big O notation. This is essential for understanding how your data structure choices impact performance as data scales. Practice analysing the complexity of your own code and the code of others.
 - Study Different Data Models:
	 - Explore various data models beyond the relational model (SQL). Look into NoSQL databases (document, key-value, graph databases) and understand their strengths and weaknesses. This broadens your perspective on how data can be organized.

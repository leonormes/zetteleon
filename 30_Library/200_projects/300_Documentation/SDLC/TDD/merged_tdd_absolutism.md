## TDD Absolutism

Absolutists maintain that TDD must be practiced in its purest form or not at all, rejecting any compromise or partial adoption.

Key beliefs:

- Strict adherence to TDD principles is essential
- Partial adoption is worse than no adoption
- There is only one right way to practice TDD
- Compromises undermine the entire methodology

Common expression: "Do it right or don't do it at all."

## TDD Aesthetic Idealism

"In love with the beauty of TDD as a concept, but not its practice"

- Appreciates TDD like fine art - from a distance
- Writes blog posts about TDD best practices
- Has a perfectly configured test setup that never gets used

[TDD Performative Virtueism](TDD%20Performative%20Virtueism.md)

## TDD Agnosticism

Agnostics maintain uncertainty about TDD's effectiveness while remaining open to evidence and experience.

Key beliefs:

- Uncertainty about benefits is acceptable
- Evidence should be evaluated objectively
- Judgment should be suspended
- Both success and failure stories have merit

Common expression: "We can't really know if TDD works, but we can keep learning."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Aspirational Delusion

"Genuinely believes they practice TDD despite evidence to the contrary"

- Has convinced themselves that "thinking about tests" counts as TDD
- "I'll add the tests right after this feature" becomes a permanent state
- Maintains a self-image as a TDD practitioner while never actually writing tests first

## TDD Counterarguments

Content: Advocates of TDD argue that it provides numerous benefits, including improved code design, reduced debugging time, increased confidence in refactoring, and better documentation, even in the face of changing requirements.

Context: Presenting a contrasting viewpoint to TDD nihilism.

[TDD Nihilism](notes/TDD%20Nihilism.md)

## TDD Cynicism

Cynics reject TDD without practical experience, viewing it as another passing trend in software development. Their stance is based on preconceived notions rather than empirical evidence.

Key beliefs:

- TDD is consultant-driven hype
- The methodology is unnecessarily complex
- Traditional testing approaches are sufficient
- TDD is a solution in search of a problem

Common expression: "It's just another buzzword that will fade away like all the others."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Determinism

Determinists believe that TDD's success or failure is predetermined by organizational culture and team dynamics, regardless of individual effort.

Key beliefs:

- Team culture dictates TDD success
- Individual efforts cannot overcome organizational resistance
- Success requires systemic support
- Cultural alignment is prerequisite for TDD adoption

Common expression: "Culture eats practice for breakfast."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Dualism

Dualists see a strict separation between test-driven code and legacy code, with no middle ground possible.

Key beliefs:

- Code is either properly test-driven or it isn't
- No middle ground exists
- Clear separation between good and bad practices
- Binary view of code quality

Common expression: "There are only two types of code: test-driven and legacy."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Empiricism

Empiricists base their TDD stance purely on measurable results and data, rejecting theoretical arguments or anecdotal evidence.

Key beliefs:

- Only measurable outcomes matter
- Data should drive testing decisions
- Anecdotal evidence is insufficient
- Metrics determine success

Common expression: "Show me the numbers that prove TDD works."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Existentialism

Existentialists believe each developer must find their own meaning and path in TDD practice, emphasizing personal responsibility and authenticity.

Key beliefs:

- Personal journey of discovery
- Individual responsibility for practice
- Authenticity in adoption
- Freedom to choose approach

Common expression: "Each developer must find their own testing truth."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Fatalism

Fatalists believe their codebase is destined to remain untested, viewing poor quality as an inevitable condition that cannot be changed.

Key beliefs:

- Change is impossible in established codebases
- Poor quality is inevitable
- Legacy code will always win
- Resistance is futile

Common expression: "Our codebase is too far gone for tests now."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Hedonism

Hedonists approach TDD based on what brings immediate satisfaction and enjoyment, avoiding difficult or unpleasant testing scenarios.

Key beliefs:

- Only write tests that feel good to write
- Avoid difficult testing scenarios
- Developer happiness is the primary metric
- Testing should be enjoyable

Common expression: "If it's not fun to test, it's not worth testing."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Holism

Holists view TDD as inseparable from the entire software development process, believing it cannot be evaluated or practiced in isolation.

Key beliefs:

- Testing is integral to development
- Can't separate testing from other practices
- All aspects of development are interconnected
- Quality is systemic

Common expression: "You can't look at testing in isolation from the whole development process."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Hypocrisy

This behavior is particularly interesting because it reflects a broader phenomenon in software development (and human nature) where our stated beliefs and actual practices don't align. It's similar to:

- Developers who advocate for detailed documentation but never write any
- Architects who preach microservices while building monoliths
- Engineers who emphasize code review importance but merge their own PRs

The gap between advocacy and practice often comes from:

- Understanding the benefits intellectually but lacking the discipline to follow through
- Wanting to be seen as following best practices without investing the effort
- Genuine intention to do better but failing to overcome ingrained habits
- Social pressure to advocate for accepted best practices regardless of personal practice

Perhaps we could call the entire phenomenon "TDD Cognitive Dissonance" - the ability to simultaneously hold strong beliefs about the necessity of TDD while actively avoiding its practice!

[TDD Methodological Dualism](notes/TDD%20Methodological%20Dualism.md)

[TDD Aspirational Delusion](notes/TDD%20Aspirational%20Delusion.md)

## TDD Methodological Dualism

"Maintains two separate realities: the one they preach and the one they practice"

- Mind believes in TDD, hands write untested code
- Experienced at explaining away the contradiction
- "Do as I say, not as I do" elevated to a philosophy

[TDD Hypocrisy](TDD%20Hypocrisy.md)

## TDD Nihilism

TDD nihilists believe that writing tests first is fundamentally meaningless in the chaotic reality of software development. They argue that all code is temporary and will eventually be rewritten or replaced, making upfront testing efforts futile.

Key beliefs:

- Tests are meaningless in the face of production chaos
- All code is destined for replacement or obsolescence
- Requirements change renders tests obsolete quickly
- The effort invested in TDD provides no lasting value

Common expression: "Why bother with tests when everything will change tomorrow anyway?"

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

Content: TDD nihilists believe that the practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) is pointless due to the ever-changing nature of software and its requirements, leading to code that is constantly being rewritten or replaced, rendering initial testing efforts futile.

Context: Describing a skeptical perspective on the value of Test-Driven Development.

[Benefits of TDD](notes/Benefits%20of%20TDD.md)

## TDD Performative Virtueism

"Signals TDD virtue in public while not driving design with tests in private"

- Loudly advocates for TDD in meetings
- Shares TDD articles on social media
- Quietly disables test runs in their CI pipeline

[TDD Hypocrisy](TDD%20Hypocrisy.md)

I have linked this as people can be curating their public image by saying they do TDD but actually not doing it. This could be for professional status through social media. This can be seen as playing the professinal

## TDD Platonic Evangelism

"One who preaches the perfect forms but dwells in the cave of untested code"

- Speaks eloquently of TDD's virtues while typing `git commit -m "will add tests later"`
- Can perfectly describe the red-green-refactor cycle but hasn't seen a red test in months
- Their actual code and their spoken philosophy exist in separate realms

[TDD Hypocrisy](TDD%20Hypocrisy.md)

## TDD Platonism

Platonists see TDD as perfect in theory but unattainable in practice. They believe in an ideal form of TDD that exists only in books and blog posts but can never be fully realized in the real world.

Key beliefs:

- Perfect TDD exists as an ideal form
- Real-world implementation always falls short
- The gap between theory and practice is unbridgeable
- The pure methodology is corrupted by practical constraints

Common expression: "The theory is beautiful, but reality never matches up."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Pragmatism

Pragmatists accept TDD's benefits while acknowledging its practical limitations. They adapt the methodology to their context while maintaining its core principles.

Key beliefs:

- TDD provides value when implemented consistently
- The methodology can be adapted to different contexts
- Results matter more than dogmatic adherence
- Continuous improvement is more important than perfection

Common expression: "Take what works, adapt what doesn't, and focus on results."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Relativism

Relativists argue that TDD's value varies entirely based on context, rejecting universal rules or best practices.

Key beliefs:

- Different projects require different approaches
- No universal rules apply to all situations
- TDD's effectiveness varies by team and project
- Context determines methodology

Common expression: "It depends on your specific situation."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Skepticism

Unlike nihilists, skeptics have attempted TDD but remain unconvinced of its benefits through direct experience. Their doubts stem from empirical attempts rather than philosophical rejection.

Key beliefs:

- TDD's promised benefits are unattainable in practice
- Personal attempts at implementation have failed to deliver value
- Success stories may represent survivorship bias
- The methodology might work for others but hasn't worked for them

Common expression: "I've tried it thoroughly, but I can't reproduce the promised results."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Sophistry

"Masters of TDD rhetoric who fail to practice what they preach"

- Can win any argument about why TDD is essential
- Skilled at making others feel guilty for not testing
- Their own commits mysteriously lack test files

[TDD Hypocrisy](TDD%20Hypocrisy.md)

## TDD Stoicism

Stoics focus on controlling what they can in their TDD practice while accepting external constraints and imperfections. They emphasize personal discipline and continuous improvement regardless of circumstances.

Key beliefs:

- Focus on what's within your control
- Accept imperfect conditions while maintaining practice
- Personal discipline matters more than external factors
- Continuous improvement is the path forward

Common expression: "Control what you can, accept what you can't, and keep improving."

[Philosophical Perspectives on Test-Driven Development](Philosophical%20Perspectives%20on%20Test-Driven%20Development.md)

## TDD Syncretism

Syncretists combine elements from different testing approaches, creating a personalized hybrid methodology that incorporates TDD principles selectively.

Key beliefs:

- Multiple testing approaches have value
- Best practices can be combined
- Adaptation and integration are key
- No single approach is complete

Common expression: "Take the best from each approach and make it your own."

## TDD Utilitarianism

Utilitarians evaluate TDD solely based on its practical benefits and costs, focusing on measurable outcomes rather than theoretical principles.

Key beliefs:

- Value is measured in business outcomes
- Cost-benefit analysis should drive testing decisions
- Practical results trump theoretical benefits
- Testing effort should align with business value

Common expression: "Only test what provides measurable benefit."

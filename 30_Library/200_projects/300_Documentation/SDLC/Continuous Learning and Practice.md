- Read Classic Texts: Books like "Cracking the Coding Interview" and "Introduction to Algorithms" are excellent resources for deepening your understanding of data structures and algorithms.
 - Study Open Source Projects: Examine how well-respected open-source projects organize their data. Look for patterns and best practices.
 - Contribute to Open Source: Contributing to open source gives you the opportunity to work on real-world projects and learn from experienced developers.
 - Practice Regularly: Data-centric design is a skill that requires constant practice. The more you do it, the better you'll become.
Example: Designing a Library Management System
Instead of thinking "I'll use Java and ArrayLists," start with:
 - Entities: Book, Member, Loan
 - Attributes: Book (title, author, ISBN), Member (name, ID), Loan (book, member, due date)
 - Relationships: A book can be loaned to a member. A member can borrow multiple books.
 - Data Access: Search for books by title/author, find overdue loans, list books borrowed by a member.
Now you can consider data structures (hash map for book lookups, linked list for loans, etc.) and language. This is data-centric design.

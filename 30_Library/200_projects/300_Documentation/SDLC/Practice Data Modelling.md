- Real-World Problems: The best way to improve is by doing. Take real-world problems (or even hypothetical ones) and try to model the data involved. Don't jump into code right away. Instead, sketch out the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.
 - Diagramming: Use diagrams (e.g., UML class diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize your data models. This helps you clarify your thinking and communicate your design to others.
 - Consider Data Access Patterns: Think about how the data will be accessed and manipulated. Will it be read frequently? Will it be updated often? This will influence your choice of data structures and how you organize the data.
 - Refactor Existing Code: Look at existing codebases (even your own) and try to refactor them with a more data-centric approach. Can you improve the organization of the data? Can you simplify the code by using more appropriate data structures?

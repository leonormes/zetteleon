- Pseudocode: Before writing code in a specific language, try to express your logic in pseudocode. This forces you to think about the algorithm and data structures independently of language syntax.
 - Focus on Concepts: When learning a new language, try to identify the underlying concepts that are common to other languages. For example, most languages have some form of list or array. Understanding the commonalities will make it easier to learn new languages and transfer your skills.
 - Read Code in Different Languages: Exposure to different languages broadens your perspective and helps you appreciate different ways of solving the same problem. You'll start to see patterns and common abstractions.
 - Design APIs: Designing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) forces you to think about data and how it will be exposed and consumed. This is a valuable exercise in data-centric design.

🔑 Principles of a Low-Energy Productivity System

A robust system is built around the "tired-me" as the primary user to ensure survival during periods of exhaustion or low motivation.

1. ⚡ Prioritise Low-Friction Capture

- One-Tap Capture: The process of getting an idea or task into the system must be instant and require minimal effort.
- No Categories First: Avoid mandatory fields, tags, or complex structures during initial entry. This eliminates decision fatigue when energy is low.

2. 🎯 Simplify Action & Visibility

- Single "Next" List: Replace multiple project queues with one simple, consolidated list to reduce the effort of deciding what to work on next.
- Focus on the Next Possible Step: The system must clearly show the single, immediate action that can be taken, even without full context.

3. ✨ Embrace Forgiveness and Recovery

- Forgive Neglect: The system must be able to withstand going untouched for a few days without losing important information.
- Quick Recovery: When energy returns, there should be "no guilt backlog to clean up"—the user should be able to jump straight back into the next actionable item.

4. 🚫 Ban Maintenance Debt

- "Add First, Sort Later" Rule: Adopt a strict policy against rearranging or tidying tasks/notes immediately. This prevents maintenance from becoming a form of procrastination.
- Trust the Reminders: The system should rely on automated surfacing of critical information (like reminders) rather than demanding manual review or micromanagement.
Core Takeaway
A system that only works when you're motivated is a hobby, not a reliable system. Its core function is to help your workflow survive fatigue and provide a clear path forward when motivation is gone.
Would you like to explore any of these principles in more detail, or perhaps think about how you could apply the "Add First, Sort Later" rule to a specific part of your workflow?

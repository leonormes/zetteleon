Here's a more concise and clear articulation of the underlying sentiment:

"I'm pursuing a goal that I can't even clearly define. It's an abstract longing without real substance, yet I can't seem to let it go. I'm trapped in a repetitive, unproductive pattern—like an instinct that no longer serves its original purpose. Am I actually making any meaningful progress, or just spinning my wheels?"

The key elements I've preserved are:

- Undefined, vague desire
- Sense of being stuck in a habitual, unproductive cycle
- Questioning the purpose and effectiveness of one's actions
- The animal metaphor of instinctual but pointless behavior

The revision simplifies the language, makes the metaphor more direct, and clarifies the underlying emotional and psychological struggle.

Would you like me to refine it further or explore the idea from a different angle?

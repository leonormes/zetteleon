*The Goal: To use your connected notes to build larger arguments and summaries.*

This is where you zoom out from the atomic level to see the bigger picture that your notes are forming.

**The Method: Creating Structure Notes**

1. **Identify Emerging Themes**: As you connect notes, you will see clusters of ideas forming around a central topic.  
2. **Create a Structure Note**: A structure note is a higher-level note that organises and summarises a collection of atomic notes. It's your "wiki-style" entry, but it's built from the ground up through your thinking process.  
3. **Write the Synthesis**: Use the structure note to articulate the overarching argument or story that the linked notes tell. This is your "explanatory" writing, built upon the foundation of your "exploratory" work.

**Outcome**: A coherent understanding of a complex topic, captured in a structure note that serves as a map of your thinking.

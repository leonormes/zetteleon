## A Concept Map for a Flourishing Human: Bessie's Skills

Creating a concept map together is a brilliant, hands-on way to help Bessie visualise her own growth in a positive and holistic way. It shifts the focus from "things you must do for school" to "all the wonderful parts that make up YOU".

Here is a comprehensive list that combines the [[Character and Virtue MOC|VIA Character Strengths]] with the core skills and values from the English National Curriculum, and broader abilities needed for a happy, healthy life in modern society. You and Bessie can use this as a "pick list" to build your map. You can write "Bessie" in the centre and then draw branches out to these different areas.

This approach aligns with the [[VIA Character Strengths]] framework, which identifies six core virtues that contribute to human flourishing:

- [[VIA Virtue of Wisdom]] - Cognitive strengths for acquiring and using knowledge
- [[VIA Virtue of Courage]] - Emotional strengths for accomplishing goals despite opposition
- [[VIA Virtue of Humanity]] - Interpersonal strengths for tending and befriending others
- [[VIA Virtue of Justice]] - Civic strengths that underlie healthy community life
- [[VIA Virtue of Temperance]] - Strengths that protect against excess and impulsiveness
- [[VIA Virtue of Transcendence]] - Strengths that forge connections to the larger universe

Here are all the skills, strengths and qualities you are building as you grow. Let's map them out to see all the incredible parts of you!

[[Heart & Friendship Skills (Your Kind Heart)]]

[[Inner Strength & Resilience Skills (Your Strong Spirit)]]

Bessie is described as inquisitive, caring, and thoughtful. This innate curiosity drives her to explore and understand topics deeply.

She enjoys asking "why" and digging deeper into stories and concepts, which is fundamental to historical and scientific thinking.

## Character Development Connection

This natural inquisitiveness aligns strongly with the [[VIA Virtue of Wisdom]], particularly:

- **[[VIA Virtue of Wisdom|Curiosity]]**: Taking an interest in ongoing experience for its own sake; exploring and discovering
- **[[VIA Virtue of Wisdom|Love of Learning]]**: Mastering new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge
- **[[VIA Virtue of Wisdom|Judgement (Critical Thinking)]]**: Thinking things through and examining them from all sides; not jumping to conclusions

This strength can be cultivated through the [[Character and Virtue MOC|VIA Character Strengths framework]] to develop deeper wisdom and perspective beyond academic achievement.

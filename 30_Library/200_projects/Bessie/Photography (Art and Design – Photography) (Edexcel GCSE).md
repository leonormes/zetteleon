title: Photography (Art and Design – Photography) (Edexcel GCSE)

- Curriculum Content: Students learn to use DSLR cameras, edit images with Adobe Photoshop, understand studio lighting, composition, and camera techniques, and research photographers to create meaningful photographic images. Assessment is via an internal portfolio (60%) and an externally controlled assessment (40%).
- Alignment with Bessie's Profile:
  - Strengths: This is another subject chosen by Bessie that plays to her strengths and creativity. It aligns with her interest in special effects make-up for films, as photography is integral to visual arts and media. Her visual discrimination skills would be beneficial.
  - Learning Needs: Similar to Art, the practical and portfolio-based nature reduces reliance on traditional written exams and extensive copying, which would mitigate some of her challenges. Digital editing involves fine motor skills, and her hypermobility issues are being addressed through physiotherapy and occupational therapy, with specific recommendations for writing tools that might translate to digital work.

- "You mentioned you sometimes don't remember things. When you're learning something new in maths, what helps you remember it for longer? For example, seeing diagrams, writing it down, or hearing it explained more than once?" - *This acknowledges her working memory challenges and probes for effective learning strategies that might counteract them.*
- "If the teacher explains something, and you forget it soon after, what do you think would help you to keep that information in your mind? Like having notes printed out, or a quick video to re-watch?" - *Focuses on practical adaptations, such as providing printed materials which she has noted helps her.*
- "Do you find it easier to learn maths when you can connect it to your interests, like special effects, horses, or film?" - *Leveraging her passions can boost engagement and focus, which are challenging with ADHD.*

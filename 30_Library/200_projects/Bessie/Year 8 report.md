Based on the "79403_Assessment Report Y08 - Summer Term 3.Pdf" and other provided sources, here's a detailed analysis of Bessie's education so far:

**Bessie's Progress in Year 8 (Summer 2024/25 Progress Report)**

The "79403_Assessment Report Y08 - Summer Term 3.Pdf" is a progress report for Bessie Ormes, Form 8D1, as of Summer 2024/25.

- **Attendance & Lates:** Bessie's attendance is 89.19% as of July 16, 2025, and she has 4 lates. An attendance below 93% is considered unsatisfactory. Her father has noted recent concerns and patterns in her attendance, including "psychosomatic" elements of feeling unwell, which resolve once she is home. Her attendance has also been described as not looking great.
- **Subject-Specific Performance (Scores and Grades):** The report uses "Score Levels" for homework and attitude to learning, with 4 being "Emerging" (poor presentation, slow to start, not self-disciplined, homework regularly late/not completed) and 3 being "Developing" (not fully organised, may not always push themselves).
  - **Art:** Current Grade 2.6, Expected 2.9, Forecast 2. Homework Attitude 2, Attitude to Learning 2.
  - **Physical Education (PE):** Current Grade 2.3, Expected 2.6, Forecast 2. Homework Attitude 1, Attitude to Learning 2.
  - **Science:** Current Grade 2.3, Expected 2.6, Forecast 1. Homework Attitude 2, Attitude to Learning 3.
  - **Technology:** Current Grade 3.9, Expected 3.9, Forecast 3. Homework Attitude 2, Attitude to Learning 2.

**Overall Educational Context and Challenges**

Bessie Ormes is currently in Year 8 at Belfairs Academy. She has been on the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) register since her arrival in Year 7. The school states that 10% of its students are supported on the SEND register, with 9% according to another report.

1. **Diagnoses and Learning Needs:**
   - **ADHD:** Bessie was formally diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) on January 29, 2024. Her mother reported difficulties in concentrating, especially on tasks that are not of interest to Bessie, and forgetfulness, since Bessie was around 6-7 years old. ADHD is considered a major factor in her struggles to concentrate or remain focused in lessons.
   - **Dyslexia-related needs:** She has dyslexia-related needs. She finds reading and writing difficult. Her CAT4 scores show a mild preference for verbal over spatial learning, with a relative weakness in spatial concepts. This impacts subjects like Science, Technology, Design, and Geography.
   - **Anxiety:** Bessie experiences anxiety, mainly in school situations, which her mother reports as currently manageable. Anxiety is also linked to her academic struggles, particularly in Maths. Her parents have noted that Bessie can be "very anxious". She often feels overwhelmed by noise and sensory environments.
   - **Irlen Syndrome/Visual Stress Syndrome:** She has a diagnosis of Meares-Irlen/Visual Stress Syndrome, requiring resources printed on blue paper and blue paper books.
   - **Other difficulties:** She struggles with spelling, phonological working memory, and can be easily distracted. Maths is consistently highlighted as an area of difficulty. She has hypermobility issues and is under physiotherapy for this, with a referral to occupational therapy. She is also on the ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) assessment pathway.

2. **Key Stage 2 (KS2) Performance:**
   - At the end of Key Stage 2 (Year 6), Bessie took national curriculum assessments in English grammar, punctuation and spelling, English reading, and mathematics. Her KS2 Reading Test Scaled Score was 105, and her KS2 Maths Scaled Score was 91. These scores help measure attainment and identify where pupils may need additional support. The secondary school (Belfairs Academy) can access these results to plan support for new pupils.
   - In a teacher screening assessment for ADHD in Year 6, Bessie's attainment in Reading, Writing, and Science was reported as "Working at Expected Levels", while Maths was "Working over a year behind expected levels".

3. **Current Support and Inconsistencies:**
   - Bessie has an Individual Support Plan (ISP) in place, which is regularly reviewed with targets set.
   - **Laptop Use:** She uses a school laptop for writing, as recommended by the occupational therapist. This is explicitly recommended for longer writing tasks and summative tests, and for exam practice to bypass spelling difficulties associated with dyslexia.
   - **Blue Paper:** She uses blue paper as advised by Forbes Opticians. However, there is documented inconsistency in teachers providing printed materials and blue paper.
   - **Time-Out Pass:** Bessie frequently uses a 2-minute time-out pass to access a quieter room or the sensory room's cubby to manage sensory overload and anxiety. There have been instances where teachers have confiscated her time-out pass due to perceived misuse.
   - **Counselling:** She has been referred for school counselling and has attended sessions. Bessie has also had involvement with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) Crisis Team following an overdose incident in June 2024, and was referred to the Southend SET CAMHS community team for follow-up support.
   - **General Support Strategies:** Her learning profile and support strategies include extra time for processing, breaking large tasks into achievable chunks, visual and verbal prompts, opportunities for independent task completion, prompting focus, allowing her to discuss worries, and using a laptop for writing. Positive praise for effort is also emphasized.
   - **Inconsistent Implementation:** A core concern from Bessie's parents is the "critical and damaging inconsistency" in how her needs are being met, with the effectiveness of her support being dependent on individual teachers. Some teachers reportedly blame her for not listening if she doesn't understand and even tell her to leave the classroom. There is too much reliance on copying from the board, which is difficult for her.

4. **Behavior and Attitudes:**
   - The Ofsted report for Belfairs Academy rated "Behaviour and attitudes" as 'Good'. Pupils reportedly behave well in lessons and around school, and the school is a "busy and vibrant space" where pupils get along.
   - However, internal school communications and parental feedback reveal a more challenging picture. Bessie has been frequently reported for truancy and leaving lessons without permission. Her behavior has been described as defiant, argumentative, and sometimes rude. There's a notable difference in her behavior at home versus at school, suggesting "masking" of her struggles.
   - Her behavior and performance have reportedly declined recently, and her disengagement and behavioural issues are seen as a "direct result of this inconsistent and, at times, negative environment".
   - Bessie is motivated by praise and wants to do well.

5. **Student and Parent Perspectives:**
   - Bessie enjoys school and has friends. She particularly likes Art and History. She aspires to be a special effects make-up artist for films.
   - She feels unhappy at school and finds it hard to trust people, preferring her small social circle.
   - She believes everything is "perfectly fine" but finds elements annoying and feels she needs more time to complete tasks. She would prefer to stay at Belfairs rather than change schools.
   - She dislikes reading, writing, and Maths lessons because they are difficult, and PE lessons because she doesn't understand what to do. She also dislikes talking in front of people.
   - Her parents are concerned that she is being "let down by a lack of consistent, whole-school understanding". They feel powerless and frustrated when her needs are not met.

6. **School Leadership and Teaching Quality:**
   - Belfairs Academy received a 'Requires Improvement' rating from Ofsted in June 2024 for "Quality of education" and "Leadership and management," a downgrade from its previous 'Good' rating in 2013.
   - Ofsted noted "weaknesses in how the curriculum is taught mean that pupils do not achieve as well as they should", and that "some teaching is not focused on making sure that pupils understand and remember long term the knowledge". Teaching is not "alert and responsive to mistakes".
   - The school's leadership is criticized for not taking "timely and credible steps to assure itself that pupils' outcomes... are likely to improve".
   - Despite these criticisms, the school's principal, Bev Williams, stated that they "in no way agree with the outcome of this inspection".

**Summary of Bessie's Educational Journey So Far:**

Bessie Ormes is a Year 8 student at Belfairs Academy with diagnosed ADHD and dyslexia-related needs, compounded by anxiety, Irlen syndrome, and hypermobility. Her academic journey has been marked by inconsistent support, particularly regarding adaptations for her learning profile. While she shows strengths in creative subjects like Art and English (creative writing, verbal responses), and has a passion for history and films, she struggles significantly with Maths and finds copying from the board and extended writing challenging due to her dyslexia and working memory issues. Her attendance is a concern, and her behavior at school often involves truancy and defiance, contrasting sharply with her behavior at home. This is attributed, in part, to inconsistent teacher support and a school environment that does not consistently adapt to her needs or foster engagement, leading to frustration and disengagement. Despite the school's commitment to SEND provision and some positive individual teacher efforts (e.g., History teacher using blue paper and varied methods), overall implementation of her Individual Support Plan appears to be lacking consistency, aligning with the school's recent 'Requires Improvement' Ofsted rating for quality of education and leadership.

For your next step, we could delve into Bessie's projected GCSE outcomes based on her CAT4 scores and compare them with her current performance, to identify specific academic risks and opportunities for intervention.

Bessie's educational journey so far reveals a complex interplay of intellectual strengths, specific learning difficulties, and significant emotional challenges, all set within a school environment that has faced criticism for inconsistent quality of education and leadership. Analyzing her projected GCSE outcomes based on CAT4 scores against her current performance highlights critical academic risks and opportunities for targeted intervention.

## Bessie's Cognitive Profile (CAT4 Scores)

Bessie's CAT4 scores, taken on September 12, 2023, at age 11:05, provide insights into her learning preferences and potential.

- **Mean SAS: 96**
- **Verbal SAS: 107**
- **Quantitative SAS: 78**
- **Non-Verbal SAS: 107**
- **Spatial SAS: 93**

Her profile indicates a "mild preference for verbal over spatial learning". While her verbal and non-verbal abilities are in the average to high-average range, she shows a "relative weakness in her understanding of spatial concepts" and quantitative abilities. This suggests she may thrive with verbally-based material but might find subjects requiring visualisation, diagrams, 3D objects, or mind maps more challenging. The report recommends a fast pace of instruction, tasks that develop independent study skills, sequential learning, and extension activities requiring hypotheses, predictions, and testing outcomes. It also encourages creative writing, discussion, and debate.

## Projected GCSE Outcomes Based on CAT4 Indicators

The CAT4 report provides 'Most likely grade achieved' and 'If challenged' grade projections for various GCSE subjects.

**Compulsory Subjects:**

- **English Language:** Most likely grade 5.8, If challenged grade 6.5.
- **English Literature:** Most likely grade 5.8, If challenged grade 6.5.
- **Mathematics:** Most likely grade 4.3, If challenged grade 5.0.
- **Combined Science:** Most likely grade 4.8, If challenged grade 5.5.

**Optional Subjects (Selected by Bessie):**

- **Art & Design:** Most likely grade 4.9, If challenged grade 5.6.
- **History:** Most likely grade 5.1, If challenged grade 5.8.
- **Photography:** (Not explicitly listed, but under Art & Design, likely similar or higher due to her interest).
- **Philosophy & Ethics (Religious Studies):** Most likely grade 4.4, If challenged grade 5.1.
- **Film Studies:** (Not explicitly listed, but linked to Art/Photography and her interests).

## Comparison with Current Performance and Challenges (Year 8 Summer Term 3)

Bessie's Year 8 Summer Term 3 progress report (as of July 16, 2025) provides her current grades, expected grades, and forecast grades in some subjects. It also details her homework attitude and attitude to learning using a 4-level scale (4=Emerging/poor, 3=Developing/not fully organised).

**1. English Language & Literature:**

- **CAT4 Projection:** Mid-range (5.8 to 6.5).
- **Current Performance:** The Year 8 report doesn't provide specific English grades, but the June 2025 review states she produces "thoughtful and creative English work" when focused and "enjoys creative writing". Her 1:1 verbal responses are "perceptive". This aligns with her strong verbal SAS score.
- **Challenges:** Despite verbal strengths, Bessie has dyslexia-related needs, struggles with reading and writing, spelling, and phonological working memory. The English Language GCSE is 100% written examination, heavily reliant on reading unseen texts under timed conditions and high demands on spelling and grammar. English Literature is closed-book, requiring memorisation and analysis of dense language.
- **Discrepancy:** Her KS2 Reading Scaled Score was 105, which is at the expected level. However, observations from 2021 noted she "struggled with focus and sitting still" and "appeared to skip words she was unsure of without trying" when reading. This suggests a gap between raw ability and consistent performance due to underlying processing issues and ADHD.

**2. Mathematics:**

- **CAT4 Projection:** Low-mid range (4.3 to 5.0).
- **Current Performance:** Maths is consistently identified as "an area of difficulty" and a "fundamental misunderstanding of her memory and processing challenges". Her KS2 Maths Scaled Score was 91, which is "working over a year behind expected levels" in Year 6. She feels "overwhelmed" and "frustrated" in Maths. Her father noted recent improvement in Maths, but her current report does not include a Maths grade.
- **Alignment:** The CAT4 quantitative score (78) is low and aligns with her reported difficulties. This confirms Maths as a significant academic risk.

**3. Science:**

- **CAT4 Projection:** Mid-range (4.8 to 5.5).
- **Current Performance:** Her current grade is 2.3, expected 2.6, and forecast 1. Her Attitude to Learning is 3 ('Developing' - not fully organised, may not always push themselves), and Homework Attitude is 2 ('Developing'). This indicates she is performing *below* her expected and forecast grades.
- **Challenges:** Her dyslexia-related needs and lower spatial ability impact Science. Science GCSE (Combined Science) involves vast content, terminology, multi-step problem-solving, and spatial aspects.
- **Discrepancy:** Her current Year 8 performance (2.3) is significantly below the CAT4 projection (4.8-5.5), indicating a potential underachievement that needs immediate attention. Her science group was changed in March 2025 due to it not working for her.

**4. Art & Design / Photography:**

- **CAT4 Projection:** Mid-range (4.9 to 5.6) for Art & Design. Photography is a related subject.
- **Current Performance:** Art current grade 2.6, expected 2.9, forecast 2. Homework Attitude 2, Attitude to Learning 2. This suggests she is performing *below* expectations, but her passions for Art and Film are significant strengths. The June 2025 review noted "good sewing on her final textiles piece" and "thoughtful and creative English work". Her History, Values, PE, and Art teachers all report "Amazing, good standard, S&C completed, intelligent and perceptive, great work ethic and wants to do well" when she is in the "right frame of mind".
- **Alignment:** Her interest and creative strengths align with the GCSE subjects she has chosen, which are primarily coursework-based (Art and Photography are 100% NEA). This assessment method is inherently suited to students like Bessie who benefit from developing work over time rather than high-stakes, timed exams, and allows visual expression, bypassing dyslexia challenges.

**5. History:**

- **CAT4 Projection:** Mid-range (5.1 to 5.8).
- **Current Performance:** Not provided in the Summer Term 3 report, but the June 2025 review mentions History as a subject where she performs well when in the "right frame of mind". Bessie herself likes History the most. She explicitly noted a History lesson as highly engaging due to varied methods.
- **Alignment:** Her inquisitive nature and interest in facts are strengths for History.

**6. Physical Education (PE):**

- **Current Performance:** Current grade 2.3, expected 2.6, forecast 2. Homework Attitude 1, Attitude to Learning 2. This indicates an 'Emerging' attitude to homework (regularly late/not completed) and 'Developing' attitude to learning. Bessie dislikes PE lessons because she "doesn't understand what to do".
- **Discrepancy:** Her current grade and attitude are low.

**7. Technology:**

- **Current Performance:** Current grade 3.9, expected 3.9, forecast 3. Homework Attitude 2, Attitude to Learning 2. This is the highest current grade reported, and her expected and forecast grades are also relatively high.
- **Challenges:** Despite the good grade, her CAT4 indicates a relative weakness in spatial concepts which may impact Design & Technology.

## Specific Academic Risks

1. **Underperformance in Core Subjects (Maths, Science, English):**
   - **Maths:** Her lowest CAT4 score (Quantitative 78) and consistently reported difficulties from KS2 onward make Maths a primary risk for failing to achieve a passing grade, which is often a prerequisite for future education and employment.
   - **Science:** Her current Year 8 grades are significantly below her CAT4 projections, indicating underachievement. The vast content and mathematical applications pose a challenge due to her cognitive profile.
   - **English Language:** While her verbal skills are strong, her dyslexia-related needs and difficulties with timed, written examinations and spelling/grammar pose a risk to achieving her projected grades.

2. **Inconsistent Implementation of SEND Support:** The "critical and damaging inconsistency" in how her IEP/ISP is applied by teachers directly hinders her access to the curriculum and exacerbates her learning difficulties and anxiety. This includes issues with providing blue paper, printed resources, and consistent laptop use. This inconsistent support is identified as a direct cause of her disengagement and behavioral issues.
3. **Anxiety and Emotional Dysregulation:** Bessie's anxiety, particularly in school settings and with subjects like Maths, leads to disengagement, feeling overwhelmed, and potentially "psychosomatic" illnesses affecting her attendance. Her tendency to "mask" her struggles at school means her true level of distress and difficulty may not be apparent to teachers, leading to inadequate support.
4. **Behavioral Issues and Attendance:** Her truancy, defiance, and leaving lessons without permission are significant risks to her learning. Her attendance rate of 89.19% is "unsatisfactory". These behaviors are linked to her disengagement resulting from inconsistent support. Missing chunks of lessons will create knowledge gaps.
5. **Lack of Clear Feedback on Progress:** Bessie reports "no real sense of how she is performing in her subjects," which means she "cannot improve, and it leaves her feeling lost and guessing at her own progress". This directly aligns with the Ofsted finding that the school "has not thought enough about how to check what pupils know and understand" leading to repeated mistakes and pupils struggling to commit knowledge to long-term memory.

## Opportunities for Intervention

1. **Prioritise and Leverage Strengths (Art, History, Film Studies, Photography):** Bessie's passions and talents in creative and humanities subjects are major assets. These subjects (Art & Design, Photography, Film Studies) are largely coursework-based, which suits her learning profile and reduces exam anxiety. Interventions should link her interests to other subjects to foster engagement and make learning more meaningful.
2. **Formalise and Systematise Accommodations:**
   - **Exam Access Arrangements:** Given her ADHD, dyslexia, and processing difficulties, she is entitled to 25% extra time in exams. A computer reader for reading-heavy exams (except English Language Reading) and a laptop for all extended writing (with spell-check off in exams if she can type competently) are also crucial. Modified enlarged papers printed on blue paper should be standard.
   - **In-Class Support:** Consistent provision of blue paper and printed resources is paramount to reduce copying from the board. Laptop use for all longer writing tasks should be guaranteed.
   - **"Learning Passport":** A student-friendly summary of her accommodations can empower her to advocate for herself and ensure teachers are aware of her needs.

3. **Targeted Academic Support Strategies:**
   - **Chunking and Scaffolding:** Break down large tasks, concepts, and revision into smaller, achievable chunks for all subjects, particularly Maths and Science.
   - **Multi-Sensory Learning:** Utilise visual aids (mind maps, storyboards, diagrams, timelines), verbal explanations, and active learning techniques to complement written materials, especially in Maths and Science where her spatial ability is weaker.
   - **Addressing Maths Anxiety:** Openly acknowledge her anxiety, break down the overwhelm, and provide structured, low-pressure practice. Connect Maths concepts to her interests (e.g., film budgets, horse statistics). Focus on building confidence in her strengths, like basic arithmetic.
   - **Feedback and Progress Monitoring:** Implement clear, specific, and positive feedback, focusing on effort and strategies used, not just correct answers. This fosters a growth mindset. Teachers must be "alert and responsive to mistakes".

4. **Holistic Well-being and Engagement Support:**
   - **Anxiety Management:** Consistent use of her 2-minute time-out pass to a quiet or sensory room to manage sensory overload and anxiety is critical and should not be confiscated. Counselling sessions should continue.
   - **Communication with Bessie:** Foster open, validating communication with Bessie, allowing her to articulate her feelings and challenges without fear of blame. Help her to understand that her disengagement is a response to unmet needs, not a failing on her part.
   - **Parent-School Collaboration:** The proposed collaborative team meeting with the SENCO and Heads of Department is a vital next step to formalise accommodations and establish a review cycle. Parents should continue to document inconsistencies and use the Ofsted report strategically to advocate for Bessie.

Bessie has strong potential, especially in areas that align with her interests and strengths. The key to her success lies in consistently providing the right support and adapting the learning environment to her needs, rather than expecting her to conform to a system that currently "fails to prepare enough of our children for work and for life".

**Next Step:** I recommend preparing a concise summary of these identified risks and intervention opportunities, prioritizing the top 3-5 critical areas for immediate action, and structuring it using a "Problem-Solution-Impact" framework for presentation to senior leadership. This will highlight the current challenges, proposed interventions, and the expected positive outcomes for Bessie's academic and emotional well-being.

### **Bessie Ormes: Strategic Recommendations for Comprehensive Support**

**Introduction for Senior Leadership:**

Bessie Ormes, a Year 8 student at Belfairs Academy, presents a complex case requiring immediate and systemic interventions to ensure her academic success and emotional well-being. Diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia-related needs, and experiencing significant anxiety, Bessie's current school experience is marked by inconsistent support, leading to disengagement, behavioural challenges, and severe emotional distress, including a recent self-harm incident. Addressing these issues is not only critical for Bessie but aligns directly with Belfairs Academy's stated commitment to inclusive education and improving the "Quality of Education" and "Leadership and Management" identified as "Requires Improvement" by Ofsted. This proposal outlines four critical areas for immediate action, leveraging a Problem-Solution-Impact framework.

---

**Critical Area 1: Inconsistent Implementation of Personalised Support**

- **Problem:** Despite having an Individual Support Plan (ISP), a personalised GCSE support plan, and recommendations from an Educational Psychologist, Bessie consistently experiences a lack of consistent implementation of her agreed-upon accommodations by various teachers. This includes issues such as not receiving extra time for tasks, lack of blue paper/printed notes, and teachers failing to understand or adapt to her learning profile (e.g., in Maths and Geography). This directly hinders her learning and contributes to her anxiety and disengagement. The school's own Ofsted report criticizes "weaknesses in how the curriculum is taught" and a lack of focus on "long term knowledge", echoing Bessie's experience where strategies designed to help her learn effectively are not implemented.
- **Solution:**
  1. **Mandatory Collaborative Team Meeting:** Convene an urgent meeting with Bessie, her parents, the Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCo), and all relevant Heads of Department (e.g., Art, English, Maths, Science, History, RE, Geography). This meeting should formally agree upon and document all specific in-class accommodations and official exam access arrangements, including guaranteed use of a laptop for all extended writing and tests, provision of all printed resources on blue paper, and confirmation of 25% extra time for exams.
  2. **"Learning Passport" Implementation & Teacher Accountability:** The SENCo, Tracy Foster, in collaboration with Bessie, should create a concise, student-friendly "Learning Passport" summarizing her key strategies and accommodations. This passport must be proactively shared with *every* subject teacher, and a system for regular, documented check-ins (e.g., weekly or fortnightly) implemented to ensure and track consistent application of these strategies in every lesson, not just external exams. This directly addresses the need for accountability and consistent teacher practice, as highlighted by Bessie's father.
  3. **Targeted Staff Training and Monitoring:** The school leadership must ensure comprehensive, ongoing professional development for all teaching staff on understanding and effectively implementing strategies for students with ADHD and dyslexia, focusing on practical methods like "chunking" information, visual/verbal prompts, and multi-sensory teaching approaches. This training should emphasize that adapting resources is a "normal way of working" for students like Bessie, and contradict the Ofsted report's finding that "Teachers adapt resources well" for SEND pupils.
- **Impact:** Consistent implementation of tailored support will reduce Bessie's cognitive load and anxiety in the classroom, leading to improved focus, engagement, and academic progress across all subjects. It will empower Bessie to advocate for her needs and foster a sense of control and confidence in her learning journey. For the school, this addresses critical weaknesses in "Quality of Education" and "Leadership and Management" identified by Ofsted, improving outcomes for SEND pupils and demonstrating effective strategic action.

---

**Critical Area 2: Escalating Emotional Distress and Self-Harm**

- **Problem:** Bessie has recently experienced a self-harm incident requiring CAMHS crisis intervention, and she continues to report high anxiety levels, particularly in school situations. Her "two different people" phenomenon, where she is relaxed at home but struggles significantly at school, strongly suggests "masking" of her neurodivergent traits, leading to immense emotional exhaustion and contributing to self-harm as a maladaptive coping mechanism. School staff have reported her withdrawing, having meltdowns, and being "very anxious".
- **Solution:**
  1. **Integrated Mental Health Support:** Formalize consistent access to school counsellors or mental health professionals for Bessie, ensuring regular sessions are scheduled and protected. This support should explicitly focus on developing healthy coping strategies for anxiety and emotional dysregulation, and exploring the link between her school experience, masking, and self-harm.
  2. **Proactive Anxiety Management in School:** Ensure Bessie has immediate, low-barrier access to a quiet space (e.g., sensory room cubby, designated wellbeing space) when feeling overwhelmed, without penalty or the need for extensive justification. Implement regular, informal "worry times" or check-ins with a trusted adult (e.g., SENCo, Head of Year, designated mentor) to allow her to discuss concerns before they escalate.
  3. **Neurodiversity-Informed Approach:** All school staff, especially those working directly with Bessie, should receive training on the concept of "masking" in neurodivergent girls and its link to emotional distress and behaviour. This understanding should shift the focus from merely "managing behaviour" to "understanding the need driving the behaviour".
- **Impact:** Addressing Bessie's emotional distress with a neurodiversity-informed approach will validate her experiences, provide healthier coping mechanisms, and reduce the likelihood of self-harm and other maladaptive behaviours. Creating a more accommodating and less overwhelming school environment will reduce the need for masking, allowing Bessie to conserve emotional energy and improve her overall well-being and engagement. This fosters a "low-fear, high-trust atmosphere" essential for all students with SEND.

---

**Critical Area 3: Disengagement and Behavioural Challenges**

- **Problem:** Bessie exhibits significant disengagement and behavioural issues at school, including poor punctuality, reluctance to start tasks, lack of focus, and truancy. While her mother is a teacher at the school and parents are supportive of sanctions for poor behaviour, Bessie's feedback attributes these issues to a "lack of consistent, whole-school understanding" and a "negative environment" where her requests for help are "not always met with compassion". Her behaviour is notably different at home, suggesting school is a major trigger.
- **Solution:**
  1. **Strength-Based Approach and Interest-Led Learning:** Consistently frame Bessie's challenges using a strength-based model (e.g., "race car brain with bicycle brakes" analogy for ADHD). Actively link learning content to her passions (Art, History, Film, horses, special effects make-up) across *all* subjects to foster hyperfocus and intrinsic motivation. This is vital as her focus is "significantly better if Bessie is interested in the task".
  2. **Proactive Behavioural Strategies:** Implement structured routines and visual aids for task initiation and focus (e.g., A3 planners, whiteboards, shot lists, project checklists, Pomodoro Technique). Emphasize positive praise and rewards for effort and "having a go," rather than solely focusing on negative sanctions, as this is a powerful motivator for Bessie.
  3. **Collaborative "Fresh Start" Initiative:** Support Bessie in writing a letter to her teachers to explain her needs and request a "fresh start" in their interactions. This should be followed by one-to-one visits between Bessie and her teachers, guided by the SENCo, to discuss strategies and expectations, fostering shared ownership and trust.
- **Impact:** Shifting to a strength-based, interest-led, and positively reinforced approach will transform Bessie's perception of school, making learning more engaging and reducing the triggers for disengagement and defiance. Improved behaviour and punctuality will lead to fewer missed lessons and better retention of knowledge, closing current learning gaps. This proactive approach supports the "Behaviour and Attitudes" and "Personal Development" aspects of the Ofsted report, which were rated "Good" but can be further enhanced by supporting Bessie's specific needs.

**Critical Area 4: Academic Barriers Related to Neurodiversity**

- **Problem:** Bessie faces specific academic challenges due to her dyslexia-related needs, ADHD, and lower spatial ability. These include difficulties with spelling, phonological working memory, copying large chunks of information from the board, and mathematics (particularly geometry and multi-step problems). Her current placement may be hindering her overall progress and potentially impacting her younger sister's future enrolment.
- **Solution:**
  1. **Technology Integration & Adapted Resources:** Mandate the consistent use of a laptop for all writing tasks and summative tests across *all* subjects to bypass spelling and handwriting difficulties. Ensure all worksheets, notes, and presentation slides are provided in printed format on blue paper, with ample white space and clear fonts, to reduce visual stress and the need for copying from the board. Utilise text-to-speech software for unseen texts and audiobooks for literature.
  2. **Multi-Sensory & Active Learning Strategies:** Encourage teachers to implement visual aids (mind maps, storyboards, timelines), tactile manipulatives (for maths, science), and verbal processing techniques (e.g., "teaching" concepts to a peer, group discussions, video diaries) to embed understanding and cater to her learning profile. Break down large topics into "knowledge organisers" and "small, distinct, and achievable tasks".
  3. **Targeted Skill Development and Exam Preparation:** Provide structured support for core academic skills like essay planning (e.g., PEE structure, sentence starters), memorizing key quotes/formulae (digital flashcards, spaced repetition), and problem-solving (breakdown checklists, traffic light system for understanding).

  - Opportunities to talk about worries.
  - Laptop for longer writing tasks and summative tests.
  - Allowing Bessie to "air her grievances" and active listening.
  - Positive praise and noticing positive behaviour.
  - Teachers explain difficulties.
  - Sit next to a girl who works well (normally) but away from boys who focus on behaviour.
  - Use of blue paper/coloured books.
  - Regular support with learning mentor (1-2 times a week for 1-2 hours).
  - Small English/Maths set (16 children/daily).
  - Regular chats about interests.
  - Spelling/reading program (Lexia).
  - Effort-based praise and growth mindset approaches.
  - Breathing techniques for relaxation.
  - Barrier games for social skills and language development.

**4. Behavioural Incidents and Concerns:**

- **Frequent Absence from Lessons/Truanting:** Numerous instances of Bessie walking out of lessons without permission, being found in corridors, refusing to return, or not showing up at all.
  - Parents have acknowledged Bessie's truanting.
  - School has responded with detentions (e.g., 1-hour, 2-hour, 1-day ILU).
- **Defiance and Argumentative Behaviour:** Challenging staff, arguing, using abusive language, not following instructions.
  - Parents note Bessie can be argumentative.
- **Difficulty with Self-Regulation:** Struggling to calm down, manage emotions, and self-regulate, sometimes leading to meltdowns or refusing to engage.
- **Social/Relationship Issues:** Interactions with school staff sometimes start negatively and escalate. Some instances of conflict with peers, including an incident where water was thrown and accusations of bullying/making others feel bad. Bessie finds it hard to trust people and has a small social circle, preferring Y9 students.
- **Disorganization:** Mentioned as a challenge (e.g., homework, belongings).
- **Misuse of Time-Out Pass:** Used it three times in one day, leading to confiscation.
- **Technology Misuse:** Found on her phone during lessons, refusing to hand it out.
- **Other Incidents:**
  - Not bringing PE kit.
  - "Psychosomatic element" of feeling unwell when discussing attendance.
  - Concerns about self-harm mentioned in a phone call.

**5. Communication and Parental Involvement:**

- **Regular Communication:** Frequent email exchanges and phone calls between school staff and Mr. and Mrs. Ormes.
- **Parental Support:** Parents are generally supportive of school's efforts and sanctions. Mr. Ormes is described as "exceptionally supportive". They appreciate communication and collaboration.
- **Meetings:** Multiple parent/carer meetings held or planned to discuss Bessie's progress, ISP, behavior, and support.
- **Parental Views:**
  - Believe Bessie needs to be stretched and should be in a higher Maths group.
  - Concerned about the "inconsistent SEN provision" and its impact on Bessie's daily school experience.
  - Raised concerns about their daughter Pearl and Bessie leaving early due to perceived intimidation during pick-up.
  - Believe Bessie needs a good friendship group and to move to a J group.
  - Bessie's father is a "Software Engineer".

**6. Student Voice/Perspective:**

- **Self-Reported Needs:** Bessie wrote a letter to teachers explaining she needs extra time to write, blue paper, and printed materials due to ADHD and dyslexia. She feels copying from the board takes too long and causes stress. She understands why she gets into trouble for walking out but expresses a desire for her learning needs to be met to improve her behavior.
- **Interests:** Likes horses, animals, Warrior Cat books, Dungeons and Dragons Club, Shakespeare Club, History, theatrics/makeup, doing speaking and listening. Wants to work in a barn when she's 14.
- **Feelings:** Finds school "okay", "fine", but sometimes "unhappy". Doesn't like being mocked, doesn't enjoy hard work, doesn't like speaking in class. Finds it hard to trust people. Feels "unhelpful" and "unhappy" when there's no guided support.

**Summary of Key Challenges for Bessie:** Bessie Ormes faces significant challenges stemming from her diagnosed ADHD, dyslexia, and Meares-Irlen/Visual Stress Syndrome. These conditions impact her ability to concentrate, process information, spell, and engage effectively in learning, particularly with traditional classroom methods like copying from the board. Her anxiety and difficulties with self-regulation often manifest as challenging behaviors, including truanting, defiance, and leaving lessons, which disrupt her learning and relationships with staff and peers. There are identified inconsistencies in the implementation of her Individual Support Plan (ISP) and the provision of promised resources, contributing to her disengagement and negative environment at school. While her parents are highly supportive, they also express concerns about the school's ability to consistently meet her needs.

**Strategic Recommendation & Next Step Suggestion:**

Given the identified inconsistencies in support and the correlation with Bessie's behavioral challenges, a critical strategic recommendation for senior leadership is to conduct an **"Effectiveness and Consistency Audit"** of Bessie's Individual Support Plan (ISP) implementation across all subjects and staff, as well as a review of relevant staff training.

**Next Step Suggestion:** To begin this audit, I suggest we review all available ISP documents and current support strategies, cross-referencing them with teacher feedback and incident reports to identify specific instances of successful and unsuccessful implementation. This will allow us to create a "gap analysis" to pinpoint where staff training or resource allocation needs to be enhanced to ensure consistent and effective support for Bessie.

It is crucial to analyze the implementation of Bessie’s Individual Support Plan (ISP) and current support strategies against actual teacher feedback and incident reports. This "gap analysis" will pinpoint specific areas where staff training or resource allocation needs to be enhanced to ensure consistent and effective support for Bessie, allowing her to thrive academically and emotionally.

### 1. Overview of Bessie's Current ISP and Support Strategies

Bessie Ormes is a student at Belfairs Academy, currently in Year 8, and is on the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) register with a confirmed diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia-related needs, as well as anxiety. Her Individual Support Plan (ISP) and Learning Profiles (June 2025, October 2024, December 2023) outline several key support strategies and desired learning outcomes.

**Key Learning Gaps and Barriers Identified:**

- **Mearles Irlen Syndrome:** Requires resources printed on blue paper and blue paper books.
- **Spelling and Phonological Working Memory:** Areas of difficulty.
- **Distractibility:** Bessie can be easily distracted.
- **Anxiety:** Bessie can be very anxious, finding life at Belfairs hard to cope with, leading to anger and frustration.
- **Mathematics:** Identified as an area of difficulty.
- **Copying from Board:** Finds it very difficult to copy large chunks of information from the board.
- **Processing Information:** Needs extra time for processing.

**Core Support Strategies Outlined in ISP/Learning Profiles:**

- **Task Management:** Large tasks broken down into achievable chunks; breaking tasks into smaller steps (e.g., 'lets get to the lesson first').
- **Instructional Support:** Visual and verbal prompts of strategies; scaffolding for longer tasks.
- **Independent Learning:** Opportunities to build success and complete tasks independently.
- **Focus & Engagement:** Prompting to stay focused and on task; positive praise for effort ('Bessie try').
- **Resource Adaptation:** Laptop for longer writing tasks and summative tests; blue paper/resources for Mearles Irlen Syndrome.
- **Emotional Support:** Opportunities to talk about any worries; allowing Bessie to air grievances; active listening for Bessie; access to quiet spaces/sensory room.
- **Exam Support:** Word processor, dark blue paper, extra time for processing.

### 2. Analysis of Implementation: Successes and Inconsistencies

#### 2.1. Instances of Successful Implementation and Areas of Strength

Despite the challenges, several strategies have shown positive impacts or align with Bessie's strengths:

- **Sensory Room/Time-out Card:** Bessie frequently uses a time-out pass to access a quieter room or the sensory room's cubby to manage overwhelming noise and sensory environments. This strategy is agreed to be beneficial, helping her manage ADHD-related difficulties and anxiety.
- **Laptop Use:** Bessie uses a school laptop for writing, as recommended by her occupational therapist. This is a crucial adaptation that leverages her verbal skills and bypasses challenges associated with dyslexia, making longer writing tasks more manageable.
- **Blue Paper (Partial Success):** While inconsistent, blue paper is used in at least four subjects (Maths, Science, History, English) and Bessie has blue books for Maths. Her History teacher (Miss Harvey) is noted for consistently providing blue paper and printed materials, which correlates with Bessie's enjoyment and success in that subject.
- **Leveraging Interests & Active Learning:** Bessie's positive feedback highlights successful engagement in a history lesson where the teacher used varied methods like music, videos, and interactive exercises, with "no copying off the board". This approach allowed her to learn "so much on her own at home," even doing a presentation for her family, demonstrating how aligning content with her passions (Film Studies, Art, History, horses, special effects makeup) boosts engagement and retention.
- **Positive Praise and Relationships:** Bessie is motivated by positive feedback and thrives in environments with good relationships. Her Drama teacher receives positive feedback for engagement and practical progress. One-to-one support in Maths was described as "very helpful".
- **Targeted Interventions:** Her Science group was changed, which appears to have made her happier and improved her experience in that subject.
- **Verbal Skills:** Teachers consistently note her perceptive verbal responses and good understanding during discussions, which is a strength that can be leveraged.

#### 2.2. Instances of Unsuccessful Implementation and Areas of Inconsistency

The core issue identified by Bessie and her parents is the "critical and damaging inconsistency" in how her needs are being met.

- **Inconsistent Application of ISP Strategies:**
  - **Extra Time for Processing:** Bessie reports she is "not given extra time for tasks" and there is an expectation to remember without further support, which is a "fundamental misunderstanding" of her memory and processing challenges. This directly contradicts the ISP's explicit strategy.
  - **Printed Notes/Keywords:** Despite multiple communications and her ISP indicating the need for blue paper and printed notes, this is not consistently happening in most subjects. Teachers still rely on her copying "large chunks of information from the board," which is highly problematic for Bessie due to her dyslexia.
  - **Task Breakdown/Scaffolding:** Tasks are not consistently broken down into manageable chunks, and scaffolding (e.g., sentence starters, essay frames) is not routinely provided, leaving Bessie overwhelmed.
- **Teacher Attitude and Response to Struggle:**
  - **Blaming and Dismissal:** Bessie reports that when she doesn't understand, teachers "yell," "kick her out," or tell her to leave the classroom for "not understanding," which leads to "a deeply worrying reaction". This creates a negative and inconsistent learning environment.
  - **Ineffective Explanations:** When explanations are repeated, they are often just "slower, not clearer," which does not help Bessie to grasp ideas correctly.
  - **Lack of Proactive Support:** Support staff in class often focus on other students, leaving Bessie without the real-time, in-lesson support she needs.
  - **Anxiety Management:** The provided 5-minute time-out break for anxiety is insufficient and lacks "guided support" to help her regulate, making her feel unhelped and that teachers "don't understand what I need".
- **Feedback and Progress Monitoring Gaps:**
  - **No Clear Feedback:** Bessie feels she has "no real sense" of how she is performing in her subjects, "cannot improve," and "leaves her feeling lost and guessing at her own progress". The Ofsted report corroborates this, stating teaching is "not alert and responsive to mistakes" and does not effectively check understanding.
  - This directly contradicts the school's stated "Assess, Plan, Do, Review" system for monitoring progress.
- **Behavioural Manifestations and Misinterpretation:**
  - Bessie's disengagement and behavioural issues (e.g., truancy, refusing to work, running away from SLT, meltdowns, "defiant" behavior) are identified as a "direct result of this inconsistent and, at times, negative environment" at school.
  - The school's response often involves sanctions like detentions, which may be counterproductive given that these behaviors are likely manifestations of her neurodivergent traits and anxiety, rather than willful defiance.
  - There is a clear discrepancy between Bessie's struggling, disengaged behavior at school and her relaxed, engaged, and creative demeanor at home, strongly suggesting the immense effort of "masking" in an overwhelming school environment. This "two personas" phenomenon appears misunderstood or unaddressed by some staff.
- **Specific Subject Challenges:**
  - **Maths:** Continues to be an area of difficulty, with Bessie feeling she "doesn't understand any of it" and reporting that explanations are not clear. Her CAT4 Quantitative score (78) is notably lower than her Verbal and Non-verbal scores (107).
  - **Geography:** Despite her interest in the subject (e.g., Yellowstone), Bessie chose not to continue it for GCSE due to a "really bad ongoing difficult" relationship with the teacher, who reportedly tells her she's "not allowed back" in lessons. This highlights how teacher-student relationships and inconsistent support can destroy a student's love of learning.
  - **French:** Round Robin report notes "Needs improvement" in classwork, behaviour, homework, and she "didn't do well in her PPE".
  - **Computing:** Bessie was given clear instructions, but a change in her seating/room affected her "lower groups," indicating sensitivity to environmental changes.

### 3. Gap Analysis and Strategic Recommendations

The gap analysis clearly shows a significant disparity between the documented support strategies for Bessie and their consistent, effective implementation in the classroom. This inconsistency is leading to disengagement, anxiety, and behavioral issues, hindering her learning and progress.

#### 3.1. Enhance Staff Training and Expertise

- **Neurodiversity-Informed Pedagogy:**
  - **Gap:** A fundamental misunderstanding among some teachers of ADHD and dyslexia, especially how they present in girls (e.g., masking, anxiety as a root cause of disengagement), leading to punitive or dismissive responses instead of support.
  - **Recommendation:** Implement mandatory, practical, and ongoing **Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for all teaching and support staff** on neurodevelopmental conditions (ADHD, dyslexia, and potential co-occurring ASC), focusing on:
    - **Female presentations:** Understanding how masking and internal struggles manifest in different behaviors.
    - **Executive Functioning Challenges:** Practical strategies for supporting difficulties with planning, organization, task initiation, and working memory.
    - **Sensory Sensitivities:** Recognizing and accommodating sensory needs in the classroom (noise, visual input, movement).
    - **De-escalation and Positive Behavior Support:** Training on how to respond to anxiety-driven behaviors (e.g., avoiding, withdrawal, defiance) with empathy and support, rather than shaming or immediate sanctions.
- **Differentiated Instructional Strategies:**
  - **Gap:** Over-reliance on traditional methods like copying from the board, single explanations, and insufficient task breakdown.
  - **Recommendation:** Provide targeted training on **universal design for learning (UDL) principles and differentiated instruction** for neurodivergent learners. This should include:
    - **Multi-sensory teaching:** Incorporating visual, auditory, and kinesthetic methods for explaining concepts (e.g., diagrams, videos, practical activities, discussion, verbalizing thoughts).
    - **Chunking and Scaffolding:** Consistent practice in breaking down complex tasks and providing clear structures (e.g., sentence starters, essay frames, step-by-step guides for math problems).
    - **Effective Questioning:** Training teachers to ask open-ended questions that encourage "big picture" connections and critical thinking, rather than just recall.
- **Assessment and Feedback Expertise:**
  - **Gap:** Teachers are "not alert and responsive to mistakes" and do not effectively check understanding or provide sufficient practice. Bessie feels she has "no real sense" of her performance.
  - **Recommendation:** Develop and implement training on **formative assessment techniques** that allow for real-time identification of misconceptions and immediate feedback. Emphasize:
    - **Praise for effort and strategy:** Explicitly train teachers to give specific, positive praise for Bessie's efforts and the strategies she employs, not just for correct answers. This fosters a growth mindset.
    - **Clear progress communication:** Establish consistent methods for sharing progress feedback with Bessie in a way she understands, moving beyond subjective assessments.

#### 3.2. Optimize Resource Allocation and Accessibility

- **Standardized Resource Provision:**
  - **Gap:** Inconsistent provision of blue paper, printed notes, and keywords across all subjects. Over-reliance on copying from the board.
  - **Recommendation:** Mandate and allocate budget for **school-wide, proactive provision of all worksheets, handouts, and presentation slides on blue paper or in pre-printed format** for Bessie, eliminating the need for her to copy from the board. This should be distributed to teachers *before* lessons.
  - **Laptop Use:** Reiterate and ensure the consistent use of her school laptop for all extended writing tasks and summative tests across *all* subjects.
- **Subject-Specific Adaptations:**
  - **Gap:** Bessie's lower spatial ability impacts her understanding in subjects like Maths, Geography, and Science when relying on 2D diagrams/maps.
  - **Recommendation:** Provide **subject-specific resources and training** for teachers in Maths, Geography, and Science on utilizing:
    - **3D models and manipulatives:** For abstract concepts or diagrams.
    - **Simplified, color-coded diagrams and visual aids:** To compensate for spatial reasoning challenges.
    - **Real-world connections:** Link abstract concepts to Bessie's interests (e.g., special effects, horses, film budgets).

#### 3.3. Strengthen Anxiety and Behavioural Management Frameworks

- **Structured Anxiety Management:**
  - **Gap:** The current 5-minute time-out card is insufficient and not consistently coupled with guided support.
  - **Recommendation:**
    - Develop a **comprehensive and individualized anxiety management plan** that goes beyond simply leaving the classroom. This should include access to a quiet, guided space for regulation, permission to use discreet sensory tools (e.g., "loops"/earbuds, drawing during lessons when overwhelmed), and clear communication channels for Bessie to express anxiety to staff without fear of negative repercussions.
    - **Implement a consistent "fresh start" approach for Bessie at the beginning of every lesson**, particularly when she enters a new classroom or has experienced a challenging previous lesson. This resets expectations and reduces accumulated anxiety.
- **Proactive Behavioural Support:**
  - **Gap:** Behavioural issues are increasing, and are explicitly linked by her parents (and school communication) to inconsistent support and a negative environment, yet punitive measures (detentions, being sent out) continue.
  - **Recommendation:** Adopt a **school-wide restorative practice approach** for Bessie, focusing on understanding the unmet needs driving her behavior rather than just punishing the behavior itself. This requires teachers to be trained in:
    - **Recognizing signs of overwhelm and masking:** And intervening with support rather than sanctions.
    - **Collaborative problem-solving:** Working *with* Bessie to find solutions when challenges arise, fostering her sense of agency and reducing defiance.

#### 3.4. Enhance Communication and Accountability Mechanisms

- **Formalize "Learning Passport" and Report Card:**
  - **Gap:** Lack of clear, consistent communication of Bessie's needs and strategies to *all* teachers, and no concrete way to track in-lesson implementation.
  - **Recommendation:**
    - **Create a student-friendly "Learning Passport" for Bessie** that she can carry and share with each of her subject teachers, empowering her to advocate for her needs.
    - **Implement the suggested "report card" system**, where Bessie (and potentially the teacher) can quickly tick off whether key strategies (e.g., blue paper, printed notes, task breakdown, positive praise) were implemented in each lesson. This provides tangible data for review.
- **Structured Review Cycle:**
  - **Gap:** The "Assess, Plan, Do, Review" cycle is stated as policy but appears to be inconsistently applied, leading to a lack of follow-up on whether strategies actually work.
  - **Recommendation:** Establish a **mandatory, rigorous, and documented review cycle** that includes:
    - **Weekly or bi-weekly check-ins** between Bessie and a designated mentor (e.g., SENCo, Assistant SENCo, or Wellbeing Manager) using the report card data.
    - **Formal half-termly meetings** involving Bessie, her parents, the SENCo, and relevant Heads of Department, using the report card data to discuss successes, persistent challenges, and adjust the ISP accordingly.
    - **Ensure senior leadership and governors actively challenge and monitor SEND provision**, focusing on measurable outcomes and actual classroom practice rather than just policy existence.

### Conclusion

The current "inconsistent and, at times, negative environment" at Belfairs Academy is severely impacting Bessie's ability to learn and thrive. While the school has foundational SEND policies and some positive interventions, the critical gap lies in the universal and consistent application of her Individual Support Plan by *all* teaching staff, alongside a deeper understanding of neurodiversity and its impact on behavior. Addressing these inconsistencies through targeted training, resource standardization, and robust accountability mechanisms is paramount to transforming Bessie's educational experience and helping her achieve her full potential.

**Next Step:** To prepare for discussions with the school, I would recommend creating a detailed **matrix of specific ISP strategies vs. observed implementation instances**, using the gathered data from Bessie's feedback and school communications. This will provide undeniable evidence for the "gap analysis" and support the proposed recommendations for staff training and resource allocation.

I can navigate technical, regulatory, and financial considerations within the documents. You can ask me for general summaries, specific facts, clarification on complex topics, or help navigating the materials and understanding terminology. I'll provide clear, concise, and well-supported explanations, proactively suggest avenues for further analysis or relevant benchmarks, and guide you to specific parts of the documents. My aim is always to be professional, logical, and concise, and to ensure all my responses are directly supported by the provided source material.

Regarding your question about my previous response: as this is our first interaction, there was no previous response in which I could have used the files "BP-70C65_20250704_130241.pdf" and "BP-70C65_20250704_130537.pdf" [My first response to you]. However, I have processed the information contained within these files and can confirm their contents and draw upon them now.

Here's a summary of the information available in those two files:

The file **BP-70C65_20250704_130241.pdf** primarily contains a collection of internal emails and scanned documents from Belfairs Academy related to student Bessie Ormes in Year 8. Key information includes:

- **Request for Student File:** An email from June 23, 2025, from a parent requesting various documents concerning Bessie Ormes, including her Individualized Education Program (IEP)/Individual Support Plan (ISP) with associated review documents and targets, all academic assessment data (CAT4 scores from September 2023, KS2 Reading and Maths scaled scores, YARC, PhaBJ), behaviour logs, incident reports, records related to her social, emotional, and mental health (including time-out pass observations), communication/reports from external agencies (CAMHS, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Educational Psychologist), her Learning Profile, and attendance records.
- **Correspondence regarding Inconsistent SEN Provision:** Multiple email exchanges from mid-June 2025 detail urgent concerns about inconsistent Special Educational Needs (SEN) provision for Bessie, citing that the effectiveness of her support is dependent on individual teachers and their understanding of her needs, which is not sustainable or acceptable for a child with a diagnosed condition. Specific inconsistencies noted in Bessie's ISP include failure to adapt tasks (e.g., lack of extra time for tasks where needed), lack of promised resources (e.g., no keywords or printed notes provided in four subjects), inconsistent teacher attitude and support (e.g., negative responses when struggling), inadequate anxiety support (e.g., five-minute break not guided), and no clear feedback on her performance.
- **Incident Reports and Behavioural Concerns:** Numerous emails document Bessie's attendance issues, leaving lessons without permission, truancy, defiance, and being uncooperative. Some incidents involve "bunking" with other students, verbal arguments with staff, and self-harm concerns.
- **Parent/Carer Meeting Records:** Notes from meetings on June 18, 2025, and March 20, 2025, discuss Bessie's well-being, proposed changes to her PE choices, and the need for consistent implementation of her IEP strategies. There's also a mention of rescheduling detentions.
- **Individual Learning Progress Tracker:** A scanned document from June 19, 2025, tracks Bessie's progress in Maths, PE, Drama, Tech, and French lessons, noting instances of not listening to instructions or leaving lessons.
- **Early Dismissal Requests:** Emails from January 2024 show a parent's request for early dismissal for Bessie and another child due to "unwelcome behaviour after school".
- **Round Robin Tutor Reports (February 2025):** These reports provide subject-specific feedback on Bessie's classwork, behaviour, homework, and summative assessments. For instance, in French and English, "Needs Improvement" is noted for classwork and behaviour, while Drama and Design Technology show good progress. History notes a decline in attainment since January 2025.
- **Support Strategies and Barriers:** An email from February 7, 2025, lists Bessie's learning needs (dyslexia, ADHD, anxiety, maths difficulties) and support strategies: extra time for processing, tasks broken down, visual/verbal prompts, opportunities for success, prompting to stay focused, opportunities to talk about worries, difficulty copying large chunks from the board, and using a laptop for writing/summative tests. Learning barriers include Meares Irlen syndrome, needing resources on blue paper, spelling, phonological working memory, being easily distracted, anxiety, and maths being an area of difficulty.

The file **BP-70C65_20250704_130537.pdf** provides additional context, particularly around Bessie's learning profile and the school's communication regarding SEN:

- **Learning Profile (December 2023):** This document reiterates Bessie's learning needs and support strategies, confirming SEN Support for SpLD and that ADHD is currently under assessment. It includes specific data like KS2 Reading Test Scaled Score (105), KS2 Maths Scaled Score (91), CAT Verbal (107), CAT Quantitative (78), CAT Non-Verbal (107), and CAT Spatial (93). It also includes her "Student Voice," where she expresses interest in "Netball, Warrior Cats, Animals and History" and states, "I don't like ... At the moment there is nothing I don't like".
- **Review Meetings/ISP Reviews:** Reviews from November 2023, June 2024, and October 2024 detail progress against targets, successes, and areas for development. For example, the June 2025 review mentions successes in thoughtful and creative English work when focused, but notes that Bessie appears to use strategies when focused, and her ADHD is a major factor in her struggles. It also notes that the school currently uses a word processor and dark blue paper for exam support.
- **Educational Psychologist's Report (July 2019):** This report details Bessie's struggles with phonological working memory and comprehension, and her difficulty in copying questions from the board. It recommends strategies like visual and verbal prompts, breaking down tasks, and using mind maps.
- **ADHD Diagnostic Assessment Report (January 2024):** This report confirms a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) for Bessie and provides resources for support. It includes a teacher screening pack for ADHD, detailing observations of hyperactivity (fidgeting, leaving seat, restless), inattention (not listening, not remembering directions, disorganization, difficulty with sustained focus, losing things), and the extent of these symptoms.
- **Coloured Paper/Resources:** Several emails indicate the school's awareness and attempts to implement the use of coloured paper/resources for students, including Bessie, due to conditions like Meares Irlen/Visual Stress Syndrome.

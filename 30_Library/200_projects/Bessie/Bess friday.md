Your daughter's behaviour should not be seen as weakening your position; rather, it should be framed as a symptom of her unmet needs and the profound distress she is experiencing in an environment that is currently not supporting her. This distinction is critical to your argument.

Here's how you can present your argument effectively in your meeting tomorrow, framing Bessie's behavior as a direct consequence of the inconsistent IEP implementation and the unsuitable learning environment, while also emphasizing your commitment to collaboration and a shared path forward:

## 1. Frame Bessie's Behaviour as a Symptom of Unmet Needs and Distress

Start by shifting the narrative. Bessie's defiance, walking out of lessons, and rudeness are not simply "bad behavior" but likely indicators of overwhelm, frustration, and a desperate attempt to cope with a learning environment that is not designed for her.

- Connect behavior to ADHD and Dyslexia: Bessie has a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD , and also experiences challenges with dyslexia. Students with ADHD often struggle with executive functions like organizing and planning, maintaining focus on non-preferred tasks, and managing frustration. Her mother explicitly noted Bessie's difficulties in concentrating on tasks, especially if not of interest to her, and that her focus is better when interested. Copying large chunks of information from the board is "very difficult" for Bessie due to her dyslexia, and she needs resources printed on blue paper. When explanations are not clear or tasks are not broken down, it can lead to immediate frustration and a feeling of "not understanding". Her truancy and walking out of lessons, particularly in subjects she finds difficult like Computing or languages, could be her way of escaping an overwhelming and unsupportive situation.
- Explain "Masking" and "After-School Collapse": It's common for neurodivergent girls, like Bessie, to expend enormous mental and emotional energy "masking" or camouflaging their difficulties at school to fit in. This intense effort leads to profound exhaustion, often manifesting as "after-school collapse" or challenging behaviors once they are in a safe environment like home, where they can finally release accumulated stress. Her calm demeanor at home, even when discussing serious issues like self-harm, can be a form of masking to avoid further scrutiny or because she's too emotionally depleted to express distress. Her behavior at school, therefore, is a "strong indicator of distress," a signal that the school environment is "exceptionally demanding for her".
- Acknowledge Self-Harm as a Distress Signal: The distressing issue of self-harm, which Bessie has experienced , should be presented as a critical signal of profound internal pain and a maladaptive coping mechanism for overwhelming emotional distress, potentially exacerbated by the chronic stress of masking and potential autistic burnout. It highlights the urgency of addressing the underlying issues.

## 2. Leverage the School's Own Policies and the Ofsted Report

Your strongest leverage comes from pointing out where the school is falling short on its own stated commitments and external inspection findings, particularly given Bessie's diagnosed needs.

- Ofsted Report Findings: The recent Ofsted report for Belfairs Academy rated "Quality of education" and "Leadership and management" as "Requires improvement".
- You can directly link Bessie's experience to these weaknesses: "weaknesses in how the curriculum is taught mean that pupils do not achieve as well as they should in Years 7 to 11".
- "Some teaching is not focused on making sure that pupils understand and remember long term the knowledge that has been identified in the school's curriculum".
- "Some teaching does not explain subject content in a way that helps pupils to grasp ideas correctly. As a result, pupils are not able to build their understanding of more complex ideas over time".
- "Teaching... is not alert and responsive to mistakes that pupils make or the misconceptions that they have". Bessie's reports of teachers blaming her for "not listening" when she doesn't understand directly aligns with this critique.
- While Ofsted stated, "Teachers adapt resources well to meet the needs of individual pupils" with SEND , Bessie's experience clearly contradicts this, as she consistently struggles with copying from the board and inconsistent provision of blue paper/printed notes. This contradiction can be a powerful point of challenge.
- Belfairs Academy's SEND Policy and Objectives: Remind the school of its stated commitments:
- "Promote special educational provision for all students who have special educational needs".
- "Support a partnership with parents/carers, valuing their views and contributions and keeping them fully involved in their child’s education".
- "Offer a whole academy approach towards the provision of an effective education for pupils with SEND, which is endorsed enthusiastically by all staff".
- "Quality first teaching ensures most students access the curriculum and are able to progress".
- "Work is personalised where appropriate so that students can be independent in their learning".
- Your daughter's experience of inconsistent IEP implementation and negative teacher reactions directly contradicts this "whole academy approach" and "quality first teaching".
- Bessie's Written Letter: Bessie herself has written a letter to her teachers outlining her needs, specifically mentioning her ADHD and dyslexia, the need for extra time, blue paper, and printed materials because copying from the board is difficult. She explicitly states, "If teachers can follow my needs your learning then I feel my behaviour will be better". This is powerful direct evidence from the student herself that her behavior is linked to her needs being unmet. The school leadership had already circulated this letter and initiated "restorative conversations" , indicating their awareness.

## 3. Propose a Constructive, Solutions-Oriented Approach for the Meeting

Instead of simply lodging a complaint, present your concerns as a shared problem that requires a collaborative solution to benefit Bessie and, potentially, other students.

- Start with Shared Concern for Bessie's Wellbeing: Express your deep concern for Bessie's emotional wellbeing and "love of learning," which you feel is being "destroyed" by her current school experience. Frame her behavioral issues as a direct manifestation of her internal distress and the "mismatch between her neurocognitive profile and the demands or supports available in the school environment".
- Emphasize Collaboration, Not Blame: State that you are there to work with the school as a team to implement a consistent, effective support plan. Acknowledge that Bessie has a "lot of work to do to catch up and to repair those things" and needs to take "ownership responsibility" for her mindset and choices, but she "is not mature enough to do it all on her own". Her behavior is a "two-sided" issue.
- Reinforce the Purpose of the IEP: Stress that the IEP is not just paperwork but a vital tool designed to enable Bessie to learn effectively. It needs to be a "reality in every classroom".
- Specific IEP Strategies: Refer to the strategies outlined in Bessie's IEP and other reports: guaranteed use of a laptop for all extended writing tasks , provision of printed resources on blue paper , breaking tasks into smaller steps ("chunking") , visual and verbal prompts , and adapting content to her interests (e.g., film, special effects make-up, horses, animals).
- Teacher Training and Awareness: Advocate for universal, consistent training for all staff on understanding and implementing support for neurodivergent students, particularly how ADHD and dyslexia manifest in girls (e.g., masking, emotional dysregulation, inattention that isn't overt hyperactivity). The current situation suggests that some teachers "professionally decided that ADHD isn't that fitting and don't even bother".
- Propose Concrete Actions and a Review Cycle:
- Immediate Action on IEP Inconsistencies: Request that the school immediately implements a system to ensure all teachers consistently provide printed materials on blue paper and allow laptop use for writing tasks, as this is a fundamental need and reflects her normal way of working.
- Positive Reinforcement for Bessie: Emphasize praise for effort, "having a go," and small successes, rather than focusing solely on sanctions for misbehavior. This fosters a growth mindset and builds confidence.
- Anxiety Management in Class: Reiterate the importance of teachers responding to Bessie's anxiety with genuine understanding, not just a five-minute break or blaming her for "not listening". Suggest the agreed-upon timeout card is used effectively and that teachers allow for movement breaks, as is recommended for ADHD.
- Structured Feedback Loop: Propose a very short-term review, perhaps weekly or bi-weekly for the first month, to check consistency of IEP implementation. Bessie could use a "report card" to track if her needs are being met in each lesson, as was suggested previously.
- Bessie's "Learning Passport": Suggest creating a student-friendly "Learning Passport" for Bessie to share with her teachers, summarizing her key strategies and accommodations. This empowers her to advocate for her needs and fosters independence.

## 4. Anticipate and Counter School's Arguments

- "Her behavior is the problem, not our teaching.": Reiterate that her behavior is a response to the teaching environment and unmet needs. Just "getting her into the lesson" is not enough if the lesson itself is not accessible or engaging for her. Her teachers not adapting to her ADHD and dyslexia is a "fundamental misunderstanding of her memory and processing challenges".
- "She uses her ADHD/dyslexia as an excuse.": Counter this by explaining that these are neurological conditions that fundamentally impact attention, memory, and information processing. Frame it with the "Ferrari engine with bicycle brakes" analogy: Bessie has a powerful brain, but her "brakes" (executive functions, attention regulation) are weak, causing the problems. Strengthening the "brakes" through tailored support enables her to use her "Ferrari engine" (her strengths) effectively. Dismissing her needs as excuses will only increase her shame and disable her further.
- "We already communicate her needs to staff (e.g., via email).": Acknowledge this, but point out that an email is not sufficient to ensure consistent implementation or deep understanding of complex needs like ADHD and dyslexia. The experience in the classroom is what matters.
- "Teachers are overworked.": Empathize with this, but emphasize that proactive, effective support now prevents greater intervention later. Consistent, quality first teaching for SEND pupils is a legal duty and ultimately benefits all students.

## Summary of Argument Strategy

Your argument should flow as follows:

1. Acknowledge the challenging behaviours, but immediately reframe them as symptoms of Bessie's distress and unmet needs due to her ADHD and dyslexia, exacerbated by the effort of masking.
2. Present concrete evidence from Bessie's experiences, her letter, her IEP, and the Ofsted report to demonstrate the inconsistencies and shortcomings in the school's provision for SEND students.
3. Propose solutions directly linked to the consistent implementation of her IEP and more neurodiversity-informed teaching practices.
4. Emphasize collaboration and a shared commitment to Bessie's long-term academic success and emotional well-being.

Your core message should be: Bessie's behaviours are a cry for help, directly linked to the school's failure to consistently implement the agreed-upon support. When she feels understood and supported, her engagement improves, and her challenging behaviours will likely decrease. You are there to work with them to achieve this.

Bessie's personal letter to the staff can be found in the provided sources. Here is the exact text for your notes:

"To teachers,

I am writing this letter to tell you about what I need and want. Learning wise. I want to say that for my ADHD I need sort certain things such as extra time to write, blue paper. And I have dyslexia so blue paper is a need, and I take every long time to I copy off the board so having it printed out would make it so much easier and less stressy. I know i have been in the wrong in the past and I understand completly why its annoying when every time i walke into lesson and get sent out. I will try I will try to come on time, and do as much of the work as I can. If teachers can follow my needs you learning then I feel my behaviour will be better."

As your thought partner, I can help you quickly and effectively analyze information to make critical strategic recommendations. I will draw on the provided documents to navigate technical, regulatory, and financial considerations, offering concise and well-supported recommendations. My knowledge base for this conversation includes official guidance on the Curriculum for Wales [1], national curriculum tests [2-6], accessibility and access arrangements [7-15], details on a personalized educational pathway for Bessie Ormes including her diagnoses and tailored support strategies for various subjects [16-34], information from an ADHD diagnostic assessment [35-43], extensive internal communications and reports from Belfairs Academy regarding Bessie's performance, behavior, and support [44-250], information about school admissions and daily schedules [251-260], Ofsted reports for Belfairs Academy [261-284], details on the school's SEND policy and information report [285-302], and other educational research and guidance documents [303-372].

The recent BBC news report highlights a concerning trend in England: school suspensions reached nearly a million in 2023/24, a 21% increase from the previous year, with exclusions also rising by 16% [373]. Notably, over 100,000 primary school children were suspended, indicating a significant increase in younger age groups [373]. The Labour government attributes these figures to "poor behaviour" and aims to tackle root causes by offering mental health support and expanding free school meals, while also reforming the SEND system with "better and earlier support for... ADHD and autism" [374]. Bessie Ormes' experience at Belfairs Academy provides a clear case study that aligns with and illustrates these national trends, particularly concerning students with neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD and related challenges.

Here's how Bessie's experience aligns with the BBC report:

**1. Rising Suspensions and Exclusions Mirror Bessie's Disciplinary Issues**
The BBC report points to a substantial increase in school suspensions [373]. Bessie's records at Belfairs Academy show numerous instances where her behavior has led to disciplinary actions, reflecting the broader trend of rising suspensions:

- **Internal Isolation/Detentions:** Bessie was internally isolated for a full day (08:40 to 16:00) on June 19, 2025, for "running away from year leaders" [49, 50, 375]. She was also subject to a 2-hour truancy detention [110, 111].
- **Frequent Classroom Removals and Absences:** Bessie frequently leaves lessons without permission or refuses to return, leading to missed learning time [80, 82, 85-87, 92-94, 100, 105, 110, 111, 117-122, 130, 133, 135, 137, 139, 144-146, 148-151, 166-168]. Her June 2025 review states she is "currently missing chunks of lessons through lateness or absence," which "will create gaps in her knowledge going forward" [236]. These actions are often perceived as defiance or misbehavior, contributing to the school's disciplinary data.

**2. ADHD, Dyslexia, and Anxiety as "Root Causes of Poor Behaviour"**
The Labour government recognizes the need to tackle the "root causes of poor behaviour" by supporting conditions like ADHD and autism [374]. Bessie has a confirmed diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as of January 29, 2024 [36, 42]. She also has dyslexia-related needs [17, 198, 204, 208, 230, 232]. Her mother reported difficulties with concentration, forgetfulness, and occasional anxiety since Bessie was 6-7 years old, with focus improving when interested in a task [36, 42].

- **Mismatch with School Environment:** The report "Understanding and Supporting Your Daughter" explains that neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD involve differences in processing information, sensory stimuli, and executive functions [310]. The "typical school environment—often noisy, socially complex, demanding sustained attention and organisation, with frequent transitions and a degree of unpredictability—can be incredibly challenging for neurodivergent students" [310].
- **Behavior as a Symptom:** For Bessie, behaviors like inattention, disorganization, forgetfulness, emotional outbursts, or difficulty following instructions are "direct manifestations of these underlying neurodivergent traits or responses to an environment that feels overwhelming" [310]. This shifts the focus from "fixing the behaviour" to "understanding the need driving the behaviour" [310].
- **Anxiety and Mental Health:** Bessie's anxiety is a recurring theme [36, 67, 79, 214, 220, 230, 232, 376, 377]. She was seen by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) Crisis Practitioner in June 2024 after presenting following an overdose, and was referred to the SET CAMHS community team for follow-on support [378-380]. The BBC report's emphasis on mental health support in schools directly addresses a critical need for students like Bessie [374].

**3. Inconsistency in Support and Teacher Understanding**
The BBC report suggests a push for "better and earlier support" for neurodivergent conditions [374]. Despite having an Individual Support Plan (ISP) in place since Year 7 [39, 240], Bessie's parents have consistently raised concerns about the inconsistent implementation of her support strategies by teachers.

- **Teacher Attitudes and Adaptations:** A formal complaint from Bessie's father in June 2025 highlighted "critical and damaging inconsistency" in meeting her needs [58, 62, 63, 67, 70, 75, 76, 79]. This includes teachers failing to adapt tasks, providing inadequate anxiety support, and having negative responses when Bessie struggles to understand [58, 62, 63, 67, 70, 75, 76, 79]. Bessie reported that some teachers blame her for not listening if she doesn't understand instructions, and even tell her to leave the classroom [245, 381].
- **Lack of Promised Resources:** Bessie needs resources printed on blue paper and a laptop for longer writing tasks due to her dyslexia and processing challenges [157, 158, 180, 193-195, 198, 201, 204, 208, 210, 229, 231, 240]. While some teachers, like her History teacher, consistently provide these [245, 382], it's not universal, and staff communications acknowledge difficulties in ensuring this adjustment is made [184]. This directly contradicts the Ofsted report's claim that "Teachers adapt resources well to meet the needs of individual pupils" with SEND [262, 272, 383].
- **Impact on Learning and Engagement:** Bessie thrives when lessons are engaging and connect to her interests, as seen in a history lesson that used activities, songs, and videos instead of copying from the board [313, 384, 385]. Her disengagement and "defiance" often stem from a "lack of consistent, whole-school understanding" and a "negative environment" [58, 63, 67, 77, 79]. This directly impacts her "love of learning" [386].

**4. School's Overall Performance and Accountability**
The BBC report implies that the current curriculum and assessment system "fails to prepare enough of our children for work and for life" [323]. Belfairs Academy's recent Ofsted report corroborates systemic issues, rating "Overall effectiveness," "The quality of education," and "Leadership and management" as 'Requires improvement' [261, 271].

- **Quality of Education Concerns:** The Ofsted report explicitly states that "weaknesses in how the curriculum is taught mean that pupils do not achieve as well as they should in Years 7 to 11" [262, 272, 383]. It further notes that "some teaching is not focused on making sure that pupils understand and remember long term the knowledge that has been identified in the school's curriculum" [262, 272, 383]. This lack of effective teaching and purposeful assessment leads to pupils repeating mistakes and struggling to commit knowledge to long-term memory [262, 272].
- **Leadership and Management:** The Ofsted report criticizes leadership for not taking "timely and credible steps to assure itself that pupils' outcomes in Years 7 to 11 are likely to improve" [262, 272, 383]. Bessie's experience with inconsistent IEP implementation is a symptom of this broader leadership challenge [383].

In summary, Bessie's individual challenges and the school's response reflect the systemic issues highlighted in the BBC news report. Her experiences underscore the critical need for schools to move beyond paper-based support plans to consistent, tailored, and empathetic implementation, especially for neurodivergent students whose "poor behavior" is often a direct result of unmet needs and an overwhelming environment. The link between mental health support, effective teaching strategies, and student engagement is crucial to preventing the rise in suspensions and ensuring all children can "survive and thrive in a rapidly changing world" [387].

For your next step, you might consider preparing a list of questions to ask the school's senior leadership team about their plan to address the inconsistencies in SEND provision, specifically referencing Bessie's experiences and the recent Ofsted report's findings, to ascertain how they intend to translate policy into consistent classroom practice.The recent BBC news report highlights a concerning trend in England: school suspensions reached nearly a million in 2023/24, a 21% increase from the previous year, with exclusions also rising by 16% [373].

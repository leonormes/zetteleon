The sources paint a picture of a very difficult recent visit, which Zofja describes as "upsetting" and a "mess".

Here is a summary of what happened:

1. **The Trigger:** Bessie was "completely thrown" because the times changed twice without advance notice. Her support plan specifically notes that changes made to her day with no advance notice can make her feel deregulated.
2. **Bessie's Response:** She found the visit "very upsetting". Staff member Alex noted that while there was confusion around times, Bessie "coped well" and showed "resilience and calm". However, when Bessie got home, she was "really off" and refused to talk about anything for a period.
3. **Key Concerns Identified:**
   - **Rushing:** Bessie feels the transition is "all being rushed", a concern that Alex acknowledges needs to be discussed with Clair for planning after half-term.
   - **Support Person:** Bessie was panicked because she thought it was suggested that Lauren (her "safe person") might not be there next week. Leon (parent/carer) also relied on Lauren's presence to alleviate his worries. Zofja noted that changing the 'goal posts' regarding Lauren's support felt too quick after just one session.
   - **Curriculum Fit:** Zofja also raised immediate concerns about the plan to include English lessons over the next two weeks, as the class is doing Shakespeare (Macbeth), which is already stressful and confusing for Bessie due to dyslexia.

You are asking about the plan for what next and how things can be improved. This is addressed in several steps within the sources.

Based on the documentation, what was the immediate suggestion regarding the English lesson element of the plan, and what alternative subject did Bessie suggest trying instead?

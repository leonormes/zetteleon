title: Writing Strategies Must Be Consistently Supported by School

For writing-based support strategies to be effective for a student like Bessie, they must be implemented consistently by the school across all subjects.

Accommodations such as providing printed materials to eliminate the burden of copying from the board, or guaranteeing the use of a laptop for writing tasks, are vital. When these supports are applied inconsistently, their effectiveness is undermined, which can increase a student's stress and cognitive load.

A tool like a "[[Learning Passport]]" can empower a student to advocate for their own needs and ensure teachers are aware of the required accommodations.

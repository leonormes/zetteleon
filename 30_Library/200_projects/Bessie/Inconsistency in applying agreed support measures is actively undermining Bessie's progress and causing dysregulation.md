title: "Inconsistency in applying agreed support measures is actively undermining Bessie's progress and causing dysregulation"

Based on the review of the 'Pasted text input' and the supporting documents detailing Bessie's return-to-school plan and associated concerns, the suggested next steps for you as parents revolve around reinforcing consistency, ensuring adherence to the agreed support plan, and prioritizing emotional regulation and positive engagement.

The ‘Pasted text input’ highlights a critical challenge: **Inconsistency in applying agreed support measures is actively undermining Bessie's progress and causing dysregulation**. Bessie's return-to-school plan explicitly notes that being dysregulated is caused by changes made to her day with no advance notice, and by how school staff speak to her (including raised voices).

Here is a detailed review of the situation and suggested next steps, drawn from the sources:

---

## Phase 1: Immediate Clarification and Standardization (Addressing Inconsistency)

The most urgent step is to address the repeated issues that negate positive progress, especially the **hair conflict**, which the parents noted makes them feel "Hair clearly more important than education".

1. **Resolve the Uniform/Hair Issue Formally:**
    
    - The recent incidents show conflicting messages: on Monday, Bessie wouldn't be let in due to hair, but on Tuesday, it was "fine". On Thursday, Ms Rowland (AHT, listed as having access to the plan) said it was okay to tuck the hair behind the ear, yet after lunch, Mr Williams (DHT, listed as having access to the plan) and the office staff insisted she put it up, causing her to "kick off".
    - **Action:** Immediately communicate with the school leadership (e.g., Alex, who sent the draft plan, or Mr Higginson, HoY) requesting a definitive, written clarification of the uniform/hair policy *specifically applied to Bessie* to prevent further conflict.
    - **Rationale:** Changing expectations about appearance directly violates the core requirement in Bessie’s plan that changes should not be made to her day without advance notice, which is a known trigger for her dysregulation. School staff are required to read her learning profile and risk assessment, and know what does and does not help her.
2. **Reinforce Adherence to Existing Plans (IEP/Seating):**
    
    - The 'Pasted text' indicates issues in previous weeks, including the **IEP not being followed in Week 3** and **seating plans being changed without reason in Week 4**.
    - Bessie’s plan specifically states that a trigger for dysregulation is "Where I sit in my lessons – check I am happy with my seat".
    - **Action:** Contact the key staff (e.g., Amy Burch SENCO or Michael Higginson HoY) to highlight these documented breaches and request confirmation that all staff involved are reading and actively following the established support plan, which includes printing materials on blue paper and printing off PowerPoints. Inconsistency in support implementation is detrimental to successful reintegration.
3. **Ensure Consistent Key Adult Support:**
    
    - The parents were initially reassured by having Lauren, a "safe person," available. Although Alex previously noted Lauren's availability can’t be guaranteed due to other commitments, the plan for the week commencing 10.11.25 includes multiple sessions with Lauren and Alex.
    - **Action:** Use the Friday review meeting (if applicable for that week) to confirm a robust plan for cover if Lauren (or Alex) is unavailable, ensuring Bessie always has access to an agreed key adult from the list (Mrs Burch, Mr Higginson, etc.) when she needs time to regulate in SEN. She must not be left on her own if dysregulated.

## Phase 2: Leveraging Positive Engagement and Support

You should capitalize on the successes noted in the recent timeline.

1. **Prioritize Art and Compass Time:**
    
    - Bessie was "absolutely buzzing to do art" and had a "Greta day went into compass".
    - Art is listed as a strategy to help her regulate, and accessing Compass is a strategy allowed as she builds up time in school.
    - **Action:** Strongly advocate for scheduled, consistent time dedicated to Art and Compass access in the updated transition plan, linking this directly to her successful regulation on Thursday.
2. **Implement Positive Reflection Strategy:**
    
    - The support plan outlines a specific role for parents: "Reminders of positives – support in writing a list of positives of the day, at the end of each day".
    - **Action:** Use the examples from Wednesday ("Great day") and the positive experience of Art on Thursday (before the hair issue) to actively practice this strategy and help Bessie reframe negative feelings, as suggested in generalized advice for challenging negative thoughts. Continuing to be supportive even when she is dysregulated is also specified as a parent/carer action.
3. **Review Subject Choices:**
    
    - Bessie's earlier concern was about English due to the stress of *Macbeth* and assessments, suggesting Philosophy and Ethics might be better.
    - The revised plan for the week commencing 10.11.25 includes Philosophy and Ethics with Lauren.
    - **Action:** Check in with Bessie regarding her current feelings about Philosophy and Ethics, confirming that if she agrees to try it but struggles, this is fine, as Alex has previously re-iterated that the plan can be flexible.

## Phase 3: Long-Term Strategy and External Resources

1. **Discuss the Long-Term Flexible Plan:**
    
    - You have previously expressed the desire to discuss **flexible learning** options. Alex acknowledged that a long-term plan will involve everyone discussing the next steps and that they would be discussing Bessie with Clair for after half-term.
    - **Action:** Ensure the long-term discussion (with Clair or other appropriate staff) includes formalized flexible learning arrangements, rather than just the gradual exposure currently being employed. Make sure to explain that you and Bessie feel the transition is being rushed.
2. **Utilise Available Resources for EBSA and SEND:**
    
    - The challenges Bessie is facing align with issues of Emotional Based School Avoidance (EBSA). If strategies put in place by the school do not work, parents may want to speak to their GP or contact **SENDIASS Southend** for support, especially if the child has special educational needs (SEND) or a disability. Bessie’s diagnosis (dyslexia and ADHD) is acknowledged in the school plans.
    - **Action:** Review the resources provided in the sources for managing anxiety and sensory needs, such as the *Sensory checklist for schools* and the information on the "Fight, Flight, Freeze" response to anxiety. Ensure the school is implementing measures like noise reduction and designated quiet spaces, which are listed in the sensory checklist.
    - You can access support through websites like YoungMinds, which is a leading charity for children and young people's mental health and offers a parents helpline.

By focusing on these steps—primarily **eliminating implementation inconsistency** (especially regarding the hair) and **prioritizing known positive coping mechanisms** (Art, Compass)—you can better support Bessie’s return, which is currently being hindered by staff members contradicting the established support system.

This situation, where a student with high anxiety and specific support needs experiences repeated breakdowns in planned consistency due to staff intervention (like the hair issue), is like trying to build a wall with damp cement. You may have the blueprint (the support plan) and the materials, and you might get a few good bricks laid (positive days), but if the foundational element (consistency and staff buy-in) keeps failing, the whole structure of confidence and progress will collapse when external pressure is applied.

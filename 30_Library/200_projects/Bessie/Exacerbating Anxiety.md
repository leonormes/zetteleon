Bessie "wants to do well in school but is becoming aware of her difficulties". When she struggles and is told it's "her own fault" for not understanding, rather than receiving clearer explanations, it heightens her anxiety and fear of making mistakes. A lack of consistent feedback means she cannot discern small successes, which are crucial for building confidence and developing a growth mindset. This absence of clear progress indicators feeds into a vicious cycle where anxiety interferes with her ability to concentrate, learn, and engage, leading to further academic struggles and increased anxiety about getting work done.

It is understandable that you want to ensure Bessie's needs are consistently met, especially given the history of inconsistent support at Belfairs Academy [63, 69, 73, 80, 350, 351]. Here's a comprehensive overview of what was agreed, what evidence you should request, and your immediate next steps if the school has not made the necessary changes.

## Agreed Actions for the Follow-Up Meeting

Based on the "A Personalised Educational Pathway for Bessie Ormes" report and subsequent discussions and reviews, the following actions and strategies were identified as crucial for Bessie's support:

1. **Collaborative Team Meeting:** An immediate priority was for Bessie and her parents to request a meeting with the school's Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) and relevant Heads of Department [8].
2. **Formalized Accommodations and Access Arrangements:**
   - **Laptop Use:** Guaranteed use of a laptop for all extended writing tasks in class, homework, and internal/external examinations [8, 352-354].
   - **Printed Resources on Blue Paper:** A school-wide commitment to providing printed resources (handouts, worksheets, presentation slides) on blue paper to eliminate the need for copying from the board [8, 354-359].
   - **Extra Time:** Confirmation of her eligibility for 25% Extra Time in all timed examinations, which is a standard arrangement for students with her profile [8, 189, 202, 355].
   - **Anxiety Management:** An agreement on strategies for managing anxiety, such as pre-arranged access to a quiet space (sensory room/cubby) if she feels overwhelmed [8, 359-362].
3. **Learning Passport:** The SENCO was to work with Bessie to create a student-friendly, one-page summary of her key learning strategies and accommodations ("Learning Passport") for her to share with teachers, fostering ownership and advocacy [8].
4. **Communication and Review Cycle:** Agreement on a regular schedule for check-ins (e.g., every half-term) involving Bessie, her parents, and the SENCO or a designated mentor, to monitor strategies, adjust as needed, celebrate successes, and address challenges [8, 363].
5. **Addressing Inconsistencies & Staff Accountability:** A key concern was the "critical and damaging inconsistency" in how her needs were being met and the need to address the training and accountability of all staff who interact with Bessie [63, 69, 73, 79, 80, 82].
6. **Bessie's Letter to Staff:** Bessie was encouraged to write a letter to her teachers to explain her needs and request a fresh start, to be followed by one-to-one visits by staff [50, 51, 364, 365].
7. **Progress Tracking:** The suggestion of using a "report card" or similar mechanism for Bessie to track whether her needs are being addressed in each lesson [359, 364, 366].

## Evidence to Request and Review

To ascertain whether the school has implemented the agreed changes, you should specifically ask to see the following evidence:

- **Documented Implementation of Support Strategies:** Request to see concrete examples of how her Individual Education Plan (IEP)/Individual Support Plan (ISP) strategies are being applied in daily lessons across all subjects, not just in specific instances [232, 233, 363].
  - **Lesson Plans/Materials:** Ask for copies of differentiated lesson materials (e.g., worksheets, presentation slides on blue paper) that have been used in Bessie's lessons to show active adaptation for her dyslexia and difficulty copying from the board [354, 357-359, 363, 367].
  - **Evidence of Laptop Use:** Confirmation of consistent laptop use for extended writing and notes across subjects, including in-class work and tests [8, 352-354].
  - **Chunking/Scaffolding Examples:** Specific examples from different subject teachers demonstrating how complex tasks are broken down into manageable chunks and how scaffolding is provided for longer tasks, particularly in Maths [3-6, 230, 352, 368-370].
- **Teacher Briefings/Training Records:** Request evidence that all teaching staff have been explicitly briefed or trained on Bessie's specific needs (ADHD, dyslexia, anxiety, Mearles Irlen syndrome) and the agreed support strategies [371-378]. Ask for attendance records for any relevant professional development sessions.
- **Bessie's "Learning Passport":** Ask for a copy of the "Learning Passport" and how it has been shared with and utilized by her subject teachers [8].
- **Anxiety Management Protocol:** How is the "timeout card" system consistently managed across all lessons, and what evidence exists that staff understand and facilitate her access to a quiet space (sensory room/cubby) without negative repercussions, as opposed to telling her to leave the classroom? [359-362, 379, 380].
- **Progress Tracking Data:** Review the "report card" or similar tracking mechanisms to see if individual teachers are consistently marking whether Bessie's strategies are being applied, and what impact this has had on her engagement, punctuality, and academic progress across all subjects [359, 363, 364, 381].
- **Communication Log:** A detailed record of internal communications and follow-ups with teachers regarding Bessie's support [60-62, 67, 68, 70-72, 74-78, 83, 94, 99, 100, 102, 111, 114, 122, 124, 125, 127, 129-135, 137-148, 151-156, 158-163, 166-169, 171, 172, 174, 175].

## Escalation Steps if Changes Have Not Been Made

If, during the follow-up meeting, it is clear that the school has not consistently implemented the agreed-upon strategies and you are not satisfied with their progress, you should proceed with formal escalation. You have already given them time to make changes, and they are aware of the need for improvement, especially given the "Requires improvement" rating from their recent Ofsted report [32, 41, 382-384].

1. **Formal Written Complaint to the Principal and Board of Trustees:** Immediately follow up the meeting with a formal written complaint addressed to the Principal, Beverley Williams, and copy the Chair of the Board of Trustees, Kathy Herlock [32, 41, 385].
   - **Content of Complaint:** Clearly state your complaint, referencing specific instances where Bessie's Individual Education Plan (IEP)/Individual Support Plan (ISP) has been ignored or inconsistently applied [63, 69, 73, 80, 235, 351, 386]. Provide dates, times, and names of involved teachers where possible [386]. Detail the negative impact this has had on Bessie's learning, emotional well-being, and behavior, noting the discrepancy between her home and school behavior [351, 386, 387].
   - **Leverage Ofsted Findings:** Strategically refer to the Belfairs Academy Ofsted report, which rates "Quality of education" and "Leadership and management" as "Requires improvement" [32, 41, 382, 388].
     - Specifically cite the report's findings that "weaknesses in how the curriculum is taught mean that pupils do not achieve as well as they should" [34, 43, 389].
     - Point out that "teaching is not alert and responsive to mistakes that pupils make or the misconceptions that they have" [35, 44, 389].
     - Challenge the report's claim that "Teachers adapt resources well to meet the needs of individual pupils" with SEND, stating that this is not Bessie's experience and asking what the school is doing to ensure consistency [33, 42, 389].
     - Emphasize that the failure to implement Bessie's IEP is a symptom of the wider issue that leadership has not taken "timely and credible steps to assure itself that pupils' outcomes in Years 7 to 11 are likely to improve" [33, 42, 389].
   - **Desired Outcomes:** Clearly state what you expect the school to do to resolve the issue, aligning with the "A Personalised Educational Pathway" and prior agreements (e.g., immediate, consistent implementation of all agreed accommodations, specific staff training, regular review meetings with actionable outcomes) [8, 235, 363].
2. **Contact Local Authority SEND Team:** Inform the school that you will be contacting the Southend-on-Sea local authority's Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) team for advice and to explore mediation or disagreement resolution arrangements [22, 25, 236, 390]. This demonstrates your intent to use formal channels for resolution.
3. **Submit to Ofsted Parent View:** State your intention to immediately submit your detailed feedback to Ofsted Parent View, outlining the ongoing lack of consistent support and the negative impact on Bessie, as Ofsted uses this information when planning inspections [36, 45, 236, 390].

**Framework for Consideration:**
When discussing your concerns, you can frame the situation using the "Assess, Plan, Do, Review" cycle, which is a required "graduated approach" for SEND support [234]. You are essentially stating that while assessments and plans have been made, the "Do" (implementation) and "Review" (evaluation of effectiveness leading to adjustments) phases are failing, resulting in a breakdown of the support cycle [234, 244]. This positions your concerns within the school's own regulatory framework.

For your next step, I recommend drafting a concise and evidence-based letter to the Principal and Board of Trustees, incorporating the specific Ofsted findings and citing instances of non-compliance with Bessie's agreed support plan. This will serve as your formal escalation and set the stage for external involvement if needed.

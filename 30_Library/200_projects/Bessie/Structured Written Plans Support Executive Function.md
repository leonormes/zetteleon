For multi-step projects or complex problems, creating structured written plans is a critical support strategy for individuals like Bessie who face executive function challenges.

Visually mapping out a project, breaking it down into small and distinct tasks, and assigning clear deadlines helps to manage the workload effectively. This process externalizes the planning function, reducing the cognitive load and anxiety often associated with large, open-ended tasks. It provides a predictable, calming routine and a clear path forward.

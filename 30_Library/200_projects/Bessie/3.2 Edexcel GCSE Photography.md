## **Subject Overview**

- **Qualification:** GCSE (9-1) Art and Design (Photography) 5
- **Exam Board:** [[Edexcel]] 5
- **Key Topics:** The specification covers a broad range of photographic practices, including documentary photography, photo-journalism, studio and location photography, experimental imagery, and moving image (film and video). Students learn the technical aspects of using a camera (e.g., shutter speed, depth of field, focal points) and the creative application of formal elements. They will also explore digital and/or non-digital editing processes.5
- **Assessment:** The assessment structure is identical to that of [[Edexcel]] Art and Design, consisting of 100% NEA.
- **Component 1: Personal Portfolio (60%):** A portfolio of photographic work based on centre-set themes, including supporting studies and final pieces.5
- **Component 2: Externally Set Assignment (ESA) (40%):** Students respond to a theme set by [[Edexcel]], producing preparatory work and a final outcome in a 10-hour period of sustained focus.5
- Both components are assessed against the same four Assessment Objectives (AO1-AO4) as Art and Design.5

## **Tailored Learning & Study Recommendations for Bessie**

Photography provides a fantastic technical and technological outlet for Bessie's creativity, directly supporting her career ambitions in the film industry. A key advantage of this subject is how it reframes the assessment criteria. For AO3 (Record), the camera itself becomes the primary tool for "recording observations," which is a powerful alternative to the drawing and writing that can be challenging due to dyslexia.

- **Content Breakdown:** The technical nature of photography lends itself well to structured, chunked learning. Break down a photoshoot into a "shot list" checklist, a technique used professionally in film. Break down the digital editing process into a clear, step-by-step workflow (e.g., 1\. Import and backup photos; 2\. Rate and select the best images; 3\. Adjust exposure and colour; 4\. Crop and compose; 5\. Export for portfolio). This provides the clear, sequential structure that supports focus and reduces cognitive load.1
- **Engagement & Focus:** This subject offers a direct link to Bessie's career goals and personal interests. Project themes can be tailored to her passions: a documentary project on "A Day in the Life of a Stable"; a photo-journalism piece capturing the action at a local equestrian event; an experimental project using long exposures to capture the movement of horses; or a studio photography project where she photographs special effects make-up she has created herself.
- **Resource Adaptation:** Encourage the use of intuitive, visual editing software like Adobe Lightroom or Snapseed, which can be used on a tablet or phone. For her portfolio, she could create a professional-looking blog or a dedicated Instagram account (set to private for schoolwork). This is a modern, engaging way to present work and allows for annotations to be typed or added as audio captions, leveraging her laptop use and verbal skills.4
- **Active Learning Techniques:** This subject is inherently active. Encourage "photo walks" with a specific, single focus, such as "capturing texture" or "finding reflections." This breaks learning into manageable, engaging activities. To plan a narrative photo series, she can print small versions of her photos and physically arrange them into a storyboard, a tactile and visual planning method that avoids extensive writing.
- **Practice & Reinforcement:** Confidence in photography comes from practice. Encourage her to take photos regularly, even just with her phone. Setting up a small, informal "studio" at home with simple lights to photograph objects can build technical skills in a low-pressure, playful environment. Praise for a well-composed shot or a technically creative image will be a powerful motivator.
- **Anxiety Management:** As with Art, the 100% coursework model is a major anxiety-reducer.5 The practical, hands-on nature of the subject can be a form of mindfulness, helping to ground her and reduce anxious feelings. If she feels anxious about presenting her work in a traditional critique, she could create a pre-recorded video presentation of her portfolio, allowing her to control the narrative and use her strong verbal skills without the pressure of a live audience.
- **Leveraging Strengths:** Her creativity will excel in developing experimental images and strong compositions. Her inquisitive nature can drive compelling documentary projects. Photography provides another powerful avenue for her to demonstrate her unique perspective on the world, building a portfolio of work that is both academically valuable and personally meaningful.

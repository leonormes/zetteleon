**Subject**: Urgent Meeting: Safeguarding and Educational Provision for Bessie Ormes (Year 9)

Dear SENCO,

I am writing to you again with significant and renewed concerns regarding my daughter, Bessie Ormes, who recently returned to Belfairs Academy for Year 9. We had sincerely hoped that the new academic year would offer a fresh start for Bessie, particularly given her challenges in Year 8. As you know, these included difficulties with concentration and feeling overwhelmed in the sensory environment, alongside her diagnosis of ADHD (29/01/2024), ongoing anxiety, and a distressing self-harm incident on 7th June 2024.

Regrettably, our hopes for a positive transition have been immediately undermined. Within just two days of returning, Bessie's severe anxiety resurfaced, leading to another instance of self-harm. This confirms our fear that the school environment, as it currently stands, is unable to keep Bessie safe and is not conducive to her receiving an effective education.

Given these critical safeguarding concerns, we have made the difficult decision to keep Bessie at home. **Please be advised that Bessie is not being removed from the school roll; she is unable to attend due to the severe anxiety and risk the school environment currently poses to her well-being.** We therefore need to meet urgently to discuss the path forward.

We request an urgent meeting to collaboratively address the following points:

1. **School's Assessment**: We need to understand the school's perspective on Bessie's rapid decline upon her return and its view on its ability to ensure her safety and facilitate her learning.
2. **Proposed Next Steps**: We would like to hear the school's proposals for Bessie's educational future, considering her current inability to thrive or remain safe within the school setting.
3. **Support for Alternatives**: Should an alternative educational pathway be necessary, we need to know what support the school can offer to facilitate this transition and contribute to her learning.
4. **Formal Request for EHC Needs Assessment**: Given Bessie's complex and escalating needs, **we are formally requesting that the school make an immediate application for an Education, Health and Care (EHC) needs assessment to the Local Authority.** We ask that you begin preparing the required educational advice without delay to avoid prolonging Bessie's time without a suitable educational placement.

We are keen to work with the school to ensure Bessie's well-being and access to an appropriate education. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to arrange this meeting. We would appreciate it if this could take place by the end of this week.

**For the meeting to be productive, it is essential that Bessie's CAMHS worker, Lisa Dorling, is able to attend.** We also request the attendance of a Local Authority representative, such as Cathy Braun (Head of Access and Inclusion). If their attendance is not possible on the day, we insist that formal minutes are taken and distributed to all parties afterwards.

Sincerely,

Leon Ormes

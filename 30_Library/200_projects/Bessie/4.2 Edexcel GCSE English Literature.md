## **Tailored Learning & Study Recommendations for Bessie**

The main hurdles in English Literature are the memory load required for closed-book exams and the challenge of analysing dense, often archaic, language. The strategies must focus on making the texts accessible and the key information memorable.

- **Content Breakdown:** Do not try to memorise the entire text. Instead, for each text, focus on memorising 15-20 key, short, powerful quotations that can be used to support a wide range of arguments. For each key quote, create a flashcard (on blue card) with the quote on one side and a bullet-point analysis on the back (who says it, when, what themes it links to, what literary devices it uses). This chunks the revision into manageable units.
- **Engagement & Focus:** Use film and stage adaptations as a gateway to the texts. Watching a good film version of *Macbeth* before reading the play can provide the narrative and character framework, making the language less intimidating. Connect themes to her interests. The theme of ambition in *Macbeth* can be compared to the ambition of characters in films she enjoys. The social injustice in *An Inspector Calls* or *A Christmas Carol* will resonate with her caring nature.
- **Resource Adaptation:** Use adapted, dyslexia-friendly versions of the texts where possible (e.g., with larger font, more spacing, and a summary alongside the original text). Audiobooks are essential. Listening to the text while following along in the book reinforces learning through two sensory channels and aids comprehension.4 All notes and essays must be typed on a laptop.
- **Active Learning Techniques:** Instead of just writing essays, bring the texts to life. Create character maps or relationship webs on large sheets of paper. Hot-seat characters, where Bessie can ask questions to a character (played by a teacher or peer) to explore their motivations. For poetry, she could create a visual collage or a short film that represents the poem's mood and imagery, linking to her skills in Art and Photography.
- **Practice & Reinforcement:** The closed-book nature of the exams means memory is key. Regular, low-stakes quizzing on key quotes and character details is vital. Use the "look, cover, write, check" method for learning quotes. Practice planning essays in detail under timed conditions before writing them fully. A good plan is the key to a good essay.
- **Anxiety Management:** The closed-book format is a known anxiety trigger. The flashcard system for key quotes provides a tangible and achievable revision goal, which builds confidence. Knowing she has a "toolkit" of 15 powerful quotes to take into the exam is a huge comfort. For the unseen poetry section, use a consistent analysis framework (e.g., 'SMILE': Structure, Meaning, Imagery, Language, Effect) to provide a clear process to follow when faced with something new.
- **Leveraging Strengths:** Her strong verbal ability is perfect for discussing and debating character motivations and themes in class. This verbal processing will be key to her developing a deep understanding. Her creativity can be used to find unique interpretations of the texts and to make insightful connections between them. Her thoughtfulness will allow her to engage deeply with the complex moral and ethical questions the texts raise.

Subject: Urgent: Educational Provision for Bessie Ormes (Year 9, Belfairs Academy) & Request for LA Attendance at Meeting

Dear Ms Warner,

I am writing to you regarding my daughter, Bessie Ormes, a Year 9 pupil on the roll at Belfairs Academy. I am contacting your service directly as we are facing a crisis regarding her education and safety.

Following a serious self-harm incident at the school last Thursday, we have had to keep Bessie at home. It is clear the school environment is a direct trigger for her severe anxiety and, as such, is currently unsafe for her.

Bessie has an NHS diagnosis for ADHD, is on the CAMHS pathway for an ASD assessment, and has a documented history of mental health challenges linked to school. A recurring pattern has emerged where her well-being dramatically improves when she is away from school (e.g., over the summer holidays) but rapidly deteriorates upon her return. Despite extensive engagement with the school to manage this, the situation has now become untenable.

We have a meeting scheduled with the SENCO and Headteacher at Belfairs Academy this **Wednesday, 17th September 2025**, to discuss a way forward. At our request, the school has also begun the process of applying for an Education, Health and Care (EHC) needs assessment.

Given the complexity of Bessie's needs and her inability to access education in her current setting, we believe it is crucial for a Local Authority representative to be involved at this stage. We formally request that you, or a suitable colleague from your team, attend the meeting on Wednesday. Your department's input would be invaluable in advising on the available pathways and ensuring a collaborative, multi-agency solution can be found for Bessie promptly.

I can provide more detailed background information if needed. Please let me know if attendance from your office will be possible.

Kind regards,

Leon Ormes

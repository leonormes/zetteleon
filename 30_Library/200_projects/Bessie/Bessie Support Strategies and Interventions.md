## Individual Support Plan (ISP) Core Strategies

### Task Management

- Breaking down large tasks into achievable chunks
- Visual and verbal prompts for strategies
- Scaffolding for longer tasks
- Opportunities to build success and complete tasks independently

### Resource Adaptations

- **Blue paper/books** for Meares-Irlen Syndrome
- **Laptop use** for longer writing tasks and summative tests
- **Printed materials** rather than copying from board
- **Extra time** for processing information

### Emotional Support

- Opportunities to talk about worries
- Allowing Bessie to "air grievances" with active listening
- Access to quiet spaces/sensory room
- Time-out card for self-regulation

### Instructional Support

- Prompting to stay focused and on task
- Positive praise for effort and strategies
- Clear explanations when difficulties arise
- Seating arrangements to support focus

## Current Interventions

### Academic Support

- Small English/Maths sets (16 children daily)
- Spelling/reading program (Lexia)
- Regular support with learning mentor (1-2 times weekly)
- Maths intervention (5 weeks, twice weekly from Oct 2023)

### Wellbeing Support

- Weekly counselling sessions (starting May 2025)
- Breathing techniques for relaxation
- Barrier games for social skills development
- Regular chats about interests

## Implementation Challenges

### Consistency Issues

- Inconsistent application across all subjects and teachers
- Variable understanding of ADHD and dyslexia needs
- Promised resources not always provided
- Teacher attitudes and responses vary significantly

### Effectiveness Gaps

- 5-minute anxiety breaks insufficient without guided support
- Punitive responses to anxiety-driven behaviors
- Lack of clear feedback on performance
- Over-reliance on traditional teaching methods

## Character Development Connection

Effective support strategies can foster character strengths from the [[Character and Virtue MOC]]:

**[[VIA Virtue of Temperance]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Temperance|Self-Regulation (Self-Control)]]**: Learning to use support tools appropriately
- **[[VIA Virtue of Temperance|Prudence]]**: Making good choices about when to seek help

**[[VIA Virtue of Courage]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Perseverance (Persistence)]]**: Continuing to engage despite challenges
- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Honesty (Integrity)]]**: Advocating for her own needs

**[[VIA Virtue of Humanity]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Humanity|Social Intelligence]]**: Understanding and communicating support needs

When implemented consistently, support strategies build independence and self-advocacy skills that become character strengths.

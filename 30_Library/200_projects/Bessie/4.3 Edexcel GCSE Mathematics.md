## **Subject Overview**

- **Qualification:** GCSE (9-1) Mathematics 24
- **Exam Board:** [[Edexcel]] 24
- **Key Topics:** The curriculum is comprehensive, covering six main areas: Number; Algebra; Ratio, Proportion and rates of change; Geometry and Measures; Probability; and Statistics. The content is available at two tiers: Foundation (grades 1-5) and Higher (grades 4-9).24
- **Assessment:** The qualification is assessed entirely by three written exam papers, each 1 hour and 30 minutes long and worth 80 marks.
  - **Paper 1: Non-Calculator**
  - **Paper 2: Calculator Allowed**
  - **Paper 3: Calculator Allowed**
  - Each paper assesses the full range of topics, so knowledge must be maintained across all areas.24

## **Tailored Learning & Study Recommendations for Bessie**

Mathematics can be a source of anxiety, particularly for students with dyslexia due to the demands on working memory and sequencing. Bessie's profile indicates lower spatial ability, which will make Geometry challenging, but also highlights a strength in basic arithmetic, which is a crucial foundation. The key is to build on this strength, make abstract concepts concrete, and manage anxiety through structured, confidence-building practice.

- **Content Breakdown:** Each topic in the specification must be broken down into its smallest component skills on a checklist.4 For example, the 'Algebra' topic is vast; a sub-topic like 'Solving Equations' should be broken into 'Solving one-step equations', 'Solving two-step equations', 'Solving equations with brackets', etc. This allows Bessie to see her progress as she ticks off each small skill, building a sense of accomplishment. The "Pomodoro Technique" (25 minutes of practice, 5-minute break) is vital for maintaining focus during homework and revision.4
- **Engagement & Focus:** Relate mathematical concepts to her interests. This makes the abstract tangible and relevant.
  - **Ratio & Proportion:** Calculate the correct mixture of ingredients for special effects materials or scale up a recipe for horse feed.
  - **Geometry & Measures:** Analyse perspective in her own artwork or photographs. Calculate the area of a paddock or the volume of a water trough.
  - **Statistics:** Analyse data from a film's box office success or track the performance statistics of a famous event horse.
- **Resource Adaptation:** All worksheets must be printed, ideally on blue paper, with plenty of white space and clear, sans-serif font. Use online learning platforms like Corbettmaths, which pair short, chunked video tutorials with interactive quizzes. This format is ideal for her learning style. For foundational concepts, use physical manipulatives like a number line, algebra tiles, or 3D shapes to provide a concrete, tactile experience.
- **Active Learning Techniques:** Create large, colourful posters or mind maps for key formulae, using mnemonic devices to aid recall (e.g., SOH CAH TOA for trigonometry).8 Use two-sided flashcards for key vocabulary and formulae, which can be used for quick-fire revision.4 A powerful technique is for her to "teach" a concept she has just learned back to a parent or peer. Explaining the steps out loud reinforces her own understanding and uses her verbal strengths.
- **Practice & Reinforcement:** The "little and often" approach is crucial. Short, daily practice of 15-20 minutes is far more effective than one long, draining session per week. Begin with her area of strength—Number. Securing her skills in arithmetic, fractions, and percentages will build a huge amount of confidence. Praise her effort, her logical thinking, and her perseverance, not just whether the final answer is correct. This fosters a growth mindset.
- **Anxiety Management:** Maths anxiety is real and must be acknowledged openly.2 Create a "traffic light" system on her topic checklist (green for 'I get this', amber for 'I'm a bit unsure', red for 'I need help'). This is a low-pressure way for her to communicate her needs to her teacher. Frame mistakes not as failures, but as "detective work" to find out where the process went astray. This reduces the fear of being wrong. Ensure she has her own calculator that she is familiar with and can use fluently, as this is a key tool and source of security in two of the three exams.
- **Leveraging Strengths:** Her strength in addition and subtraction is the bedrock of the Number topic. Her inquisitive nature can be channelled into the problem-solving aspects of maths. Encourage her to ask "What if I tried this?" Her strong verbal skills can be used to talk through her working step-by-step. This process of verbalising her thoughts can often help her to spot her own errors and clarify her logic. The decision on whether to enter the Foundation or Higher tier is critical and should be made later in the course, based on where she is feeling most confident.

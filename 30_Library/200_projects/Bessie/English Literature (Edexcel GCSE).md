- Curriculum Content: Students will study a Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a modern novel or play (published after 1914), and a collection of poetry. They will also analyze unseen poetry. The course aims to foster a love of reading and critical engagement with literary texts, analyzing language, form, and structure, and forming independent critical judgments.
- Alignment with Bessie's Profile:
  - Strengths: This subject supports progress to A-Level English Literature and other Level 3 courses. Bessie's enjoyment of history and her strong verbal abilities could be assets when exploring the historical and social contexts of literary works. The analytical nature of the course might appeal to her inquisitive mind.
  - Learning Needs: Similar to English Language, the heavy reliance on reading and written analysis will require consistent support, such as blue paper resources and the use of a laptop. Bessie may need scaffolding for longer analytical tasks and opportunities for oral rehearsal before verbal responses.

Bessie demonstrates a strong capacity for independent work and self-motivation when tasks align with her interests and when she has appropriate support structures in place. This strength can be leveraged to develop her autonomy and confidence in learning.

## Evidence-Based Strategies for ADHD Independence

### Hyperfocus Management

- [[Adhd 2.0]] - Understanding when Bessie is in the Task-Positive Network (TPN): "When you're thinking with the TPN, you're in the Angel mindset. But you can also get trapped in the TPN, doing a task from which you cannot disengage. This is the hyperfocused state that people with ADHD can fall into."

### Adaptive Focus Techniques

- [[Learn Like a Pro]] - Adaptive Pomodoro that works with natural hyperfocus patterns while ensuring breaks prevent overwhelm
- [[Gain focus and productivity with the Pomodoro Technique]] - Customizing work sessions: "You can adjust the length of pomodoro sessions to align with your work habits... As long as you're following the work-break pattern, you can still reap the benefits"

### Self-Starting Strategies

- [[Solving the Procrastination Puzzle]] - Implementation intentions for task initiation: "IF I say something to myself like 'Oh, I'll feel more like doing this tomorrow,' I will catch myself in this self-deception and add 'THEN I will just get started on the task' instead"

## Character Development Connection

This capacity for independent work reflects several key character strengths from the [[Character and Virtue MOC]]:

**[[VIA Virtue of Courage]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Perseverance (Persistence)]]**: Finishing what one starts; persisting in a course of action despite obstacles
- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Zest (Vitality)]]**: Approaching life with excitement and energy; living life as an adventure

**[[VIA Virtue of Temperance]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Temperance|Self-Regulation (Self-Control)]]**: Regulating what one feels and does; being disciplined; controlling one's appetites and emotions
- **[[VIA Virtue of Temperance|Prudence]]**: Being careful about one's choices; not taking undue risks

Her ability to work independently when properly supported demonstrates emerging self-discipline and persistence that can be cultivated into mature character virtues.

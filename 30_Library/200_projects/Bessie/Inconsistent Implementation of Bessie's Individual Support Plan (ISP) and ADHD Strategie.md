Based on the Ofsted report, the UK government's implied expectations for SEN support, and the comprehensive information about your daughter Bessie, here is a summary of the failings of Belfairs Academy that you can raise in a meeting:

## Inconsistent Implementation of Bessie's Individual Support Plan (ISP) and ADHD Strategies

- Despite Bessie having an ISP in place since Year 7 and an ADHD diagnosis confirmed in January 2024, her experience reveals a significant lack of consistent implementation across all lessons and teachers.
- Processing Information & Task Management: Bessie reports not consistently receiving extra time to process information or complete tasks, especially large ones. While Belfairs states that class teachers and the Targeted Services team work closely to ensure information and strategies are shared and work is personalised, Bessie finds large tasks are often only broken down once, for new concepts, and not consistently thereafter.
- Academic Tools & Material Use: Bessie states that teachers do not consistently provide keywords or the long date for copying from the board, expecting her to copy handwritten notes, and she has "never had anything like that". While blue paper is used in some subjects like English, Maths, Science, and History, it is "not in all subjects" despite being recommended for her Mearles Irlen syndrome. She can ask to use her laptop for longer writing tasks and tests, but it's not consistently offered or expected.
- Support for Learning Difficulties: Bessie reports that when she struggles with spelling or forgets something, teachers often "yell" or tell her to "get out" instead of providing support, with only some teachers offering one-to-one explanations. This contradicts the school's policy of quality first teaching and additional support for those with adaptations.
- Praise for Effort: Bessie states that teachers do not consistently praise her effort or the strategies she uses, focusing instead on getting the "right" answer. This contradicts the recommended approach of supporting a growth mindset in children with anxiety.

## Inadequate Emotional and Mental Health Support, Particularly regarding Anxiety and Bullying

- Anxiety Management: Bessie reports feeling anxious in school situations and overwhelmed, and her teachers' support is limited to a "five minutes out of class" time-out, which she finds insufficient for true anxiety and lacks guidance on how to calm down. She feels her teachers "don't understand" her needs when she is anxious. While Belfairs boasts an "extensive pastoral team" and works with NHS Educational Mental Health Practitioners, Bessie's experience suggests a significant gap in tailored, effective support for her emotional distress, especially given her ADHD and potential AuDHD traits which intensify emotions. The concept of "masking" her struggles at school, as highlighted in expert resources, appears to be largely unrecognised or unsupported by the school's approach.
- Asking for Help: While Bessie "kind of" feels comfortable asking for help when stuck, teachers' responses vary, sometimes involving negative comments like "you weren't listening" if she gets an answer wrong. This undermines a supportive learning environment.

## Failures in Monitoring and Reviewing Progress and Parental Partnership

- Assessment & Feedback: The Ofsted report identifies a general failing where the school "has not thought enough about how to check what pupils know and understand as they progress through the curriculum" and that "teaching does not identify the gaps or misconceptions in pupils’ understanding as they arise". Bessie's own statement that she has to "guess" how well she's doing in her subjects and make her "own self-judgment" directly supports this broader failing.
- Parental Involvement: The Belfairs Academy SEND policy states an objective to "Support a partnership with parents/carers, valuing their views and contributions and keeping them fully involved in their child’s education". However, Bessie's October 2024 review explicitly notes "Parent’s viewsnone available at time of review", indicating a direct failure in this stated objective and hindering the effectiveness of the "Assess, Plan, Do, Review" system the school claims to use.

## Insufficient Staff Training and Awareness Regarding Complex Neurodevelopmental Needs

- The overall inconsistency in strategy implementation and the negative responses from some teachers (yelling, kicking out of class) strongly suggest that the school's stated regular SEND training and Continual Professional Development for staff is not effectively equipping all teachers to support students like Bessie.
- The school's apparent lack of understanding or effective response to Bessie's "two different people" phenomenon (contrasting behaviour at home vs. school) and her self-harm linked to school issues, points to a need for more "neurodiversity-informed advocacy" and training on understanding masking and emotional dysregulation in adolescent girls with ADHD and potential ASD.

These points highlight a significant disparity between Belfairs Academy's stated policies and Ofsted's general positive observations regarding SEND support, versus the actual day-to-day experience and critical needs of Bessie.

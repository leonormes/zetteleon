**Meeting Transcript – Teachers – Wednesday at 09:16**

The meeting began with a discussion about Bessie spending time in the sensory room. It was agreed that it’s good for her to be there for part of the time.

The main purpose of the meeting was to go through concerns about the inconsistency in how Bessie’s needs are being met. The plan was to address these point by point, looking at the current situation and steps moving forward. Miss Birch was present to discuss the SEN aspects. The access request for Bessie’s full report will be forwarded to the admin team, who will send it out.

There was a check-in about any recent concerns, especially regarding self-harm. It was noted that Bessie had worn a bandage but has since removed it, and there are no new marks. She hasn’t been in school for the last two days due to bad headaches, which may be anxiety-related or migraines, as these run in the family. At home, Bessie is relaxed and engaged in creative activities, such as playing computer games and raising virtual wolf dogs.

Looking ahead to Year 9, there is optimism that Bessie will benefit from choosing her own subjects and having fewer teachers. She has chosen subjects like photography, which play to her strengths and creativity. There was some disappointment about having to do double RE, but she is interested in topics like crime and punishment.

The last meeting about Bessie was in March, where issues in science were discussed. She was trialling a group that didn’t work for her, so her science group was changed, and she seems happier. Geography and maths were also discussed; maths was improving, and English was good. Staff were briefed about her ADHD and dyslexia, and an email was sent to staff about her needs.

Self-harm was discussed in March, and it was agreed that Bessie should be in the PE department even if not participating in lessons, and to bring her kit. CAMHS group sessions had finished, but a re-referral will be made if needed.

There was concern that, despite support outside lessons, Bessie’s classroom experience is negative and affecting her love of learning. At home, her behaviour is different from what is seen at school. There was a reflection on the school’s responsibility to provide quality teaching and the need for consistency in implementing her IEP. Some teachers are not adapting their teaching for her ADHD, and there is too much reliance on copying from the board, which is not effective for her.

Bessie’s engagement in lessons like history, where the teacher uses varied methods, was highlighted as positive. In contrast, geography is challenging due to the teacher-student relationship. There is a perception that some teachers do not recognise or accommodate her needs, especially with tasks like copying from the board, which is particularly difficult for her due to dyslexia.

The discussion moved to Bessie’s experience in lessons. She reported that instructions are often only explained once, and if she doesn’t understand, she is blamed for not listening. Support staff are present but often focus on other students. When explanations are repeated, they are usually just slower, not clearer. Bessie finds copying from the board in most lessons difficult and would benefit from having printed materials or PowerPoints.

In some subjects, like history, the teacher consistently provides blue paper and printed materials, which helps. However, this is not consistent across all subjects. Bessie named teachers who have told her to leave the classroom for not understanding, which escalates quickly when she asks for help and is told it’s her fault.

There was a discussion about the change in Bessie’s behaviour since January, which coincided with a difficult relationship with a particular teacher. Previously, she had no issues and was doing well.

The group discussed the impact of reputation and how repeated removals from class have affected how teachers respond to Bessie. There is a need to distinguish between what Bessie can control and what is outside her control.

Strategies for supporting Bessie were discussed, including the use of a timeout card, access to well-being spaces, and the possibility of using music or drawing to help her regulate. The importance of having a checklist of strategies and a dedicated space for her to use was raised.

There was agreement that more needs to be done in lessons to make them accessible and engaging for Bessie, not just relying on support outside the classroom. The need for consistent implementation of her IEP across all subjects was emphasised.

The idea of Bessie writing a letter to her teachers to explain her needs and request a fresh start was suggested. This would be followed up with one-to-one visits to ensure her needs are being met. There was also discussion about using a report card for Bessie to track whether her needs are being addressed in each lesson.

The group agreed to review progress in a month, allowing time for teachers to implement changes. Success would be measured by consistent use of blue paper, provision of printed materials, and Bessie’s engagement with lessons.

The meeting concluded with a summary of actions: Bessie will write a letter to staff, there will be follow-up visits, and strategies will be reinforced with staff. The aim is to ensure Bessie’s needs are met consistently and to support her in engaging positively with her education.

The meeting regarding Bessie's IEP highlighted significant concerns about the inconsistent implementation of her support strategies across Belfairs Academy.

**Main Points of Concern:**

- **Inconsistent IEP Implementation:** Bessie's support strategies, as outlined in her IEP, are not being consistently applied by all teachers. While some teachers are supportive (e.g., Miss Harvey in History), others are perceived as not understanding or even rejecting the need for adaptations.
- **Teaching Methodology:** Teachers often explain concepts only once, expecting Bessie to remember without further support, especially for previously taught topics. There is an excessive reliance on copying notes from the board, which is difficult for Bessie, and teachers do not consistently provide printed materials or keywords. Lessons are often not interactive enough for her learning style.
- **Impact on Bessie's Engagement and Well-being:** This inconsistency and lack of adaptation are "destroying her love of learning". Bessie's struggles lead to defiance, rudeness, and refusal to attend subsequent lessons, as she has learned that being "kicked out" is a way to escape difficult situations. She experiences significant anxiety and feels overwhelmed in noisy or busy school environments, and the current 5-minute timeout pass is often insufficient for severe distress. Her behaviour has also led to a negative reputation with some teachers and is impacting her friendships.
- **Self-Harm Concerns:** Recent self-harm (scratches) and recurring headaches, possibly anxiety-related, are additional concerns, though Bessie does not openly discuss these issues.

**Agreed Next Actions:**

To address these issues and ensure a more supportive learning environment for Bessie, the following actions were agreed upon:

1. **Bessie's Letter and Staff Email:** Bessie will draft a letter to her teaching staff, outlining her challenges and emphasizing the need for a "fresh start" in how her needs are met. This will be supported by an email to all staff, reminding them of Bessie's specific support plan and strategies.
2. **One-to-one Teacher Visits:** The welfare team will conduct individual visits with Bessie's teachers, particularly those for her Year 9 subjects, to discuss her needs in detail before the new academic year begins.
3. **Daily Check-ins and Report Card:** Daily check-ins with Bessie will be implemented to monitor the consistent application of her IEP provisions, such as the provision of dark blue paper and printed handouts. Bessie will also have a dedicated book to record her notes and provide evidence of support received.
4. **Printed Materials/Handouts:** Teachers will be instructed to provide printed materials, PowerPoints, and questions on worksheets to reduce Bessie's need to copy extensive notes from the board, especially in Maths and Science.
5. **Laptop Use:** The option for Bessie to use a laptop for longer writing tasks and summative tests will be clearly established, with time allocated for her to log on at the start of lessons.
6. **Enhanced Anxiety Management:** Bessie's use of the "timeout" process will be improved by providing access to calming tools like an MP3 player for music, sketchbooks, art paper, and fidget objects within a quiet, dedicated space (e.g., the sensory cubby or an independent intervention room). A "Bessie checklist" will be created as a reminder of these strategies.
7. **Positive Detention Outcome:** An outstanding technology detention will be reframed as a one-to-one session with Bessie to discuss her interests, such as art, photography, film, or sewing, aiming for a positive outcome and building rapport.
8. **Parental Input:** The parent's views are needed for Bessie's current IEP review.
9. **Teacher Training:** The broader need for comprehensive teacher training on ADHD and dyslexia, particularly focusing on female presentations and effective pedagogical approaches, was emphasized for long-term improvement.

The next step would be to ensure these agreed actions are formally documented and shared with all relevant staff, setting clear timelines and responsibilities for implementation to ensure accountability and consistent support for Bessie.The meeting focused on addressing the **inconsistent implementation of Bessie's Individualized Education Program (IEP)** and her resulting struggles at school.

**Main Points of Concern:**

- **Teacher Understanding and Adaptation:** There is a significant lack of consistent adaptation by teachers to Bessie's needs, particularly regarding her ADHD and dyslexia. Some teachers are perceived as outright rejecting the validity of her diagnosis or are unwilling to adjust their teaching methods.
- **Ineffective Teaching Methods:** Bessie struggles with copying large amounts of notes from the board, a frequent practice in most lessons, and is rarely provided with printed materials or keywords. Explanations are often given only once or repeated in the same, unhelpful manner, without sufficient time for processing. This lack of engaging and interactive lessons contributes to her disengagement.
- **Behavioral Impact:** Bessie's difficulties in lessons lead to defiance, rudeness, and a refusal to attend subsequent classes, indicating a negative cycle where she seeks to be "kicked out" to avoid frustrating learning environments. This behavior has damaged her reputation with some teachers and is impacting her friendships.
- **Anxiety and Overwhelm:** Bessie experiences significant anxiety and feels overwhelmed by the school environment. The current 5-minute time-out pass for anxiety is deemed insufficient for genuine distress, as it lacks guidance on calming strategies.
- **Recent Self-Harm:** Recent incidents of self-harm (scratches) were noted, and Bessie has been experiencing headaches, potentially linked to her anxiety. This highlights a deeper level of distress that needs addressing.

**Agreed Next Actions:**

To improve Bessie's educational experience and support her well-being, the following actions were agreed upon:

1. **Direct Communication from Bessie:** Bessie will draft a letter to her teaching staff to explain her challenges and the impact they have on her, and to express her desire for a fresh start. This letter can also showcase her talents (e.g., special effects makeup) to foster a more holistic understanding.
2. **Staff Reminders and Training:** An email will be sent to all staff reminding them of Bessie's support plan and specific strategies (e.g., extra processing time, breaking down tasks, visual aids, laptop use for longer writing, blue paper for resources). The importance of comprehensive teacher training on ADHD and dyslexia, particularly female presentations, was also highlighted.
3. **One-to-One Teacher Visits:** The welfare team will conduct individual follow-up visits with Bessie's teachers, focusing on her Year 9 subjects, to ensure personalized understanding and commitment to implementing her IEP.
4. **Daily Monitoring and Report Card:** Daily check-ins with Bessie will be initiated to verify that her IEP provisions, such as consistent use of dark blue paper and printed handouts, are being met in all lessons. Bessie will maintain her own record book for this purpose.
5. **Addressing Homework/Printed Materials:** Teachers will be directed to provide printed materials (e.g., PowerPoints, questions on worksheets) to minimize the need for Bessie to copy extensively from the board, particularly in Maths and Science.
6. **Enhanced Anxiety Management:** Bessie's use of the time-out process will be reviewed and improved to include access to calming tools like an MP3 player for music, sketchbooks, art paper, and fidget objects in a dedicated quiet space. A "Bessie checklist" will also be developed to guide her through breathing techniques and affirmations during moments of heightened anxiety.
7. **Positive Re-engagement:** An outstanding technology detention will be reframed as a one-to-one opportunity to positively re-engage Bessie by discussing her interests (e.g., art, photography, film, sewing).
8. **Parental Input:** The parent's input is requested for Bessie's current IEP review.
9. **"Fresh Starts":** Teachers are encouraged to reset at the beginning of each lesson, offering Bessie a "fresh start" rather than carrying over negative perceptions from previous interactions.

The next critical step is to schedule a formal follow-up meeting with Bessie, her parents, and the relevant school staff, including the SENCo and key teachers, to establish clear accountability for these actions and set a review date to assess their impact on Bessie's learning and well-being.

The 'Review' stage involves monitoring progress against outcomes, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, and making necessary adjustments.

Current Review Practices & Findings:

- Belfairs Academy uses the APDR system and reviews students regularly.
- Parents are to be involved in the decision-making process and receive copies of the Learning Profile, with targets reviewed twice a year.
- Bessie's latest review was October 2024, noting "Part met," "carried over," and "mostly met" outcomes.
- Student views were recorded ("perfectly fine" but "annoying" elements, needs more time).
- Parent views were "none available at time of review", highlighting a critical breakdown in the review process.
- An agreement for a one-month review was made following the recent meeting to check on consistent use of blue paper, printed materials, and Bessie's engagement.

Recommended Review Timelines and Practices:

- Immediate Follow-up: The agreed one-month review should occur promptly (e.g., by July 11, 2025, if the meeting was July 11, 2025 based on conversation and prom date).
- Regular Formal Reviews: Formal meetings involving Bessie, her parents, and the SENCO (or designated mentor) should be scheduled at least half-termly (e.g., every ~6-7 weeks), as recommended for consistent feedback.
- Annual IEP/ISP Review: The overall Individual Education Plan/Individual Support Plan (ISP) should be formally reviewed at least twice per year (e.g., October and March/April) to align with Belfairs' policy and ensure targets are updated.
- Exam Access Arrangements: These are usually applied for at the start of a course (e.g., Year 9 for GCSEs) and must be approved before examinations.
- ADHD Follow-up: The clinical follow-up for Bessie's ADHD diagnosis is recommended every 6 months. This information should feed directly into her educational plan reviews.
- Short-term Goal Cycle: For specific challenging areas or new strategies, implement short-term goals with a 2-4 week review cycle to allow for rapid adjustments and build confidence.
- Success Metrics: Success will be measured by Bessie's reported experience of consistent support (e.g., consistent use of blue paper, provision of printed materials), increased engagement in lessons, and progress towards her academic and personal outcomes.
- Problem-Solving: When progress is slow or new challenges arise, use a structured problem-solving approach to identify the root cause, brainstorm solutions, evaluate them, and implement the best fit.

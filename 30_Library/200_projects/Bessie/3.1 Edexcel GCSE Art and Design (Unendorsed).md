## **Subject Overview**

- **Qualification:** GCSE (9-1) Art and Design
- **Exam Board:** [[Edexcel]]
- **Key Topics:** The unendorsed nature of this course is a significant advantage, as it allows students to explore a wide variety of approaches without being limited to a single specialism. Bessie will be able to work with diverse media and techniques across areas such as fine art (painting, drawing), sculpture, ceramics, and printmaking.6 The curriculum is designed to develop visual creativity, analytical skills through the study of other artists, and the ability to direct one's own learning by developing personal ideas from a range of starting points.5
- **Assessment:** The assessment is 100% Non-Exam Assessment (NEA), or coursework. This structure is inherently suited to students who benefit from developing work over time rather than performing under high-stakes, timed conditions.
- **Component 1: Personal Portfolio (60%):** This is a portfolio of work based on themes, projects, or tasks set by the school. It must include supporting studies (research, experiments, developmental pieces) and one or more resolved personal outcomes. This component makes up the majority of the final grade.
- **Component 2: Externally Set Assignment (ESA) (40%):** [[Edexcel]] releases a broad thematic starting point. Students then undertake a preparatory period to research and develop ideas, culminating in a 10-hour period of "sustained focus" under supervised conditions to produce a final outcome.
- Both components are marked internally against four Assessment Objectives (AOs): AO1 (Develop ideas), AO2 (Refine work through experimentation), AO3 (Record ideas and observations), and AO4 (Present a personal and meaningful response).

## **Tailored Learning & Study Recommendations for Bessie**

This subject should be positioned as an "anchor" for Bessie—a space where she can feel confident, successful, and in control. The assessment structure, based entirely on portfolio work, removes the pressure of traditional written exams, which can be a significant source of anxiety, and is exceptionally well-suited to her learning profile. It allows her to work at her own pace (within deadlines), explore topics of high personal interest to maintain focus, and express her understanding visually, which plays to her strengths and bypasses challenges associated with dyslexia.

- **Content Breakdown:** To manage the large, open-ended nature of art projects, use a large A3 planner or a whiteboard to visually map out the project against the four Assessment Objectives. Break each project into small, distinct, and achievable tasks with clear deadlines. For example: 'Week 1: Brainstorm and mind map initial ideas for the "Transformation" theme.' 'Week 2: Research three relevant artists and create a digital mood board.' 'Week 3: Complete two experimental studies using different media.' This "chunking" approach provides the structure needed to manage ADHD-related difficulties with executive function and task initiation.
- **Engagement & Focus:** The key to maintaining Bessie's engagement is to directly link all project work to her passions. For a theme like "Identity" or "Transformation," she could explore the process of an actor transforming into a character through special effects make-up. For a theme like "Natural Forms," she could focus on the anatomy and movement of horses. Tapping into these areas of intense interest will activate her ability to hyperfocus, turning a school project into a passion project.
- **Resource Adaptation:** Instead of a traditional physical sketchbook, which can become disorganized, Bessie should use her laptop to create a digital portfolio (e.g., in PowerPoint, Google Slides, or OneNote). This allows her to easily organize her research, artist analysis, and photos of her practical work. Annotations, a key part of AO3, can be typed directly onto the slides, circumventing spelling difficulties. Furthermore, she can use voice-to-text software to dictate her thoughts and analysis, leveraging her strong verbal skills without the mechanical barrier of writing.
- **Active Learning Techniques:** Move beyond static artist research. Instead of just writing about an artist, Bessie should create "response pieces" in their style to actively understand their techniques. She can use visual tools like mind maps and storyboards to plan compositions, which aligns with visual learning preferences and helps organize ideas.4 To capture her thought process for AO3 (Record), she could create short "video diary" entries on her phone, verbally explaining her ideas and decisions.
- **Practice & Reinforcement:** The entire course is a process of practice and reinforcement. To build confidence, early projects in Year 10 should have very clear, scaffolded success criteria. Achieving these and receiving specific, positive praise will create a powerful feedback loop of success and motivation. The 10-hour "sustained focus" for the ESA can be demystified by practicing with smaller, timed tasks throughout the course (e.g., 'Complete a detailed tonal study in 2 hours').
- **Anxiety Management:** The 60% weighting of the Personal Portfolio provides a substantial safety net, reducing the pressure on the final ESA component.5 Frame the 10-hour ESA not as a stressful "exam," but as "dedicated studio time"—a special opportunity to bring her project to life without interruption. Regular, informal check-ins with her teacher can function as a designated "worry time," allowing her to discuss progress, troubleshoot problems, and manage any anxieties before they escalate.
- **Leveraging Strengths:** This subject is the ideal environment for Bessie's creativity to flourish. Her inquisitive nature will drive her research (AO1), and her caring personality can inform the themes she chooses to explore, perhaps focusing on animal welfare or environmental conservation.

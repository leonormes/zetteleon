- Curriculum Content: This double GCSE course covers key topics across Biology (cell biology, organization, infection/response, bioenergetics, homeostasis, inheritance, evolution, ecology), Chemistry (atomic structure, periodic table, bonding, quantitative chemistry, energy changes, reaction rates, organic chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, analysis), and Physics (energy, electricity, particle model, atomic structure, forces, waves, magnetism/electromagnetism). It involves externally assessed examinations with a minimum of 15% of marks from practical work questions.
- Alignment with Bessie's Profile:
  - Strengths: Bessie has previously shown intense interest in science-related topics, such as genetics and snake breeding, when taught engagingly. If the content is presented interactively and aligns with her interests, her hyperfocus could be a great asset.
  - Learning Needs: Science is one of the subjects where Bessie is supposed to receive blue paper, but it doesn't always happen. Her CAT4 scores indicate a slight preference for verbal over spatial learning, and she may perform at a slightly lower level in science, technology, design, and geography, which draw on spatial ability. The need for clear instructions, broken-down tasks, and reduced reliance on copying from the board are critical for her engagement and understanding. Her difficulties with concentration in noisy/sensory environments could also impact practical science lessons.

## **Subject Overview**

- **Qualification:** GCSE (9-1) Film Studies 9
- **Exam Board:** Eduqas (a branch of WJEC) 9
- **Key Topics:** The course is built around the analysis of key elements of film form, including cinematography, mise-en-scène, editing, and sound. Students also explore the contexts in which films are made (social, cultural, historical, political). Learning is anchored in the detailed study of a diverse range of set films, including US mainstream classics, US independent films, contemporary UK films, and global films in both English and other languages.9
- **Assessment:** The qualification is assessed through a combination of exams and coursework, providing a balanced structure.
- **Component 1: Key Developments in US Film (35%):** A 1-hour 30-minute written exam. This paper assesses knowledge of three set US films, focusing on comparative study, key developments in film technology, and US independent cinema.9
- **Component 2: Global Film: Narrative, Representation and Film Style (35%):** A 1-hour 30-minute written exam. This paper assesses knowledge of three set global films (one English language, one non-English language, and one contemporary UK film), focusing on narrative, representation, and aesthetics.9
- **Component 3: Production (30%):** This is the Non-Exam Assessment (NEA). Students must produce either a genre-based film extract (2-2.5 minutes) or a screenplay extract with an accompanying shooting script. This is submitted with a written evaluative analysis (750-850 words).9

## **Tailored Learning & Study Recommendations for Bessie**

Film Studies is an excellent subject choice for Bessie, acting as a bridge between her creative passions and the academic skills required in other humanities subjects. The source material (film) is highly engaging for a visual learner, and the course structure allows her to be both an analyst and a creator.

- **Content Breakdown:** The volume of information for each set film can be managed by using a consistent template for note-taking, printed on blue paper. The template should have clear headings: 'Plot Summary', 'Key Characters', 'Themes', 'Cinematography', 'Mise-en-scène', 'Editing', 'Sound', and 'Context'. Notes can be made in bullet points while watching clips, breaking the analysis into manageable chunks. For the NEA production, a professional storyboard template is essential for planning the film extract shot-by-shot, providing a visual and structured guide.4
- **Engagement & Focus:** Connect film analysis directly to her interests. When studying mise-en-scène, the focus can be on costume, hair, and make-up. How do these elements define a character or signify a film's genre? A highly engaging practical task would be for her to research and then recreate a specific character's make-up design, photographing the results and annotating how it contributes to characterisation. This links the curriculum to her career aspirations.
- **Resource Adaptation:** Use digital mind-mapping tools like Miro or Coggle to create visual webs of ideas for film analysis. Instead of drawing scenes, use screen-capture tools to grab key frames from films, which can then be inserted into her digital notes for annotation. All exam practice essays and the final evaluative analysis for the NEA must be completed on her laptop to accommodate her dyslexia. The school should provide printed copies of scripts for key scenes to support analysis, reducing reading fatigue from screens.
- **Active Learning Techniques:** Bessie's strong verbal skills are a major asset. Organise regular, structured small-group discussions or formal debates on topics like 'Which director is more effective at creating suspense?' or 'How is the theme of conflict represented differently in these two films?'.1 For revision, she can verbally "present" a detailed analysis of a film sequence to a family member, which reinforces learning through teaching. The NEA production itself is the ultimate active learning task, allowing her to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, creative context.
- **Practice & Reinforcement:** To prepare for the exams, focus on practicing short, timed paragraphs on a single film element (e.g., 'Analyse the use of sound in the opening of *Jaws*'). This builds writing stamina and confidence incrementally. The NEA's evaluative analysis should be heavily scaffolded with a clear structure, paragraph-by-paragraph guidance, and sentence starters to help her articulate her creative decisions.
- **Anxiety Management:** The 30% NEA component provides a significant creative outlet and a confidence-building buffer against the pressure of the two exams.9 For the exams themselves, teach her to use a system of colour-coded highlighters to deconstruct the questions. For example, highlight the film's title in yellow, the cinematic technique in pink, and the theme or effect in green. This makes complex questions less intimidating and provides a clear focus for her answer.1 Paired reading of critical articles or reviews can also reduce the pressure of solitary reading tasks.
- **Leveraging Strengths:** This course is perfectly suited to her inquisitive, creative, and verbal nature. It directly feeds her passion for film and provides a legitimate academic context for it. The opportunity to create her own screenplay or film extract is hugely empowering and will be a significant boost to her confidence and sense of ownership over her learning. The skills of analysis—examining narrative, character, theme, and context—are directly transferable to the study of novels in English and sources in History, making this a valuable "training ground" for core academic competencies.

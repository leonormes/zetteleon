title: Writing Acts as an External Working Memory

For individuals like Bessie who face working memory challenges, the act of writing can serve as a powerful external tool, effectively becoming an extension of the mind. By transferring thoughts, ideas, and tasks from transient working memory onto a stable medium like paper or a screen, cognitive resources are freed up.

This offloading process reduces the mental energy spent on simply holding information, allowing the brain to engage in deeper processing, analysis, and connection of ideas. The writer only needs to remember that the information has been captured, not the information itself.

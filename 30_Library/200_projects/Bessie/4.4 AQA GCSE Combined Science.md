## **Subject Overview**

- **Qualification:** GCSE (9-1) Combined Science: Trilogy. This qualification is equivalent to two GCSEs.25
- **Exam Board:** AQA 25
- **Key Topics:** The course covers foundational content from all three sciences, split into distinct topics 26:
  - **Biology:** Cell Biology, Organisation, Infection and Response, Bioenergetics, Homeostasis and Response, Inheritance and Evolution, Ecology.
  - **Chemistry:** Atomic Structure, Bonding, Quantitative Chemistry, Chemical Changes, Energy Changes, Rates of Reaction, Organic Chemistry, Chemical Analysis, Chemistry of the Atmosphere, Using Resources.
  - **Physics:** Energy, Electricity, Particle Model of Matter, Atomic Structure, Forces, Waves, Magnetism and Electromagnetism.
  - The course also includes 21 required practicals, skills from which are assessed in the written exams.25
- **Assessment:** The qualification is 100% assessed by six written exam papers. There are two papers for each science, each 1 hour and 15 minutes long and worth 70 marks. Each paper contributes 16.7% to the final grade.26
  - **Biology Paper 1:** Topics 1-4
  - **Biology Paper 2:** Topics 5-7
  - **Chemistry Paper 1:** Topics 8-12
  - **Chemistry Paper 2:** Topics 13-17
  - **Physics Paper 1:** Topics 18-21
  - **Physics Paper 2:** Topics 22-24

## **Tailored Learning & Study Recommendations for Bessie**

Combined Science has a vast amount of content, terminology, and mathematical application. The primary challenges for Bessie will be the memory load, the multi-step problem-solving, and the spatial aspects of some physics and biology diagrams. Her strengths in knowing facts about animals and her inquisitive nature are excellent starting points.

- **Content Breakdown:** Use knowledge organisers for every single topic. These one-page summaries (printed on blue paper) should contain key definitions, diagrams, formulae, and required practical summaries. This chunks the content into a manageable, visual format. For revision, use a topic checklist and the "Pomodoro Technique" to work through one small section at a time.4
- **Engagement & Focus:** Link the science to her interests.
  - **Biology:** Her knowledge of animals is a huge advantage. Topics like inheritance, evolution, ecology, and homeostasis can all be explored through the lens of horses or other animals she knows well.
  - **Chemistry:** Link chemical changes to practical applications in special effects, like creating smoke or colour changes.
  - **Physics:** The topic of forces can be related to the physics of horse jumping. The topic of waves can be linked to sound and light in film.
- **Resource Adaptation:** Provide all worksheets and notes on blue paper. Use online resources like BBC Bitesize and Seneca Learning, which offer interactive, chunked content with quizzes. For diagrams (e.g., the heart, an electrical circuit), use simplified, colour-coded versions. Use 3D models where possible to overcome difficulties with 2D representations. For mathematical equations, have a dedicated, clearly written formula sheet that she can use for all classwork and homework.
- **Active Learning Techniques:** Create large, visual mind maps to connect concepts within a topic. Use physical models (e.g., Molymod for chemistry, play-doh for cells) to create concrete representations of abstract ideas. For the required practicals, she should use a structured worksheet with a pictorial checklist of the steps to follow.1 She could create short videos explaining a practical method, using her verbal skills.
- **Practice & Reinforcement:** Regular, low-stakes quizzing is essential for memory retention. Use flashcards for key definitions and formulae. For the mathematical questions, practice the steps repeatedly until they become a familiar process. Build confidence by starting with single-step calculations before moving to more complex problems.
- **Anxiety Management:** The six separate, shorter exam papers can be less intimidating than fewer, longer ones.26 A clear revision plan that breaks down the vast content into small, daily goals is the best way to prevent feeling overwhelmed. During exams, encourage her to tackle the multiple-choice and short-answer questions first to build confidence and secure marks before moving to the longer, more complex questions.
- **Leveraging Strengths:** Her factual knowledge about animals can be a springboard for many biology topics. Her inquisitive nature should be encouraged—asking "why" and "how" is the heart of scientific thinking. Her creativity can be used to create memorable mnemonics or visual aids for revision. Her verbal skills can be used to explain a scientific concept clearly, which is a great way to check for understanding.

## **Subject Overview**

- **Qualification:** GCSE (9-1) History 11
- **Exam Board:** [[Edexcel]] 11
- **Key Topics:** The [[Edexcel]] specification is structured around three papers, covering a wide range of historical periods and regions. Schools select one option for each paper. A typical combination might be:
  - **Paper 1 (Thematic Study):** *Medicine in Britain, c1250–present* with a linked *Historic Environment* study on *The British sector of the Western Front, 1914–18: injuries, treatment and the trenches*. This option tracks change and continuity over a long period.11
  - **Paper 2 (Period & British Depth Study):** A Period Study such as *Superpower relations and the Cold War, 1941–91* combined with a British Depth Study like *Early Elizabethan England, 1558–88*.11
  - **Paper 3 (Modern Depth Study):** *Weimar and Nazi Germany, 1918–39*.11
- **Assessment:** The course is 100% externally assessed through three written examinations.
  - **Paper 1: Thematic study and historic environment (30%):** 1-hour 20-minute exam. Assesses knowledge, analysis of change over time, and use of historical sources.11
  - **Paper 2: Period study and British depth study (40%):** 1-hour 50-minute exam. Assesses knowledge and understanding of two distinct historical periods, focusing on concepts like consequence and causation.11
  - **Paper 3: Modern depth study (30%):** 1-hour 30-minute exam. Assesses knowledge, use of sources, and the analysis of historical interpretations (how and why historians differ).11

## **Tailored Learning & Study Recommendations for Bessie**

History is one of Bessie's favourite subjects, and her inquisitive nature and interest in facts are significant strengths. The main challenges will be the high volume of content to remember, the literacy-heavy nature of the exams, and her lower spatial ability with maps and diagrams. Strategies must focus on making the content memorable, accessible, and manageable.

- **Content Breakdown:** Each topic must be broken down into a series of key questions. For example, for *Medicine in Britain*, a sub-topic could be 'What was the impact of the Black Death?'. Use visual timelines as the backbone for each topic, plotting key events, individuals, and dates. This provides a clear, chronological structure. The "Pomodoro Technique" (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break) will be essential for revision sessions to maintain concentration.4
- **Engagement & Focus:** Connect historical topics to her interests. The *Medicine in Britain* topic has direct links to special effects, for example, in understanding historical diseases and injuries. The study of the Western Front can involve looking at photographs and film footage, linking to her other subjects. Her love of animals can be a hook; for example, exploring the role of horses in warfare or society during the periods she studies.
- **Resource Adaptation:** All resources must be provided in printed format on blue paper. Use a laptop for all note-taking and essay practice. Create digital flashcards using apps like Quizlet or Anki, which use spaced repetition to aid memory. These can include images as well as text. For source analysis, sources should be enlarged and presented with ample space for typed annotations. Instead of copying notes, she should be provided with pre-prepared summary sheets (on blue paper) which she can then highlight and annotate.
- **Active Learning Techniques:** History is about stories. Encourage Bessie to use her verbal skills to retell historical events as if she were a news reporter or a character from the time. Create large, colourful mind maps to link causes, events, and consequences, using images and symbols instead of just words.4 For source analysis, use a simple, memorable acronym like 'COPS' (Content, Origin, Purpose, Style) to structure her thinking. For the interpretations questions in Paper 3, she could role-play a debate between the two historians.
- **Practice & Reinforcement:** The sheer volume of content requires consistent reinforcement. Start each lesson with a short, low-stakes quiz on the previous lesson's content. Build essay-writing skills by scaffolding paragraphs. Provide clear paragraph structures and sentence starters (e.g., 'One reason for... was...', 'This was significant because...', 'A consequence of this was...'). This builds confidence and automates the writing process, freeing up cognitive energy to focus on the historical detail.
- **Anxiety Management:** The 100% exam structure can be daunting. Break down revision into very small, manageable chunks to avoid overwhelm. A visual revision timetable is essential. Practice exam questions under timed conditions, but start with shorter timings (e.g., 10 minutes for a 4-mark question) and gradually build up. This desensitises her to the time pressure. Explicitly teach exam command words (e.g., 'Describe', 'Explain', 'Evaluate') so she knows exactly what each question is asking of her.
- **Leveraging Strengths:** Her inquisitive nature and love of facts are perfect for a historian. Encourage her to ask 'why' and to dig deeper into the stories behind the events. Her strong verbal ability can be used to articulate complex arguments in class discussions and debates, which will help embed her understanding before she has to write it down.

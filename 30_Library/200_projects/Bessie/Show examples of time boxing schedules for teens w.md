Here are examples of time boxing schedules designed for teens with ADHD. Time boxing helps by setting a specific start and stop time for each task, including important breaks, keeping the day manageable and motivating.[^1][^2][^3]

## Example 1: School Day with Breaks

| Time        | Activity                 | Time Box Length |
| :---------- | :----------------------- | :-------------- |
| 8:00–8:30   | Morning routine          | 30 min          |
| 8:30–9:00   | Maths homework           | 30 min          |
| 9:00–9:10   | Short break (walk/snack) | 10 min          |
| 9:10–9:40   | Reading/English          | 30 min          |
| 9:40–10:00  | Science project          | 20 min          |
| 10:00–10:15 | Free time/stretch        | 15 min          |
| 10:15–10:45 | Art or creative hobby    | 30 min          |
| 10:45–11:00 | Review day’s work        | 15 min          |

## Example 2: Flexibility and Self-Care

| Time      | Activity                 | Time Box Length |
| :-------- | :----------------------- | :-------------- |
| 2:00–2:20 | Social studies           | 20 min          |
| 2:20–2:30 | Short break (game/video) | 10 min          |
| 2:30–3:00 | Science experiment       | 30 min          |
| 3:00–3:15 | Snack and movement       | 15 min          |
| 3:15–3:45 | Finish homework/tasks    | 30 min          |
| 3:45–4:00 | Chill time               | 15 min          |

## How to Use These Schedules

- Use a timer or an app to keep track of each box—when the time’s up, move on, even if not totally finished.[^2][^3][^1]
- If something feels hard to start, set a shorter time box (even 10 minutes) to get moving.
- Add in fun activities, snack breaks, walks, or music between focus sessions—breaks are key for energy and motivation with ADHD.[^1][^2]

## Tips for Success

- Adjust box times to fit mood and energy: longer for favorite subjects, shorter for tricky ones.
- Review how the day went—make tomorrow’s schedule with lessons learned from today.[^3][^2]
- Tools like visual planners or color-coded calendars can make the routine clearer and more engaging.[^4][^5]

These examples can be mixed and matched based on schoolwork, hobbies, and personal routines—time boxing is about making the schedule fit the way the ADHD brain works best.[^2][^3][^1]

Can You Explain to My Daughter Who is 13 what time Blocking is and what time Boxing is and what the Difference Is. I Think Her ADHD Brain Would Work Better with time Boxing

Time blocking and time boxing are both ways to organize your day and control your schedule, but they work a little differently. Here’s an explanation for a 13-year-old, especially if ADHD makes it tough to focus for long stretches or switch tasks smoothly.

### What is Time Blocking

Time blocking means dividing your day into big chunks or “blocks” and deciding what you’ll do in each block ahead of time. For example, you might block out 10:00–11:00 for maths, 11:00–11:30 for reading, 11:30–12:00 for a break, and so on—like making a simple schedule. The main idea is each block is set for a certain type of activity rather than a specific task. You stay focused on that general type of work, but if you don’t finish everything you wanted, you just move to the next block.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

### What is Time Boxing

Time boxing is about giving each task a set amount of time—like putting each job in its own box with a time limit. For example: “I’ll spend 30 minutes on my science homework at 2:00 pm, then I’m done—whether I finish it or not.” You set the timer and only work on that one thing; when time’s up, you stop and can take a break or start something new. It helps you start things that feel hard and keeps you from spending too long on one task.[^5][^6][^7]

### What is the Difference

|                  | Time Blocking                                    | Time Boxing                               |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| What it is       | Block out chunks for activities                  | Give each task a set time limit           |
| How it works     | Focus on a category (like “study time”)          | Focus on a specific job for exact minutes |
| If time runs out | Move to next block—even if task isn’t finished   | Move to next box—stop when the timer ends |
| Good for ADHD    | Can work for routine, but doesn’t force stopping | Helps you start tasks and not get “stuck” |

Time boxing is usually better for ADHD brains because it uses specific limits to keep from getting distracted or spending forever on one thing. It creates a healthy habit of starting tasks right away and moving on when the time’s up, so you have energy for everything you want to do.[^6][^7][^5]

It is a significant and commendable decision to create a home curriculum for Bessie, particularly given her unique learning profile and past school experiences. Your goal to maximize her potential as a learner and prepare her for life is perfectly aligned with evidence-based strategies for neurodivergent individuals. As your thought partner, I will help structure this curriculum by drawing on the "Learn Like a Pro" and "ADHD 2.0" sources, along with other relevant information about Bessie, to ensure it is comprehensive, personalized, and effective.

The curriculum should be built upon several foundational principles that cater to Bessie's specific needs and leverage her strengths:

## Foundational Principles for Bessie's Home Curriculum

1. **Strength-Based Model and Positive Mindset:**
   - **"Race Car Brain with Bicycle Brakes" Analogy:** This non-shaming approach helps children with ADHD understand their brain as a powerful asset that simply needs work on "brakes" (self-regulation). Help Bessie understand that her intense focus when interested is a superpower, and the goal is to direct that power more effectively.
   - **Focus on Strengths:** Bessie is inquisitive, caring, thoughtful, and highly creative, with passions for Art, History, Film, and horses. Her verbal skills are also a major asset. The curriculum should *start* with these strengths, positioning them as "anchor" subjects or activities where she feels confident and in control.
   - **Positive Reinforcement:** Consistently adopt a "You can do it" approach. Praise effort, logical thinking, and perseverance, not just correctness. This fosters a growth mindset and builds confidence.
   - **Human Connection and Warmth:** Ensure a learning environment filled with love, encouragement, and active listening. This counters negative experiences and builds trust.

2. **Low-Fear, High-Trust Learning Environment:**
   - **Safety and Psychological Security:** Given Bessie's anxiety, occasional self-harm, and past negative experiences at school, a home environment should be a safe sanctuary. Shaming is strictly prohibited. Frame mistakes as "detective work" to find where the process went astray, reducing the fear of being wrong.
   - **Clear Expectations and Structure:** While flexible, clear rules and routines help manage ADHD-related difficulties with executive function. Predictability reduces anxiety.

3. **Metacognitive and Self-Regulated Learning (Learn Like a Pro Model):**
   - **Four-Step Model:** This recursive process helps students become more self-regulated learners, moving them from the 50th to the 75th percentile.
     - **Step 1: Understand the Task:** Clearly define what is required, how success will be assessed, and available resources. If Bessie doesn't know where to start, it's a sign she hasn't understood the task well.
     - **Step 2: Set Goals and Plan:** Help Bessie set clear, achievable goals. Break down tasks into small, manageable chunks. Use visual planners or whiteboards.
     - **Step 3: Enact Strategies:** Implement active and personalized learning strategies (detailed below).
     - **Step 4: Evaluate Performance and Adjust:** Regularly review what worked, what didn't, and why. Use a structured form to reflect on learning experiences. This will help refine her approach and achieve better outcomes.

## Core Curriculum Design for Bessie

The curriculum should be designed as a "single, coherent project" by actively looking for inter-subject connections, which is a key strength for Bessie's "big picture" brain.

### I. Harnessing Inter-Subject Connections: The "Big Picture" Brain

- **Art, History, and Film:** These are intrinsically linked. A History topic (e.g., *Weimar and Nazi Germany*) can inform Film Studies (German Expressionist cinema) and Art/Photography (creating a portfolio piece using the visual style of *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari* to explore modern anxieties).
- **English and Philosophy & Ethics:** Novels (e.g., *An Inspector Calls*, *A Christmas Carol*) can be grounds for exploring ethical dilemmas. Debates in Philosophy can be supported by examples from English Literature.
- **Science and Art/Photography:** Biology (anatomy, animal movement) is fundamental to life drawing and photographing horses. Physics (optics, waves) is the foundation of photography. Chemistry (pigments, emulsions) explains art/photo processes. Projects could involve photographing chemical reactions or microscope patterns for art.
- **Mathematics and Art/English/Film Studies:** Ratio, proportion, and geometry are central to composition in Art/Photography (e.g., Golden Ratio). Poetry rhythm and meter can be analyzed mathematically. Logical structure in English essays parallels mathematical proofs. For Film Studies, special effects apply Chemistry (latex, fake blood) and Physics (mechanics, pyrotechnics). Financial aspects of filmmaking (budgets, box office) provide real-world data for Maths/Statistics.

### II. Compulsory Subjects: Building Core Skills and Confidence

1. **English Language:**
   - **Challenges:** Reliance on unseen texts, timed conditions, spelling, grammar. Dyslexia and phonological processing difficulties.
   - **Strategies:**
     - **Text-to-Speech:** Use software to read unseen texts aloud to bypass phonological processing difficulties.
     - **Laptop Use:** All writing tasks to be completed on a laptop with grammar and spell-check enabled for immediate feedback and reduced anxiety.
     - **Formulaic Approach:** Provide step-by-step structures for each question type (e.g., PEE for language analysis, comparative structure for Paper 2 comparison) to reduce cognitive load.
     - **"Sensory Bank":** Pre-load vocabulary and ideas for creative writing by building a bank of words and phrases related to different settings.
     - **Paired Reading:** Reduce reading fatigue by reading texts collaboratively.
     - **Verbal Processing:** Encourage her to verbally "talk through" her analysis before writing.
     - **Link to Interests:** For creative writing, she can describe a film set or horse show. For spoken language, she can present on special effects makeup or horse riding.
   - **Life Skills:** This subject develops critical reading and writing skills essential for any career.

2. **English Literature:**
   - **Challenges:** Memory load for closed-book exams, archaic language.
   - **Strategies:**
     - **Film/Stage Adaptations:** Use adaptations (e.g., *Macbeth*) as a gateway to texts to provide context and make language less intimidating.
     - **Audiobooks:** Listen to texts while following along in dyslexia-friendly versions to reinforce learning through multiple senses.
     - **Key Quotes:** Focus on memorizing 15-20 powerful quotes per text using flashcards (blue card) with bullet-point analysis. Use "look, cover, write, check" method.
     - **Active Learning:** Create character maps, relationship webs. Hot-seat characters (role-play). For poetry, create visual collages or short films.
     - **Verbal Processing:** Use verbal discussions to understand character motivations and themes deeply.

3. **Mathematics:**
   - **Challenges:** Maths anxiety, working memory, sequencing, lower spatial ability (making Geometry difficult).
   - **Strategies:**
     - **Break Down Skills:** Each topic should be broken into its smallest component skills on a checklist (e.g., "Solving one-step equations," "Solving two-step equations") to build a sense of accomplishment.
     - **Relate to Interests:** Make abstract concepts concrete by linking to her passions: calculate ingredient mixtures for SFX, analyze perspective in art, track film box office data, analyze horse performance statistics.
     - **Manipulatives & Visuals:** Use physical tools (number line, algebra tiles, 3D shapes) for concrete experiences. Large, colourful posters or mind maps for formulae, with mnemonics.
     - **Online Platforms:** Use resources like Corbettmaths for chunked video tutorials and quizzes.
     - **"Teach Back" Method:** Bessie should "teach" concepts back to you or a peer, reinforcing understanding and using verbal strengths.
     - **"Little and Often" Practice:** Short, daily practice (15-20 minutes) is more effective than long sessions. Start with Number (her strength) to build confidence.
     - **Address Anxiety:** Create a "traffic light" system on her topic checklist to communicate understanding. Frame mistakes as "detective work". Ask questions to uncover her specific fears about failure.

4. **Science (Combined Science):**
   - **Challenges:** Vast content, terminology, multi-step problem-solving, spatial aspects of diagrams.
   - **Strategies:**
     - **Knowledge Organisers:** Use one-page summaries (on blue paper) with definitions, diagrams, formulae, practical summaries.
     - **Link to Interests:** Explore biology through animals (horses, wolf dogs), chemistry for SFX (smoke, color changes), physics for horse jumping or sound/light in film.
     - **Online Resources:** Utilize BBC Bitesize and Seneca Learning for interactive, chunked content.
     - **Visual Aids:** Use simplified, color-coded diagrams and 3D models to overcome difficulties with 2D representations. Create mind maps to connect concepts.
     - **Verbal Explanation:** Encourage her to explain scientific concepts clearly to check for understanding.

## Specific Learning Support Strategies

Beyond subject-specific strategies, the following general approaches are crucial:

1. **Reduce Cognitive Load and Manage Distractions:**
   - **Break Down Tasks:** All large tasks should be broken down into achievable chunks, reflecting her need for structured learning.
   - **Minimize Copying:** Avoid copying large chunks of information from a board; provide printed materials (on blue paper where possible) or PowerPoints instead.
   - **Working Memory Support:** Use external aids like checklists, knowledge organizers, and visual prompts.

2. **Multi-Sensory and Active Learning:**
   - **Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic:** Incorporate a variety of methods: visual aids (mind maps, diagrams, videos), audio (audiobooks, music during tasks), and kinesthetic (physical models, hands-on projects, movement).
   - **Inquiry-Based Learning:** Encourage her inquisitive nature by asking "why" and "what if," and engaging in hypothesis formation and testing.
   - **Project-Based Learning:** As much as possible, structure learning around projects that allow for innovation and initiative.

3. **Technology Integration:**
   - **Laptop for Writing:** Essential for all extended writing tasks to accommodate dyslexia and provide spell/grammar check.
   - **Digital Tools:** Utilize mind-mapping software, digital flashcards, screen-capture tools, and visual editing software.

4. **Managing Anxiety and Maintaining Focus:**
   - **Structured Breaks and Movement:** Integrate frequent, planned breaks. This could include jumping rope before a difficult math session, as successfully used by Lucy. Even short bursts of exercise can improve focus.
   - **"Time-Out" Equivalent:** Create a designated quiet space or "cubby" at home where Bessie can go to self-regulate when feeling overwhelmed. Allow her to use music to help her calm down.
   - **Pre-arranged "Worry Time":** Dedicate specific times to discuss anxieties about tasks or progress, preventing them from escalating during learning.
   - **Visual Timetables and Checklists:** Provide clear, visual schedules to help with organization and transitions, reducing overwhelm.

5. **Problem-Solving Skills:**
   - Teach a systematic problem-solving approach: (1) Identify the problem, (2) Brainstorm solutions, (3) Evaluate consequences (short-term, long-term, practicality), (4) Choose the best solution, (5) Implement and review.
   - Encourage "one-off experiments" to test anxious predictions.

## Preparing for Life Beyond Academics

1. **Career Pathway Focus:**
   - **Special Effects Make-up Artist:** Bessie's aspiration should be explicitly woven into the curriculum. Explore how Chemistry, Physics, Art, Photography, and Film Studies directly contribute to this career goal.
   - **Real-World Connections:** Apply academic concepts to practical, real-world scenarios related to her interests.

2. **Life Skills Education:**
   - **Financial Literacy:** Integrate financial planning and budgeting into Maths (e.g., film budgets, box office returns, managing her own finances).
   - **Self-Advocacy:** Empower her to understand her own learning profile and articulate her needs confidently. This will be vital for future education or employment.
   - **Independence:** Foster independent study skills, time management, and the ability to organize her own learning.

3. **Social and Emotional Well-being:**
   - **Validation and Open Communication:** Continue the supportive home environment where she feels safe to express difficulties, including self-harm concerns, without judgment.
   - **Coping Strategies:** Continue to develop and practice alternative coping strategies for intense emotions (e.g., music, drawing, movement).
   - **Social Connections:** While home-schooled, actively seek out opportunities for social interaction with trusted friends or in interest-based groups (e.g., equestrian activities, film clubs, Dungeons and Dragons club which she enjoys).

## Your Role as a Parent-Educator

You are in a unique position to help Bessie overcome her fears and worries. Your role is to be a coach and cheerleader, not to solve problems for her, but to guide her in finding her own solutions.

- **Model Managing Fears:** Be aware of your own responses to challenges and model healthy coping mechanisms.
- **Praise Effort and "Having a Go":** Focus praise on the effort she makes and her willingness to try, especially when feeling anxious, rather than solely on the outcome.
- **Collaborative Approach:** Work *with* Bessie to set goals and plans. This fosters a sense of ownership over her learning.
- **Self-Care:** Acknowledge the emotional toll of this journey and actively seek support for yourself. Your well-being is essential for effectively supporting Bessie.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Collaborative Vision Session with Bessie:** Sit down with Bessie and involve her in setting the initial goals for her home curriculum. Use questions like "What would you like to achieve?" and "What makes you feel excited to learn?". This will give her a sense of ownership.
2. **Develop a "Learning Passport" for Home:** Create a personalized, student-friendly summary of her key learning strategies and accommodations for the home environment. This empowers her to take ownership and advocate for her own needs, even at home.
3. **Establish a Regular Review Cycle:** Agree on a schedule for regular check-ins with Bessie to monitor which strategies are working, adjust those that are not, celebrate successes, and proactively address any new challenges or anxieties. This dynamic process will ensure the curriculum remains responsive to her evolving needs.

By implementing these tailored strategies, your home curriculum can provide Bessie with an empowering and positive learning experience, allowing her unique talents to flourish and preparing her to confidently pursue her future aspirations.

Your next step could be to discuss these foundational principles and subject-specific strategies with Bessie, perhaps by showing her examples of how her interests can be woven into each subject. This could ignite her enthusiasm for this new learning chapter.

The 'Assess' stage involves gathering comprehensive and holistic information about Bessie's learning profile, which should be an ongoing process.

## Current Assessment Insights

- **Diagnoses**: Bessie has confirmed diagnoses of ADHD and dyslexia-related needs, alongside anxiety.
- **Academic Challenges**: She experiences particular difficulties with reading speed and information processing.
- **Learning Gaps/Barriers**: These include Mearles Irlen syndrome, requiring resources printed on blue paper, and exam dispensation needs.
- **Strengths**: Bessie is described as inquisitive, caring, thoughtful, and highly creative, with passions for Art, History, Film, and horses.
- **Emotional & Behavioral Impact**: Her anxiety leads to feeling overwhelmed, often resorting to using a time-out pass to a quieter room.

## Evidence-Based Assessment Framework

### ADHD Assessment Insights

- [[Adhd 2.0]] - Understanding Task-Positive Network (TPN) vs Default Mode Network (DMN) patterns: "What three or four things are you best at doing? What three or four things do you like doing the most?"
- [[Solving the Procrastination Puzzle]] - Assessing executive function patterns and self-deception tendencies

### Learning Strategy Assessment

- [[Learn Like a Pro]] - Evaluating current study habits and identifying areas for process-focused improvements
- [[I learned a system for remembering everything]] - Assessing note-taking and information retention methods

### Systemic Context

- [['I've been fighting for so long' More than half of special needs plans delayed]] - Understanding the broader challenges facing SEND families and ensuring Bessie's assessment doesn't get delayed

## Character Development Assessment

Beyond academic and learning needs, assessment should include character strengths from the [[Character and Virtue MOC]]:

**Current Character Strengths Evident:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Wisdom]]**: Curiosity, love of learning, creativity (evident in her inquisitive nature and diverse interests)
- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage]]**: Bravery, perseverance, zest (shown in her willingness to "have a go" despite challenges)
- **[[VIA Virtue of Humanity]]**: Social intelligence (demonstrated through strong verbal and discussion skills)
- **[[VIA Virtue of Transcendence]]**: Appreciation of beauty, hope (reflected in her artistic passions and career aspirations)

**Assessment Questions for Character Development:**

- How does Bessie demonstrate curiosity and love of learning across different contexts?
- What situations bring out her natural leadership and social intelligence?
- How can her creative strengths be channeled to develop other character virtues?
- What character strengths emerge when she feels safe and supported?

## Recommendation for Assessment Continuity

- **Regular Data Gathering**: Continue to gather information from various sources, including parents/guardians, outside agencies, academy data, teachers, and pastoral staff.
- **In-depth Student Voice**: Regularly conduct detailed check-ins with Bessie to understand her day-to-day experience and the effectiveness of support strategies, using questions that probe specific classroom experiences and emotional well-being.
- **Teacher Feedback Loop**: Ensure consistent and structured feedback from all teachers on how Bessie's specific needs manifest in their lessons and the efficacy of implemented strategies.
- **Character Strengths Observation**: Include regular assessment of how Bessie's character strengths are developing alongside academic progress.

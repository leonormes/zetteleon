- Curriculum Content: Students explore various mediums and materials (Fine Art, Print Making, Textiles), research artists, and combine their styles with personal ideas to create artwork. It is assessed through an internal portfolio (60%) and an externally controlled assessment (40%).
- Alignment with Bessie's Profile:
  - Strengths: Bessie explicitly states she likes art the most and is described as very creative. This subject directly plays to her strengths and creativity, and her enjoyment could lead to hyperfocus and deep engagement. This course is a strong fit for her interests and learning style.
  - Learning Needs: The project-based nature of assessment might be less impacted by her writing difficulties, as it involves visual portfolios. However, documenting creative process and research will still require written work, where laptop use and blue paper would be helpful. The potential for hands-on work might also reduce the reliance on copying from the board.

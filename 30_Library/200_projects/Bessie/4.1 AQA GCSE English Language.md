## **Subject Overview**

- **Qualification:** GCSE (9-1) English Language 16
- **Exam Board:** AQA 18
- **Key Topics:** The course is skills-based and untiered, meaning all students sit the same papers. It focuses on developing the ability to analyse unseen texts and write for a variety of purposes.
  - **Paper 1: Explorations in Creative Reading and Writing:** Students analyse an unseen 20th or 21st-century literary fiction extract and produce a piece of descriptive or narrative writing.16
  - **Paper 2: Writers' Viewpoints and Perspectives:** Students analyse two unseen non-fiction texts (one 19th century, one 20th/21st century) that are linked by a common theme. They compare the writers' perspectives and methods, and then write to present their own viewpoint.16
  - **Non-exam Assessment: Spoken Language:** Students deliver a formal presentation on a topic of their choice. This is assessed by the teacher and awarded a separate grade (Pass, Merit, Distinction) which does not affect the 9-1 grade.20
- **Assessment:** 100% written examination for the 9-1 grade.
  - **Paper 1 (50%):** 1-hour 45-minute exam with a reading section (40 marks) and a writing section (40 marks).19
  - **Paper 2 (50%):** 1-hour 45-minute exam with a reading section (40 marks) and a writing section (40 marks).19
  - Spelling, punctuation, and grammar are assessed in the writing sections of both papers.

## **Tailored Learning & Study Recommendations for Bessie**

English Language presents a significant challenge due to its reliance on reading unseen texts under timed conditions and the high demands on spelling and grammar. However, Bessie's strengths in creative writing, verbal ability, and discussion can be powerful tools for success.

- **Content Breakdown:** Break down each exam paper question by question. Create a formulaic, step-by-step approach for each question type. For example, for Paper 1, Question 2 (language analysis), use the 'PEE' (Point, Evidence, Explain) structure. For Paper 2, Question 4 (comparison), use a comparative structure ('Both texts discuss X, however Text A presents it as... whereas Text B views it as...'). These structures act as cognitive scaffolding, reducing the mental load of planning an answer from scratch.8
- **Engagement & Focus:** For the creative writing task in Paper 1, Bessie should draw on her passions. If the prompt is to describe a busy place, she could describe the organised chaos behind the scenes of a film set or the energy of a horse show. For the Spoken Language assessment, she should choose a topic she is passionate about, such as "The artistry of special effects make-up" or "Why horse riding should be an Olympic sport." This will make the task enjoyable and allow her natural enthusiasm to shine.
- **Resource Adaptation:** All practice texts must be printed on blue paper and be well-spaced. Use text-to-speech software to have the unseen extracts read aloud to her during practice. This helps with comprehension and bypasses phonological processing difficulties, allowing her to focus on the analysis.4 Use a laptop with grammar and spell-check tools enabled for all writing practice. This provides immediate feedback and reduces anxiety about technical accuracy.
- **Active Learning Techniques:** Use highlighters to physically deconstruct texts. For example, highlight language features in one colour, structural features in another. To prepare for the writing tasks, create a "sensory bank" of words and phrases related to different settings (e.g., for a forest: 'dappled light', 'crunch of leaves', 'scent of pine'). This pre-loads vocabulary and ideas. Paired reading of texts, where she reads a paragraph and her partner reads the next, can reduce the fatigue of reading long extracts alone.
- **Practice & Reinforcement:** Focus on quality over quantity. It is better to write one excellent analytical paragraph and receive detailed feedback than to struggle through a whole paper. The writing tasks are where Bessie can excel. Encourage her to write short stories or descriptive pieces for pleasure, building her fluency and confidence. Praise her creativity and sophisticated vocabulary in these tasks.
- **Anxiety Management:** The "unseen" nature of the exam is a major anxiety trigger. Demystify this by practicing with a wide variety of short extracts from different genres and eras. This builds familiarity and shows that the skills are transferable. The formulaic approach to each question provides a predictable routine to follow in the exam, which is calming under pressure.2 The Spoken Language assessment should be framed as a chance to share her passion, not a test. She can practice it with family first to build confidence.
- **Leveraging Strengths:** Her strong verbal skills are key. She should verballly "talk through" her analysis of a text before writing it down. This helps to structure her thoughts. Her creativity is a huge asset for the writing sections, which are worth 50% of the entire qualification.20 A high mark on the writing can balance out a lower mark on the reading. Her inquisitive nature can be channelled into asking critical questions about the writers' perspectives in Paper 2\.

- Curriculum Content: The course explores US film (mainstream and independent), global cinema (English and non-English language), and contemporary UK film, focusing on genre, narrative, representation, style, cinematography, mise-en-scène, editing, and sound. It includes a practical production component (screenplay or film sequence with evaluative analysis).
- Alignment with Bessie's Profile:
  - Strengths: This subject aligns perfectly with Bessie's aspiration to be a special effect make-up artist for films and her current interest in this area. She also enjoys creative activities like playing computer games and is described as "off the scale talented" in special effects make-up. Her strong visual discrimination skills could be very beneficial for analyzing visual aspects of film. This subject is chosen by Bessie and plays to her strengths and creativity, making it likely she will benefit from it.
  - Learning Needs: While the subject is creative, it requires analytical writing and deconstruction of films for exams. Similar to English, accommodations for reading and writing (blue paper, laptop) will be important. The practical component might allow for less reliance on copying from the board and more hands-on, engaging work, which suits her learning style.

Effective note-taking is an active learning process, not a passive act of transcription. It compels the brain to engage with the material, extract its essential meaning, and organize it into a logical structure.

This active processing is crucial for building robust, interconnected links in long-term memory. Techniques such as "split notes" or visual "concept mapping" provide a framework for capturing and relating information, which aligns well with visual learning styles and helps to build strong mental schemas.

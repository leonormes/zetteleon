## How Container Filesystem Works: Building a Docker-like Container From Scratch

Clipped from: <https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/container-filesystem-from-scratch>

One of the superpowers of containers is their isolated filesystem view \- from inside a container it can look like a full Linux distro, often different from the host. Run `docker run nginx`, and Nginx lands in its familiar Debian userspace no matter what Linux flavor your host runs. But how is that illusion built?

In this post, we'll assemble a tiny but realistic, Docker-like container using only stock Linux tools: `unshare`, `mount`, and `pivot_root`. No runtime magic and (almost) no cut corners. Along the way, you'll see why the mount namespace is the bedrock of container isolation, while other namespaces, such as PID, cgroup, UTS, and even network, play rather complementary roles.

By the end - especially if you pair this with the [container networking tutorial](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/container-networking-from-scratch) \- you'll be able to spin up fully featured, Docker-style containers using nothing but standard Linux commands. The ultimate goal of every aspiring container guru.

### Prerequisites

- Some prior familiarity with Docker (or Podman, or the like) containers
- Basic Linux knowledge (shell scripting, general namespace awareness)
- Filesystem fundamentals (single directory hierarchy, mount table, bind mount, etc.)

### Visualizing the End Result

The diagram below shows what filesystem isolation looks like when Docker creates a new container. It's all right if the drawing feels overwhelming. With the help of the hands-on exercises in this tutorial, we'll build a comprehensive mental model of how containers work, so when we revisit the diagram in the closing section, it'll look much more digestible.

![Container rootfs isolation is a collective work of several namespaces simultaneously: mount, PID, cgroup, UTS, and network (with the mount namespace laying the foundation).](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/container-filesystem-from-scratch/__static__/container-rootfs-full-rev2.png)

### What Exactly Does Mount Namespace Isolate?

Let's do a quick experiment. In Terminal 1, start a new shell session in its own mount namespace:

```
sudo unshare --mount bash

```

Now in Terminal 2, create a file somewhere on the host's filesystem:

```
echo "Hello from host's mount namespace" | sudo tee /opt/marker.txt

```

Surprisingly or not, when you try locating this file in the newly created mount namespace using the Terminal 1 tab, it'll be there:

So what exactly did we just isolate with `unshare --mount`? 🤔

The answer is - a mount table. Here is how to verify it. From Terminal 1, mount something:

```
sudo mount --bind /tmp /mnt

```

💡 The above command uses a [bind mount](https://labs.iximiuz.com/challenges/storage-bind-mount) for simplicity, but a [regular mount](https://labs.iximiuz.com/challenges/storage-simple-mount) (of a block device) would do, too.

Now if you list the contents of the `/mnt` folder in Terminal 1, you should see the files of the `/tmp` folder:

```
total 12
drwx------ 3 root root 4096 Sep 11 14:16 file1
drwx------ 3 root root 4096 Sep 11 14:16 file2
...

```

But at the same time, the `/mnt` folder remained empty in the host mount namespace. If you run the same `ls` command from Terminal 2, you'll see no files:

Finally, the filesystem "views" started diverging between namespaces. However, we could only achieve it by creating a new mount point.

![Linux mount namespaces isolate the list of mount points (mount table) seen by the processes in each namespace.](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/container-filesystem-from-scratch/__static__/mount-namespaces.png)

_Mount namespaces, visualized_

From [the mount namespace man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html):

> Mount namespaces provide isolation of the list of mounts seen by the processes in each namespace instance. Thus, the processes in each of the mount namespace instances will see distinct single directory hierarchies.

Compare the mount tables by running `findmnt` from Terminal 1 and Terminal 2:

Host namespace

```

In hindsight, it should probably make sense - after all, we are playing with a _mount_ namespace (and there is no such thing as _filesystem_ namespaces, for better or worse).

💡 Interesting fact: Mount namespaces were the first namespace type added to Linux, appearing in Linux 2.4, ca. 2002.

💡 Pro Tip: You can quickly check the current mount namespace of a process using the following command:

```
readlink /proc/$PID/ns/mnt

```

Different inode numbers in the output will indicate different namespaces. Try running `readlink /proc/self/ns/mnt` from Terminal 1 and Terminal 2.

### What the Heck is Mount Propagation?

Before we jump to how exactly mount namespaces are applied by ~~Docker~~ an OCI runtime (e.g., [runc](https://labs.iximiuz.com/challenges/start-container-with-runc)) to create containers, we need to learn about one more important (and related) concept - mount propagation.

⚠️ Make sure to exit the namespaced shell in Terminal 1 before proceeding with the commands in this section.

If you tried to re-do the experiment from the previous section using the `unshare()` system call instead of the `unshare` CLI command, the results might look different.

unshare_lite.go

```
package main

import "os"
import "os/exec"
import "syscall"

func main() {
  if err := syscall.Unshare(syscall.CLONE_NEWNS); err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }

  cmd := exec.Command("bash")
  cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin
  cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
  cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
  cmd.Env = os.Environ()

  cmd.Run()
}

```

Build the above improvised `unshare_lite` program with:

```
go build -o unshare_lite unshare_lite.go

```

And run it from Terminal 1:

Then mount something:

This time, the results of the `ls -l /mnt` will look identical in Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. Thus, the mount namespace alone may not be enough to provide the mount table isolation.

If you compare the mount tables by running `findmnt` from Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, they will look the same:

Host namespace

New namespace

```

```

When you _unshare_ a new mount namespace, it gets a full copy of the mount table of the caller process. However, changes to the caller's mount table _may be propagated_ to the new mount table and vice versa.

But why? 🤔

Today, containers can easily be the main "consumer" of mount namespaces. However, the applicability of mount namespaces is not limited to containerization use cases. For example, they can be used to provide per-user views of the filesystem.

The original implementation of mount namespaces came out too strict, and [it led to tedious repetitive work for system administrators](https://lwn.net/Articles/689856/). To alleviate the problem, the kernel was extended with the mechanism of [shared subtrees](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt), which in particular introduced mount event propagation between _peer groups_ (of mount points).

![Mount event propagation is a kernel mechanism of replicating mount and umount operations between peer groups (of mount points).](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/container-filesystem-from-scratch/__static__/mount-event-propagation.png)

_Mount event propagation, visualized_

For instance, if multiple users on the system were using separate mount namespaces to isolate their root filesystems, without mount event propagation, mounting a new shared volume would require N `mount` operations, where N is equal to the number of users. While with mount event propagation, system administrators need to mount the volume only once, and the change will be replicated in all _peer groups_, even across different mount namespaces.

🤓 Neither kernel documentation nor the mount namespace man page use the term mount propagation \- instead, they refer to it as propagation type (of a mount point). However, the term mount propagation seems to be [commonly used in the industry](https://lwn.net/Articles/690679/), including in the Docker ([example](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation)) and Kubernetes ([example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation)) documentation.

Mount event propagation is exactly what we've just observed when we tried using the `unshare` system call directly from a Go program: when the `/tmp` folder was bind-mounted to the `/mnt` folder in the new mount namespace, the original namespace received a _mount event_ and replicated the change creating a similar `/tmp:/mnt` mount.

Hmm… Why didn't it happen when we used the standard `unshare` command-line tool? 🤔

The `unshare` CLI tool does slightly more than just the `unshare()` system call. You can sneak a peek under the hood of the `unshare` CLI with the following `strace` trick (from a fresh terminal):

```
sudo strace unshare --mount bash

```

When you cut through the noise of the trace, you'll spot these three important system calls done in a sequence:

```
...
unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)                    = 0
mount("none", "/", NULL, MS_REC|MS_PRIVATE, NULL) = 0
execve("/usr/bin/bash", ["bash"], 0x7fff03d0e038 /* 19 vars */) = 0
...

```

Right _after_ creating a new mount namespace and _before_ executing the `bash` binary, the `unshare` command also changed the mount propagation type of the root mount point. The above `mount()` call is equivalent to the following `mount` command:

…which means that in the new mount namespace, the root mount and _all its sub-mounts_ (`MS_REC` and `r` in `rprivate` stand for _recursive_) become completely isolated from the outside world - mounting new filesystems inside the mount namespace won't be noticeable in the caller's (i.e., the host's, in our case) mount namespace and vice versa.

💡 Mount propagation type is a property of a mount point. Since each mount point belongs to the corresponding mount namespace, the mount propagation type is also a namespace-specific property. For instance, the root mount `/` can have a `shared` mount propagation type in one namespace and `private` in another.

No mount event propagation between namespaces:

```
sudo unshare --mount --propagation private
findmnt -o TARGET,SOURCE,FSTYPE,PROPAGATION

```

```
TARGET                         SOURCE      FSTYPE      PROPAGATION

  └─/run/user/1001             tmpfs       tmpfs       private

```

Mount events are propagated in both ways:

```
sudo unshare --mount --propagation shared
findmnt -o TARGET,SOURCE,FSTYPE,PROPAGATION

```

```
TARGET                         SOURCE      FSTYPE      PROPAGATION
/                              /dev/vda    ext4        shared

  └─/run/user/1001             tmpfs       tmpfs       shared

```

Mount events are propagated from the caller's namespace to the new one (but not backward):

```
sudo unshare --mount --propagation slave
findmnt -o TARGET,SOURCE,FSTYPE,PROPAGATION

```

```
TARGET                         SOURCE      FSTYPE      PROPAGATION

```

Why does mount propagation matter for us? Two reasons:

- `pivot_root`, the modern `chroot` alternative most container runtimes rely on, comes with its own requirements for the mount propagation type of the involved mount points (we'll see it in the next section).
- Some applications may want to mount filesystems on the host while running in a container and some others may need to spot the host (or peer containers) mounting filesystems in runtime (e.g., [`HostToContainer` and `Bidirectional` mount propagations in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation)). More on it later.

### A Naive Attempt to Isolate Container Filesystem

Mount namespaces and propagation are great, but how is all this stuff used in containers? Let's try creating a simple container to see this machinery in action.

⚠️ Make sure to exit the namespaced shell in Terminal 1 before proceeding with the commands in this section.

#### Preparing Container Rootfs

First off, we'll need to prepare the future root filesystem. From the host's standpoint, each container's rootfs is just a regular folder with some files inside:

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/container-1/rootfs

```

For this experiment, we can "borrow" the Alpine filesystem [by extracting the `alpine:3` image](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/extracting-container-image-filesystem) into the directory we just created:

```
crane export alpine:3 | sudo tar -xvC /opt/container-1/rootfs

```

If you compare the contents of the `/opt/container-1/rootfs` and the host's `/` folders, they will look surprisingly similar:

```
tree -L 1 /opt/container-1/rootfs

```

```
/opt/container-1/rootfs/
├── bin
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib
...
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var

18 directories, 0 files

```

```
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
...
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var

24 directories, 0 files

```

However, upon closer inspection, you'll see that it's two different Linux distributions:

```
cat /opt/container-1/rootfs/etc/os-release

```

```
NAME="Alpine Linux"
ID=alpine
VERSION_ID=3.22.1
PRETTY_NAME="Alpine Linux v3.22"
HOME_URL="https://alpinelinux.org/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues"

```

```
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS"

#### Switching to New Rootfs (pivot_root)

The [`pivot\_root(new\_root, put_old)` syscall](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pivot_root.2.html) changes the root mount in the mount namespace of the calling process. More precisely, it moves the current root mount of the caller to the directory `put_old` and makes `new_root` the new root mount.

What it practically means is that by calling `pivot_root("/opt/container-1/rootfs")` in a new mount namespace, we'll switch to the new root filesystem.

![pivot_root changes the root mount in the mount namespace of the calling process.](https://labs.iximiuz.com/content/files/tutorials/container-filesystem-from-scratch/__static__/pivot-root.png)

💡 From a layman's standpoint, `pivot_root` is a safer version of `chroot` \- similar effect but no risk of breakouts via forgotten symlinks to the old root filesystem or the double-chroot trick.

The `pivot_root()` call comes with a number of restrictions, in particular:

- The `new_root` path must be a mount point, but can't be `/` (well, attempting `pivot_root("/")` wouldn't make much sense anyway).
- The propagation type of the parent mount of `new_root` and the parent mount of the current root directory must not be `shared`.
- If `put_old` is an existing mount point, its propagation type must not be `shared`.

Expectedly, we only want to perform such a disruptive operation from a separate mount namespace (otherwise, we'd damage the host), and the last two restrictions ensure that `pivot_root` never propagates any mount table changes to another mount namespace:

```
sudo unshare --mount bash

```

Now let's try satisfying the `pivot_root`'s requirements. The propagation type of the `/` mount (the parent mount of the current root directory) should not be `shared`. The above `unshare` command has likely already set it to `private` but being explicit won't hurt:

💡 Interesting fact: runc uses `rslave` instead of `rprivate` [citing a possibility of a race condition](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/b27d6f3f1af9a56f2770c8ec6e1a1ff986ca9c09/libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go#L1112). But both values should be good enough for our demo example.

In our case, the `/opt/container-1/rootfs` folder is not a mount point (it's a regular folder somewhere in the host's filesystem), but we can easily make it a mount point by bind mounting the path onto itself (using a recursive bind mount because hypothetically the container rootfs folder itself can contain sub-mounts):

```
mount --rbind /opt/container-1/rootfs /opt/container-1/rootfs

```

Lastly, ensuring that the propagation type of the `new_root` itself isn't `shared`:

```
mount --make-rprivate /opt/container-1/rootfs

```

Now we're ready to ~~chroot~~ pivot the root filesystem:

```
cd /opt/container-1/rootfs
mkdir .oldroot

```

…and immediately after that, switch to a shell from the new rootfs because the current `bash` process may get broken in subtle ways after a `pivot_root` into a completely different Linux distro (this part is only needed for our demo example - real-world container runtimes usually don't have this issue because they communicate with the kernel directly, using syscalls instead of shell commands):

Interestingly, after the `pivot_root` operation, [container runtimes are free to set the propagation type of the new root filesystem to pretty much any value](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/config-linux.md#rootfs-mount-propagation) (`shared`, `slave`, `private`, and even `unbindable`):

💡 Propagation type of the container root filesystem should not be confused with the propagation type of bind mounts and volumes in Docker and Kubernetes respectively (see below). This is an advanced setting that is often not even exposed through the user-facing APIs of the higher-level container runtimes, and the most typical use case for it is nested containers (e.g., [DinD](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker)).

Finally, since you probably don't want the original root filesystem to be accessible in the container, the `.oldroot` can (and should) be removed right after the `pivot_root` call:

```
umount -l .oldroot  # -l stands for "lazy" because the fs can be busy
rm -rf .oldroot

```

Yay! We've just pivoted into a new container. Let's look around:

```
ls -l /
total 68
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Jul 15 10:42 bin
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Sep  7 12:40 dev
drwxr-xr-x   17 root     root          4096 Jul 15 10:42 etc
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Jul 15 10:42 home
...
drwxr-xr-x   11 root     root          4096 Jul 15 10:42 var

```

```
NAME="Alpine Linux"
ID=alpine
VERSION_ID=3.22.1
PRETTY_NAME="Alpine Linux v3.22"
HOME_URL="https://alpinelinux.org/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues"

```

So far so good! But if you try listing processes, the output will be empty (which of course can't be true):

And the `df` command also seems broken:

```
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
df: /proc/mounts: No such file or directory

```

### Preparing a Complete Container Filesystem

The `df`'s error message contained a hint - the `/proc` folder is empty in the new mount namespace:

Hmm… How come?

Well, apparently, not every part of the container root filesystem comes from its image!

Similarly to the host, where [`/proc` is populated by the corresponding kernel pseudo filesystem](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html), container's `/proc` needs to be set up separately. And the same goes for `/dev` and `/sys` virtual filesystems.

On top of that, some special files like `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, or `/etc/resolv.conf` should be crafted for each container individually because the corresponding files in the image (if present) can only contain generic values (e.g., `localhost`) while Docker typically sets the hostname of a container to a prefix of its random ID and derives the `resolv.conf` from the eponymous file on the host.

#### Populating /proc Pseudo Filesystem

Populating the `/proc` pseudo filesystem is as simple as:

💡 In reality, container runtimes usually populate the `/proc` filesystem _before_ the `pivot_root` call, so the command would look like `mount -t proc proc $ROOTFS/proc`.

However, if you run the above command right away, the `/proc` filesystem in the container will look exactly the same as the one on the host. In particular, it means that the `ps` command will start showing the full list of processes on the server, which is usually undesirable in a container.

This is where the PID namespace comes into play. We need to go a few steps back and adjust the `unshare` command to create not just the mount but also a new PID namespace, so that the container's topmost process would become PID 1 and the process hierarchy in the container would start from it:

```
# DO NOT RUN ME
sudo unshare --mount --pid --fork bash

```

But let's not do it just yet…

💡 The extra `--fork` flag above doesn't create any new namespaces, but rather makes `unshare` create a new process instead of exec'ing the `bash` command directly. This is a requirement to make the `--pid` flag actually have the effect on the unshared command because it's the first child that gets placed into the new PID namespace, not the process that called `unshare(CLONE_NEWPID)` itself.

#### Populating /dev Pseudo Filesystem

Another special folder is `/dev`. On the host, it's typically provided by the `devtmpfs` and a number of subordinate virtual filesystems (from a fresh terminal):

```
TARGET            SOURCE   FSTYPE   OPTIONS
/                 /dev/vda ext4     rw,relatime,stripe=4
├─/dev            devtmpfs devtmpfs rw,relatime,size=4068368k,nr_inodes=1017092,mode=755
│ ├─/dev/shm      tmpfs    tmpfs    rw,nosuid,nodev
│ ├─/dev/pts      devpts   devpts   rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000
│ ├─/dev/mqueue   mqueue   mqueue   rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime
...

```

However, containers usually get a more limited version of the `/dev` folder, backed by a regular `tmpfs`. Here is how it can be populated from inside the new mount namespace (back from Terminal 1):

```
mkdir -p /dev
mount -t tmpfs -o nosuid,strictatime,mode=0755,size=65536k tmpfs /dev

```

💡 In reality, container runtimes usually populate the `/dev` filesystem _before_ the `pivot_root` call, so the command would look like `mount -t tmpfs … $ROOTFS/dev`.

After mounting the `/dev` tmpfs, you'd need to create special character devices such as `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, `/dev/random`, etc. Here is how you can do it using the `mknod` command:

```
mknod -m 666 /dev/null    c 1 3
chown root:root /dev/null

mknod -m 666 /dev/zero    c 1 5
chown root:root /dev/zero

# etc.

```

Then, mount the subordinate filesystems (`/dev/shm`, `/dev/pts`, and `/dev/mqueue`):

```
mkdir -p /dev/shm
mount -t tmpfs -o nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=1777,size=67108864 tmpfs /dev/shm

```

```
mkdir -p /dev/pts
mount -t devpts -o newinstance,ptmxmode=0666,mode=0620 devpts /dev/pts

```

```
mkdir -p /dev/mqueue
mount -t mqueue -o nosuid,nodev,noexec mqueue /dev/mqueue

```

And lastly, set up some well-known symlinks:

```
ln -sf /proc/self/fd   /dev/fd
ln -sf /proc/self/fd/0 /dev/stdin
ln -sf /proc/self/fd/1 /dev/stdout
ln -sf /proc/self/fd/2 /dev/stderr
ln -sf /proc/kcore     /dev/core

```

#### Populating /sys Pseudo Filesystem

The most limited of the containers' pseudo filesystems is probably [`/sys`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.txt). It's usually mounted read-only and contains only a few nodes:

```
mount -t sysfs -o ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec sysfs /sys

```

💡 In reality, container runtimes usually populate the `/sys` filesystem _before_ the `pivot_root` call, so the command would look like `mount -t sysfs … $ROOTFS/sys`.

A prominent part of the `/sys` filesystem is the [virtual cgroup filesystem](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/controlling-process-resources-with-cgroups). Since a few years ago, Docker and other popular container runtimes started fully isolating the container's cgroup hierarchy by default. Similarly to the `/proc` filesystem that works best in combination with a new PID namespace, a new cgroup namespace can be used to make the `cgroup2` mount rooted at the host's cgroupfs node that corresponds to the container's topmost process. Thus, the `unshare` command would need one more flag, `--cgroup`:

```
# DO NOT RUN ME
sudo unshare --mount --pid --fork --cgroup bash

```

To mount the `cgroup2` filesystem, you can use the following command:

```
mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup
mount -t cgroup2 -o ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec cgroup2 /sys/fs/cgroup

```

#### Hardening Pseudo Filesystems

While it is not strictly necessary for a demo, real-world container root filesystems usually go through an extra round of hardening. For instance, Docker typically marks a few parts of the `/proc` filesystem as _read-only_ and _masks_ others, making them completely inaccessible to the containerized app.

Here is how you can get a list of sensitive locations that are made read-only by Docker (from a fresh terminal):

```
docker container inspect \
    $(docker run --rm -d alpine:3 sleep 5) \
    --format '{{join .HostConfig.ReadonlyPaths "\n"}}'

```

```
/proc/bus
/proc/fs
/proc/irq
/proc/sys
/proc/sysrq-trigger

```

You can make any file or folder read-only by binding it to itself and remounting it using the `ro` option:

```
RO_PATH=/proc/bus # or /proc/fs, /proc/irq, etc.

if [ -e "$RO_PATH" ]; then
  mount --bind "$RO_PATH" "$RO_PATH"
  mount -o remount,bind,ro "$RO_PATH"
fi

```

Similarly, here is how you can get a list of locations that are typically made completely inaccessible (through masking) to the containerized app:

```
docker container inspect \
    $(docker run --rm -d alpine:3 sleep 5) \
    --format '{{join .HostConfig.MaskedPaths "\n"}}'

```

```
/proc/asound
/proc/acpi
/proc/interrupts
/proc/kcore
/proc/keys
/proc/latency_stats
/proc/timer_list
/proc/timer_stats
/proc/sched_debug
/proc/scsi
/sys/firmware
/sys/devices/virtual/powercap

```

Masking of folders and regular files differs. To mask a folder, a read-only `tmpfs` filesystem can be mounted over it, and to mask a regular file, the `/dev/null` device can be bound to its path.

```
MASKED_FILE=/proc/asound  # or /proc/interrupts, /proc/kcore, etc.
mount --bind /dev/null $MASKED_FILE

MASKED_DIR=/proc/acpi    # or /proc/scsi, etc.
mount -t tmpfs -o ro tmpfs $MASKED_DIR

```

💡 The above read-only and masked paths are Docker's defaults for non-privileged containers, while the OCI Runtime Spec defines only the hardening mechanism and not the exact locations (see [Masked Paths](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/e3c8d12d94cdd269a145a263ace7457f56c74eff/config-linux.md#masked-paths) and [Readonly Paths](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/e3c8d12d94cdd269a145a263ace7457f56c74eff/config-linux.md#readonly-paths)).

#### Preparing Special /etc Files

Some of the regular files in the container rootfs also require special treatment:

- `/etc/hosts`
- `/etc/hostname`
- `/etc/resolv.conf`

Inspecting these files in the `/opt/container-1/rootfs` folder right after extracting the Alpine rootfs into it would reveal why:

```
cat /opt/container-1/rootfs/etc/{hosts,hostname,resolv.conf}

```

```
# -- /opt/container-1/rootfs/etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.localdomain
::1             localhost localhost.localdomain

# -- /opt/container-1/rootfs/etc/hostname
localhost

# -- /opt/container-1/rootfs/etc/resolv.conf
cat: /opt/container-1/rootfs/resolv.conf: No such file or directory

```

The above are some generic values that come directly from the `alpine:3` image, which wouldn't make much sense in any particular container. At the same time, these files would look very different when inspected from a running `alpine:3` container:

```
docker run --rm alpine:3 cat /etc/{hosts,hostname,resolv.conf}

```

```
# -- /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
172.17.0.2      2f26e97ae70c

# -- /etc/hostname
2f26e97ae70c

# -- /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by Docker Engine.
# This file can be edited; Docker Engine will not make further changes once it
# has been modified.

nameserver 168.119.149.157
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1

# Based on host file: '/etc/resolv.conf' (legacy)
# Overrides: []

```

Thus, Docker (or one of its underlying runtimes) replaces the generic `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, and `/etc/resolv.conf` files from the image with container-specific variants.

We can do it, too! Our container has no network interfaces (modulo `loopback`), but it can still have a proper hostname set (from the host's terminal):

```
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /opt/container-1/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost container-1
::1             localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
EOF

```

```
cat | sudo tee /opt/container-1/hostname <<EOF
container-1
EOF

```

```
sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /opt/container-1/resolv.conf

```

💡 The `/etc/resolv.conf` file is usually based on the host's `/etc/resolv.conf` file, and then potentially adjusted to the container's needs.

The most interesting part is how these files are placed into the container's rootfs. Instead of just overwriting the files from the image, container runtimes usually mount the container-specific variants of these files on top of the original ones, effectively masking them:

```
sudo mount --bind /opt/container-1/hosts /opt/container-1/rootfs/etc/hosts
sudo mount --bind /opt/container-1/hostname /opt/container-1/rootfs/etc/hostname
sudo mount --bind /opt/container-1/resolv.conf /opt/container-1/rootfs/etc/resolv.conf

```

Last but not least, for the container to have its own hostname, the container needs to use a new network and UTS namespaces, so the `unshare` command would need to have two more flags (`--uts` and `--net`):

```
# DO NOT RUN ME
sudo unshare --mount --pid --fork --cgroup --uts --net bash

```

💡 If we forget to use a new UTS namespace, setting the hostname in the new container will overwrite the host's hostname, which is something we definitely don't want. And without a new network namespace, the container simply cannot have its own hostname, because then it technically [has the same network stack as the host (which in particular includes the hostname)](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/container-networking-from-scratch).

Finally, we're ready to prepare a fully isolated container filesystem!

### Creating a Container from Scratch (end-to-end example)

With all the above lessons learned, let's try creating our second container, this time applying all the necessary namespaces and rootfs adjustments.

💡 The below commands are based on the [real container preparation steps taken by the runc runtime](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/b27d6f3f1af9a56f2770c8ec6e1a1ff986ca9c09/libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go) obtained with the following `strace` trick:

```
# Terminal 1
sudo strace -f -qqq -e \
    trace=/clone,/exec,/unshare,/mount,/mknod,/mkdir,/link,/chdir,/root \
    -p $(pgrep containerd)

```

```
# Terminal 2
docker run alpine:3 sleep 9999

```

#### Step 1: Prepare Rootfs Files

⚠️ Make sure to exit the namespaced shell in Terminal 1 before proceeding with the commands in this section.

The second container will be stored in the `/opt/container-2` directory:

```
CONTAINER_DIR=/opt/container-2
ROOTFS_DIR=${CONTAINER_DIR}/rootfs

```

Similar to the first container, we'll use the `alpine:3` image to "borrow" the rootfs files:

```
sudo mkdir -p $ROOTFS_DIR
crane export alpine:3 | sudo tar -xvC $ROOTFS_DIR

```

This time, we'll create the `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, and `/etc/resolv.conf` files beforehand (but store them outside of the rootfs dir for now):

```
cat <<EOF | sudo tee $CONTAINER_DIR/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost container-2
::1             localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
EOF

```

```
cat <<EOF | sudo tee $CONTAINER_DIR/hostname
container-2
EOF

```

```
sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf $CONTAINER_DIR/resolv.conf

```

#### Step 2: Create Namespaces

Create all the required namespaces with the `unshare` command (mount, PID, cgroup, UTS, and network):

```
sudo unshare --mount --pid --fork --cgroup --uts --net bash

```

💡 [Other possible namespaces are](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html):

- `ipc` \- this namespace has no impact on the rootfs creation, so we're skipping it for brevity
- `time` \- (optional) not used by Docker or other mainstream container runtimes yet
- `user` \- (optional) rootless containers is an advanced topic that deserves its own tutorial

#### Step 3: Isolate New Mount Namespace

From now on, all commands are executed as `root` and in the new namespaces, so we're skipping the `sudo` prefix, and the `CONTAINER_DIR` and `ROOTFS_DIR` variables may need to be re-set:

```
CONTAINER_DIR=/opt/container-2
ROOTFS_DIR=${CONTAINER_DIR}/rootfs

```

First, we need to make sure that no mount events are propagated back to the host's mount namespace:

Then, we need to make sure that the root filesystem itself is a mount point:

```
mount --rbind $ROOTFS_DIR $ROOTFS_DIR

```

…and that the propagation type of the root filesystem isn't `shared`:

```
mount --make-private $ROOTFS_DIR

```

#### Step 4: Prepare /proc Pseudo Filesystem

Mount `/proc` pseudo filesystem:

```
mkdir -p $ROOTFS_DIR/proc
mount -t proc proc $ROOTFS_DIR/proc

```

⚠️ Security Caveat: In untrusted rootfs, `$ROOTFS_DIR/<path>` can be a symlink pointing outside of `$ROOTFS_DIR`. This can make the above and many of the below operations corrupt the host system.

Real-world container runtimes typically use the [`openat2()` syscall with the `RESOLVE\_NO\_SYMLINKS` flag](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html) to first open the target file or directory ensuring it's not a symlink, and then use `mount` (or other filesystem operations) on an open file descriptor instead of a textual filename. The latter helps to avoid [TOCTTOU vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use) when the `$ROOTFS_DIR` contents are changed _while_ the container is being created.

However, in a demo context it should be relatively safe to operate with regular filenames. So, we'll do it the simpler way for brevity.

#### Step 5: Prepare /dev Pseudo Filesystem

Mount `/dev` pseudo filesystem as a regular `tmpfs`:

```
mount -t tmpfs \
    -o nosuid,strictatime,mode=0755,size=65536k tmpfs \
    $ROOTFS_DIR/dev

```

Create the standard character devices (`/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, `/dev/random`, etc.):

```
mknod -m 666 "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/null"    c 1 3
mknod -m 666 "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/zero"    c 1 5
mknod -m 666 "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/full"    c 1 7
mknod -m 666 "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/random"  c 1 8
mknod -m 666 "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/urandom" c 1 9
mknod -m 666 "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/tty"     c 5 0

chown root:root "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/"{null,zero,full,random,urandom,tty}

```

Create typical symlinks:

```
ln -sf /proc/self/fd   "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/fd"
ln -sf /proc/self/fd/0 "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/stdin"
ln -sf /proc/self/fd/1 "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/stdout"
ln -sf /proc/self/fd/2 "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/stderr"
ln -sf /proc/kcore     "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/core"

```

Create subordinate filesystems (`/dev/pts`, `/dev/shm`, `/dev/mqueue`):

```
mkdir -p "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/pts"

mount -t devpts \
    -o newinstance,ptmxmode=0666,mode=0620 devpts \
    $ROOTFS_DIR/dev/pts

ln -sf /dev/pts/ptmx "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/ptmx"

```

```
mkdir -p "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/mqueue"

mount -t mqueue \
    -o nosuid,nodev,noexec mqueue \
    $ROOTFS_DIR/dev/mqueue

```

```
mkdir -p "$ROOTFS_DIR/dev/shm"

mount -t tmpfs \
    -o nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=1777,size=67108864 tmpfs \
    $ROOTFS_DIR/dev/shm

```

#### Step 6: Prepare /sys Pseudo Filesystem

Mount a read-only `/sys` pseudo filesystem:

```
mkdir -p "$ROOTFS_DIR/sys"

mount -t sysfs \
    -o ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec sysfs \
    $ROOTFS_DIR/sys

```

Mount the subordinate `cgroup2` filesystem as `/sys/fs/cgroup`:

```
mkdir -p "$ROOTFS_DIR/sys/fs/cgroup"

mount -t cgroup2 \
    -o ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec cgroup2 \
    $ROOTFS_DIR/sys/fs/cgroup

```

#### Step 7: Bind Hostname, Hosts, and resolv.conf Files

Bind the container-specific `hostname`, `hosts`, and `resolv.conf` files from `/opt/container-2`, masking the original files in the rootfs' `/etc` directory:

```
for p in hostname hosts resolv.conf
do
  touch $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/$p
  mount --bind "$CONTAINER_DIR/$p" $ROOTFS_DIR/etc/$p
done

```

#### Step 8: Pivot into the New Rootfs

Finally, pivot into the fully prepared root filesystem:

```
cd $ROOTFS_DIR
mkdir -p .oldroot

pivot_root . .oldroot

```

This is not something a real runtime would do, but since we use a shell, it's better to exec into the target container's shell as soon as possible after the `pivot_root` call:

Configure the propagation type of the container's root filesystem (setting it arbitrarily to `slave`, [but the OCI Runtime Specification supports `private` and even `shared`](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/383cadbf08c0be925b62a4532e99a538249797e6/config-linux.md#rootfs-mount-propagation)):

And lastly, getting rid of the link to the old root filesystem:

```
umount -l .oldroot
rmdir .oldroot

```

Set the hostname of the container using the value from the container's `/etc/hostname` file:

```
hostname $(cat /etc/hostname)

```

#### Step 9: Harden Container Filesystem

Making a good part of the `/proc` filesystem read-only:

```
for d in bus fs irq sys sysrq-trigger
do
  if [ -e "/proc/$d" ]; then
    mount --bind "/proc/$d" "/proc/$d"
    mount -o remount,bind,ro "/proc/$d"
  fi
done

```

Masking sensitive paths in the `/proc` and `/sys` filesystems:

```
for p in \
  /proc/asound \
  /proc/interrupts \
  /proc/kcore \
  /proc/keys \
  /proc/latency_stats \
  /proc/timer_list \
  /proc/timer_stats \
  /proc/sched_debug \
  /proc/acpi \
  /proc/scsi \
  /sys/firmware
do
  if [ -d "$p" ]; then
    # Masking a folder
    mount -t tmpfs -o ro tmpfs $p
  elif [ -f "$p" ]; then
    # Masking a regular file
    mount --bind /dev/null $p
  fi
done

```

#### Step 10: Execute Target Application

At this point, the containerized environment is ready to be used. Feel free to look around using the `ps`, `ls`, `mount`, `df`, `hostname`, and any other commands you can think of, and then `exec` the containerized application:

```
APP=${APP:-/bin/sh}
exec $APP

```

### Bonus: Sharing Host Files and Folders with Containers

One of the very common Docker use cases, especially during local development, is sharing files and folders from the host into the container via [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) like this:

```
# Traditional -v|--volume flag
docker run -v ./data:/data redis

# More modern but equivalent --mount form
docker run --mount type='bind,src=./data,dst=/data' redis

```

In the previous section(s), we saw that regular files located on the host can be bind mounted into the future container's root filesystem. This is exactly how ~~Docker~~ runc and similar container runtimes inject the customized `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, and `/etc/resolv.conf` files.

But the exact same technique can be used to inject any other files or folders from the host into the container.

The `strace -p $(pgrep containerd)` command that we used to reverse engineer the rootfs preparation steps will reveal that the bind mounts of the `-v|--volume` flag happen right after the pseudo filesystems preparation and just before the mounts of the `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, and `/etc/resolv.conf` files.

And it's a good thing we invested some time in learning about the _mount event propagation_ mechanism - Docker allows [configuring the propagation type for bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation), so the following command should not look like a magic spell anymore:

```
docker run -v .:/project:ro,rshared ...

```

In the above example, if the containerized application would mount a sub-folder under `/project`, it would be visible on the host as well (and vice versa). However, the default propagation type of a Docker bind mount is `rprivate`, so don't be surprised if you don't see sub-mounts showing up.

### Bonus: Adding Support for Data Volumes

While Docker docs position [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) as a distinct concept, under the hood, they are just bind mounts, but with a few extra features like naming, lifecycle management, and various data source drivers support:

```
# Traditional -v|--volume flag
docker run --volume redis-data:/data redis

# More modern but equivalent --mount form
docker run --mount type='volume,src=redis-data,dst=/data' redis

```

Instead of arbitrary folders on the host, volume data is always stored in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/CONTAINER\_ID/\_data`, and you can list all existing volumes with the `docker volume ls` command, or create new ones with `docker volume create`, or even purge them with `docker volume rm`. But at the end of the day, you're just listing, creating, or removing `_data` folders in the `/var/lib/docker/volumes` directory.

Interesting that Docker always sets mount propagation for volumes to `rprivate` (for bind mounts you could tweak it), while Kubernetes, despite relying on the exact same runc (or the like) runtime under the hood, allows more flexible mount propagation configuration ([`HostToContainer`, `Bidirectional`, etc.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation)).

So, in Docker, bind mounts vs. volumes is more of a semantic difference (and induced artificial constraints on the data location and propagation type) than an actual technical difference.

### Where Do Union Filesystems come into Play?

One of the things we didn't talk about in this article is _union filesystems_ like `overlayfs` \- simply because despite popular belief, they're not mandatory for containers.

As we just proved with the above demo, it's possible to create a fully-fledged container without relying on a union filesystem at all. Docker uses [`overlay2`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/drivers/overlayfs-driver/) (or [an alternative](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/drivers/)) storage driver to unpack layered container images into "flat" local folders. However, this is only an optimization, mainly focused on the disk space efficiency - as we just saw, it's possible to extract a container image filesystem into a regular folder with `crane export` (or a similar command), and the container runtime (e.g., runc) will happily use it as a root filesystem.

### Summarizing

At the heart of containers lies the mount namespace. That's not an accident - Linux has long treated the filesystem as the central interface for managing processes, devices, and resources. Once you start assembling a root filesystem for a container, it quickly becomes clear that other namespaces - PID, cgroup, UTS, and network \- are interconnected and much needed to complete the task.

This is why walking through the rootfs exercise isn't just an impressive low-level demo you could give at a conference. It's a way to build a comprehensive mental model of how containers work. And with that model in place, higher-level topics like bind mounts, volumes, mount propagation, and persistence in Docker or Kubernetes stop feeling like special cases - they become natural extensions of the same foundation.

Ah, and if you made it this far, take another look at the diagram from the opening part - it should make much more sense now!

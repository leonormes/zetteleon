## NHS SDE East of England Cohort Discovery Production Collection - Email Summary

### Project Overview

- **Project**: Cohort Discovery NHS SDE (Secure Data Environment), East of England
- **Context**: Production Collection setup and stakeholder communication

### Key Participants

- **Charlotte Weaver** (HDRUK, Technical Project Manager)
- **Laura Clarke** (Health Innovation East, Senior Product Manager)
- **Ollie Rushton** (FITFILE, Senior Software Engineer)
- **Weronika Jastrzebska** (FITFILE, Product Manager)
- Additional CC: Vikas Rachakonda, Sorin Gumeni, Magali Ruffier, Susannah Thomas, Mark Dines-Allen, Robin Mofakham, Leon Ormes, Peter Harrison

### Timeline of Correspondence
#### October 20–30, 2025

- **Initial Setup:** Confirmed that BCRQUEST Collection was set up on Production. Two collections (pre-prod and prod) available for FITFILE.
- **Credentials:** Encrypted username/password sent separately to technical contacts.
- **Notes:** Dataset, collection size info, and manual refresh for accurate counts discussed.
- **Metadata:** Clarification requested about how total collection size is generated; manual/automated refresh noted.

#### October 28–31, 2025

- **Access & Testing:**
  - Ollie and Weronika assigned to East of England user workgroup.
  - Access approval workflow detailed for Cohort Discovery.
  - Initial cohort discovery query successfully conducted.
  - Next steps: test wider range of queries.

#### November 2025 (ongoing)

- **Go-live Coordination:**
  - Request to make the cohort discovery dataset live and connect to Gateway central record.
  - Validation process: Post-live, users require validation by SDE team to regain access.
  - Gateway and Cohort Discovery sync; "spider arm" visibility and filtering explained.
  - Data size discrepancies noted and discussed.

### Key Decisions & Actions

- **Dataset Naming and Info Panel:**
  - Dataset name to be updated for consistency with Gateway record.
  - Website link and metadata fields addressed (Bunny version, rounding not mandatory for launch).
  - Population count to be approximate and updated monthly.
- **Main Contact Policy:**
  - Issue: BCRQUEST allows only individual contacts, not shared mailbox; workaround proposals discussed.
  - Suggestion to set up a system similar to CPRD (Support Team as primary contact).
  - Main contact must be registered Cohort Discovery user and validated (for now, Magali; will add others as needed).
- **Operational Notes:**
  - Access for users:
    - All testers/support staff must request access and accept T&Cs.
    - Validation by SDE network team required.
  - Once dataset is live, Gateway will show it as "live," enabling queries.
  - Support for metadata and manual refresh outlined.
  - Ongoing communication about demographic counts and data accuracy.

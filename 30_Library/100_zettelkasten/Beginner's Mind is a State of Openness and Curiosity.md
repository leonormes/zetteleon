## Beginner's Mind is a State of Openness and Curiosity

**Summary:** "Beginner's mind" (Shoshin) is a concept from Zen Buddhism that involves approaching every situation with an attitude of openness, eagerness, and a lack of preconceptions, just as a beginner would.

**Details:** This mindset requires letting go of the tendency to contract into certainty or expertise. By remaining open and curious, one fosters flexibility, enhances learning, and brings a sense of freshness to relationships and all aspects of life. It is the practice of seeing things as if for the first time.

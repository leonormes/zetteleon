In the 17th century, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed a profound two-part vision for formalising and automating human reason. The foundation was the [[Characteristica Universalis (Leibniz)]], an imagined universal language for expressing all ideas.18 This would be paired with the [[Calculus Ratiocinator (Leibniz)]], a method for mechanically calculating and solving problems stated in that language.19 This unified project is now widely seen as [[Leibniz's work as a precursor to modern mathematical logic]], setting the stage for centuries of development in logic and computation.

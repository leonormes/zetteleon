Perception involves the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information to represent and understand the presented information or environment. For developers, this translates to how they interpret code on a screen, the structure of a data model, or the output of a debugging session. The way visual information is perceived—such as code layout, syntax highlighting, or the relationships depicted in a UML diagram—influences comprehension, memory, and subsequent problem-solving. An accurate perception of the problem space and the tools at hand is a prerequisite for effective coding.

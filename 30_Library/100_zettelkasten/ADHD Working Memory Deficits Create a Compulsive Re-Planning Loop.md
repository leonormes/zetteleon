## ADHD Working Memory Deficits Create a Compulsive Re-Planning Loop

**Summary:** Deficits in working memory foster a profound lack of self-trust in the ADHD brain, leading to a compulsive need to mentally re-check and re-verify plans, creating a debilitating "re-planning loop."

**Details:** The "out of sight, out of mind" nature of ADHD working memory means that steps in a plan can vanish from the mental workspace if not actively focused on. Acutely aware of this unreliability, the brain develops a cognitive insecurity and a fear of forgetting a critical detail. This anxiety fuels a cycle of cognitive rumination where the individual repeatedly re-reads instructions and mentally rehearses the plan, substituting the act of planning for the act of doing. This cycle is a primary engine for anxiety and negative self-talk.

The key to a successful and sustainable timeboxing practice is to build in flexibility. The goal is to create a guide for your time, not a rigid prison.

This can be achieved by:

- **Having a baseline schedule** that can be adjusted as needed.
- **Explicitly scheduling downtime,** rest, and unstructured time, not just work.
- **Building in buffer time** between tasks to account for unexpected delays or transitions.
- **Regularly reviewing and revising** the schedule to ensure it aligns with current priorities and energy levels.

A schedule should serve you, not the other way around. By balancing structure with flexibility, timeboxing can remain an effective tool for long-term productivity and well-being.

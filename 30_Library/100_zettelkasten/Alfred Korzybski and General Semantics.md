Alfred Korzybski (1879-1950) was a Polish-American philosopher who developed the field of general semantics and coined the famous phrase "the map is not the territory."

## Core Insight

Korzybski recognized that human knowledge consists of abstractions—models, theories, words, and symbols—that represent reality but are not reality itself. He emphasized that confusing these representations with actual reality leads to fundamental errors in thinking and communication.

## General Semantics Principles

**Abstraction Awareness**: Understanding that all human knowledge involves multiple levels of abstraction from direct sensory experience to complex theoretical models.

**Non-Identity**: The principle that no two things are identical, and our categories and labels inevitably oversimplify the uniqueness of individual phenomena.

**Time-Binding**: Humans' unique ability to accumulate knowledge across generations through symbolic communication, but this same capacity can perpetuate errors when we mistake symbols for reality.

## Influence on Modern Thinking

Korzybski's work anticipated many concepts in:

- Cognitive science's understanding of [[Mental Models as Evolutionary Filters|mental models]]
- Systems thinking and cybernetics
- [[Metacognitive Awareness]] in psychology
- Philosophy of science's recognition that theories are tools, not truth

His emphasis on the provisional nature of all knowledge connects to modern understanding of [[Leaky Abstractions]] and the importance of recognizing model limitations.

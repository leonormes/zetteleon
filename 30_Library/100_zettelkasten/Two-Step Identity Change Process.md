**Summary:** The simplest path to changing who you are is a two-step process: (1) Decide the type of person you want to be, and (2) Prove it to yourself with small wins. This framework makes identity change concrete and actionable.

**Step 1: Decide the Type of Person You Want to Be**

This is about defining your desired identity, not your goals:

**Methods for Deciding:**

- **Direct Declaration:** "I'm the type of person who is consistent and reliable"
- **Question-Based:** "What would a healthy person do?" or "What would a writer do?"
- **Values-Based:** "I want to be someone who values learning and growth"
- **Role Model:** "I want to be the kind of parent/leader/friend who..."

**Key Principle:** Focus on the *who*, not the *what*. Not "I want to lose 20 pounds" but "Who is the type of person who could maintain a healthy weight?"

**Step 2: Prove It to Yourself with Small Wins**

Take tiny actions that reinforce the desired identity:

**How Small Wins Work:**

- **Tiny Actions:** Not "write a novel" but "write 100 words"
- **Consistent Frequency:** Daily proof is more powerful than occasional big actions
- **Self-Evidence:** Each action says "this is who I am"
- **Accumulation:** Small wins stack into undeniable proof

**Examples in Practice:**

**Want to become a writer?**
- Step 1: "I am a writer"
- Step 2: Write 100 words daily (proof through action)

**Want to become fit?**
- Step 1: "I am an athlete"
- Step 2: Do 10 pushups every morning (proof through action)

**Want to become organized?**
- Step 1: "I am someone who keeps their space organized"
- Step 2: Make your bed every morning (proof through action)

**Why This Works:**

- **Step 1** gives direction and clarity about who you're becoming
- **Step 2** provides the evidence your brain needs to believe Step 1
- Together, they create the identity-behavior feedback loop

**The Beauty of Simplicity:**

This two-step process cuts through complexity. You don't need elaborate plans or perfect conditions. Decide who you want to be, then start proving it—one small action at a time.

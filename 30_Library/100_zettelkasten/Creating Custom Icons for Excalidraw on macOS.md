You can create custom icons for Excalidraw on macOS using a variety of tools.

## Icon Creation Tools

- **Vector Drawing (for scalable icons)**: Figma (free tier), Sketch, Affinity Designer, Adobe Illustrator.
- **Raster Drawing**: Pixelmator Pro, Photoshop.
- **Simple Icon Makers**: Apple's built-in **Freeform** app, web tools like **Canva**.

## Icon Management

- **IconJar** (macOS only) and **Iconset** (cross-platform) are excellent tools for organizing, tagging, and searching your icon libraries.

## Workflow for Excalidraw

1. Design your icon in a tool like Figma or Affinity Designer and export it as an **SVG** file.
2. Drag the SVG file directly onto an Excalidraw canvas. It will become an editable element.
3. Select the imported icon and save it to your personal Excalidraw library for easy reuse.

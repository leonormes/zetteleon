## Concept-Orientation Enables Cross-Domain Discovery

**Summary:** Notes should be organized by the core concept they discuss, not by source (author, book, project). This enables discovering connections across seemingly disparate domains and texts.

**Details:** In Zettelkasten methodology, the organizing principle shifts from "Under which topic do I store this note?" (archivist thinking) to "In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?" (writer thinking). When notes are structured by concept rather than by where the information came from, patterns and relationships emerge that would remain hidden in source-based filing systems. A concept from evolutionary biology might illuminate a software architecture problem; an insight from philosophy might connect to machine learning. This cross-pollination only happens when notes are freed from rigid topical hierarchies and source-based boundaries. The practice requires asking "What is this idea fundamentally about?" rather than "Where did this come from?" This conceptual organization is what transforms a mere filing system into a thinking partner capable of surfacing surprising connections.

## Open Communication in a Partnership Requires Active Listening and Collaborative Problem-Solving

**Summary:** A fair expectation in a relationship is that both partners are willing to engage in open and honest communication, which includes active listening, sharing feelings openly, and approaching problems as a team.

**Details:** Active listening involves genuinely trying to understand a partner's perspective, not just waiting to speak. Collaborative problem-solving frames conflicts as "us vs. the problem," fostering teamwork instead of adversarial dynamics.

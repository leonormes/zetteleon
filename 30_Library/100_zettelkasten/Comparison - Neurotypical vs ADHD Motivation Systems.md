## Comparison - Neurotypical Vs ADHD Motivation Systems

| Criteria           | Neurotypical                          | ADHD                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Primary Driver** | Importance/Consequences               | Interest/Novelty                     |
| **Time Focus**     | Future rewards                        | Immediate engagement                 |
| **Dopamine**       | Stable baseline                       | Hyposensitive baseline               |
| **System Use**     | Consistency valued                    | Novelty sought                       |

**Key Insight:**
ADHD requires tailored systems that provide ongoing novelty and interest-based engagement.

**Neurodiversity Note:**
These differences represent natural variations in brain function (see [[ADHD as Neurodiversity Not Deficit]]) rather than deficits.

Source: [[The Two Views of Maths]]

The Idea (In Detail):

The general public's view of mathematics is not incorrect, but it only covers a fraction of the discipline. Most people experience maths as a set of established tools to be applied to problems (like a mechanic using a wrench). They see the application of maths, not its creation. This view is practical, utilitarian, and sufficient for most everyday purposes. The conflict arises when this partial view is mistaken for the entire field.

My Thoughts & Implications:

This implies that maths education fails to communicate the creative, exploratory side of the subject. It teaches students to be mechanics but rarely shows them that an engineer's role even exists. This could be why many people who enjoy creative or abstract thinking feel alienated by school maths. It also raises a question: Should the goal of maths education be to create more "mechanics" or to expose more students to the "engineering" mindset?

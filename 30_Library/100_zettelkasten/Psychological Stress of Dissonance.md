The state of [[Cognitive Dissonance]] is characterized by a feeling of psychological discomfort or mental stress. This feeling arises from the internal inconsistency between conflicting beliefs or between a belief and a behavior.

This discomfort acts as a powerful motivator, pushing the individual to find a way to resolve the conflict and return to a state of cognitive consistency. The drive to resolve this tension is detailed in [[Conflict Resolution in Cognitive Dissonance]].

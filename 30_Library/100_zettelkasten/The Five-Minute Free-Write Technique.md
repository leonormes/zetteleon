This is a practical exercise, inspired by a method described in William Zinsser's "Writing to Learn," designed to overcome the resistance and friction associated with [[The Disappointment of Written Thoughts]].

Its goal is not to produce good writing, but to practice the physical act of converting thought to text and to lower the stakes of the creative process.

## The Technique

1. **Set a Timer:** Choose a short, non-intimidating duration, such as five or ten minutes.
2. **Pick a Topic:** Select a thought, question, or idea you want to explore.
3. **Write Without Stopping:** Begin writing with one absolute rule: you cannot stop typing or moving your pen until the timer goes off.
4. **Do Not Judge or Edit:** If you run out of things to say, write "I don't know what to say next" or repeat the last word until a new thought arrives. The goal is continuous motion.
5. **Stop When the Timer Ends:** Once the timer goes off, you are done.

This exercise helps to "clear the palate," getting the jumble of thoughts out of your head and onto the page. By consistently practicing this, you train yourself to push through the initial discomfort of [[Writing as a Thinking Tool]] and begin to build a habit of [[Exploratory vs Explanatory Writing|Exploratory Writing]].

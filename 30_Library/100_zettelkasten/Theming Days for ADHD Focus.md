Day-theming is a productivity strategy where each day of the week is assigned a specific focus or type of work. This provides a high-level structure that helps manage focus and energy for the ADHD brain.

## Core Concept

Instead of context-switching between different types of tasks throughout the day, you batch similar activities together. For example:

- **Mondays**: Admin, emails, and planning.
- **Tuesdays**: Deep work and creative projects.
- **Wednesdays**: Meetings and collaboration.

## Why It Works for ADHD

- **Reduces Decision Fatigue**: By pre-deciding the focus for the day, it eliminates the constant need to decide what to work on next, which can be a significant drain on executive function.
- **Improves Focus**: It allows the brain to settle into a specific mode of thinking for a prolonged period, which can help induce a state of flow or [[Hyperfocus is a State of Intense Interest-Driven Focus in ADHD]].
- **Manages Working Memory**: It reduces the cognitive load of holding multiple, disparate tasks in working memory at the same time.

## Connections

- This is a form of [[Environmental Design for ADHD Focus]], where the "environment" is the structure of the day itself.
- It complements [[Timeboxing as a To-Do List Alternative for ADHD]] by providing a framework within which to schedule specific time blocks.

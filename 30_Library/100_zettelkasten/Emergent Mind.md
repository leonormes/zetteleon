I am always worried that my instincts are wrong, and it holds me back. Because I am so worried about it, when I am wrong, I see it as proof to not trust my instincts.

These ideas and thoughts are emergent properties of my subconscious. I can't control them as that would not be emergent. What I can try to control is the input that creates the subconscious. This generator of ideas.

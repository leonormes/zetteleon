The foundational principle of the YNAB method is to "Give Every Dollar a Job." This practice involves proactively assigning every unit of currency you currently possess to a specific category or purpose until no money is left unassigned (i.e., "Ready to Assign" is zero).

This transforms budgeting from a reactive chore into an intentional act of prioritization. It forces you to answer the critical question: "What does this money need to do before I get paid again?" This is the core mechanism for aligning spending with values and is the antidote to [[Reactive Spending Creates Financial Stress]]. It is supported by the other three rules, starting with [[Embrace Your True Expenses (YNAB Rule 2)]].

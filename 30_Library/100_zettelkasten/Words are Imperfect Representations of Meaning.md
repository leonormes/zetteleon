title: Words are Imperfect Representations of Meaning

A powerful metaphor for the relationship between language and meaning is that words are merely shadows of the true meaning they attempt to convey. A shadow is an incomplete, two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional object, dependent on the angle of the light. Similarly, words are imperfect approximations of a rich, multi-faceted concept.

Following this metaphor, [[Paraphrasing is a Complex Cognitive Skill|paraphrasing]] is the art of moving the "light source" (one's linguistic and conceptual understanding) to cast a new and different shadow of the same object. We don't change the core meaning, but we illuminate it from a different angle, revealing new shapes and facets that may have been hidden in the original phrasing.

This idea has deep roots and connects to other philosophical concepts, as explored in [[The Word-as-Shadow Metaphor in Philosophy]].

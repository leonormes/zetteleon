The philosophy of Albert Camus is centered on the Absurd, which he defines not as a property of the universe or of humanity alone, but as the irresolvable conflict born from the confrontation between two opposing forces:

1. The Human Need: Our innate, passionate, and desperate drive to find meaning, reason, order, and significance in life.
2. The Universe's Response: What Camus called the "unreasonable silence of the world." The universe offers no inherent meaning, no grand purpose, and no answers to our ultimate questions.

The feeling of the Absurd is the recognition of this fundamental disconnect. This aligns with the [[The Fractal Model of Self-Referential Meaning]], which posits that meaning is generated internally within "bubbles" of consciousness, not discovered externally.

Camus's philosophy is not just about diagnosing this condition, but about how one should live once this realization is made. This is explored in [[Camus's Three Responses to the Absurd]]. For critiques of Camus's philosophy, see [[Philosophical Critiques of Camus]].

This concept is derived from the broader conversation in [[Contextual Myopia and Human Behavior]].

## The 5-Minute Action Overcomes Initiation Barriers

**What:** A technique to overcome task initiation paralysis by committing to work on an avoided task for an extremely short, non-threatening period.

**How:**
1.  Identify the specific task being avoided.
2.  Set a physical timer for 5 minutes. A physical device is preferred to avoid phone-based distractions.
3.  Work on the task with singular focus for those 5 minutes.
4.  When the timer sounds, give yourself genuine and explicit permission to stop.

**Failure modes:**
-   Not giving yourself genuine permission to stop, which makes the technique feel like a trap.
-   Using a phone timer and getting sidetracked by notifications.

**Example (1 max):** To start writing a report, commit only to opening the document and writing for 5 minutes. Often, the momentum gained is enough to continue working beyond the initial 5-minute mark.

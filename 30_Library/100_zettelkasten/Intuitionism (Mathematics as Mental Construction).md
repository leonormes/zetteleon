**Summary:** Intuitionism asserts that mathematics is a purely mental activity of the human mind. A mathematical object exists only if it can be mentally constructed, and a proof is valid only if it provides a method for that construction.

**Core Thesis:** Mathematical truths are not discovered but created. The first principle is verifiable mental construction. A mathematical object exists only when explicitly constructed.

**Analogy:** A mathematician is a master craftsperson. To claim a sculpture exists, one must provide the step-by-step instructions for carving it from a block of stone; simply asserting its existence is not enough.

**Key Proponent:** L. E. J. Brouwer developed this philosophy in the early 20th century.

**Impact on Classical Mathematics:** This view requires rejecting vast swathes of classical mathematics that rely on non-constructive proofs, such as proofs by contradiction where no explicit construction is provided. Many mathematicians find this too restrictive for practical work.

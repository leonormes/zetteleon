Junebugging is a productivity strategy, particularly useful for multi-step tasks like cleaning or organizing, that works *with* the ADHD brain's tendency to get distracted rather than fighting against it.

## Core Concept

Instead of trying to force sustained focus on a single, large task, you define one small, specific area as your "spot" or home base. You then give yourself permission to wander and get distracted, with the gentle rule that you must always return to your spot.

## Why It Works for ADHD

- **Grants Permission to Wander**: It acknowledges that the ADHD brain will naturally get distracted. By accepting this instead of fighting it, it removes the shame and frustration that often accompanies a loss of focus.
- **Avoids Shame Spirals**: Because distraction is part of the plan, there is no "failure" when it happens. This prevents the shame-procrastination cycle from starting.
- **Provides a Gentle Anchor**: The "spot" acts as a simple, low-friction anchor to return to, making it easy to re-engage with the task without needing to re-plan or overcome significant inertia.
- **Works with Natural Energy Patterns**: It allows for bursts of focused energy interspersed with periods of lower-intensity wandering.

## Connections

(IoED) is a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate their understanding of concepts, mistaking surface familiarity or indirect cues (signals) for deep comprehension. This occurs because we judge our knowledge based on external markers—like familiarity with terms or the ability to give basic explanations—rather than actively testing or applying what we know.

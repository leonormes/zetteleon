## Temporal Discounting is the Cognitive Bias Where People Value Immediate Rewards More

**Summary:** Temporal discounting, or present bias, is the cognitive bias that causes people to dramatically prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones.

**Details:** This bias explains why we often choose immediate gratification (e.g., watching TV) over actions that lead to long-term benefits (e.g., exercising). The perceived value of a reward decreases significantly the further it is in the future. This is a key driver of procrastination, as the effort of a task feels immediate while its reward feels distant.

title: Loss Aversion Describes Asymmetric Pain of Loss vs Pleasure of Gain

Loss aversion is a cognitive bias where the psychological or emotional impact of a loss is significantly greater than the impact of an equivalent gain. It is a central component of Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory.

Empirical studies suggest that the pain of a loss is, on average, about twice as powerful as the pleasure from a corresponding gain. For example, the negative feeling from losing £50 is comparable to the positive feeling from gaining £100. This asymmetry powerfully influences decision-making under uncertainty, often leading to sub-optimal risk-averse behaviour.

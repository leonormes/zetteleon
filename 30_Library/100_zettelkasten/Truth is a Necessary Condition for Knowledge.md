## Truth is a Necessary Condition for Knowledge

**Summary:** Most epistemologists maintain that truth is a necessary condition for knowledge.

**Details:** This principle asserts that one cannot know something that is false. Even if a belief is strongly held and well-justified, if it does not correspond to reality, it does not qualify as knowledge in the strict philosophical sense. While personal or subjective understanding can be formed from false information, it is distinct from objective knowledge.

## Externalizing Progress Makes it Tangible and Motivational

**Summary:** Due to the "out of sight, out of mind" nature of ADHD working memory, progress that is not externally represented is easily forgotten and provides no motivational benefit. It is therefore essential to make progress concrete, tangible, and persistent.

**Details:** Visual systems for tracking progress function as an "external brain" or an external hard drive for working memory. They hold both the plan and, crucially, the record of what has been accomplished, providing a factual record of success that directly combats the common ADHD feeling of "I got nothing done today." Effective methods include physical Kanban boards, a "Done" pile of index cards, or visually marking off completed tasks on a mind map. The physical act of moving a card or checking an item provides a powerful kinesthetic and visual signal of completion.

## Financial Double Standards for Spending Undermine Fairness in a Relationship

**Summary:** Applying a double standard, where one partner's spending is labeled "selfish" while another's is justified, undermines fairness and mutual respect in a relationship.

**Details:** For a financial partnership to be healthy, the same standards must apply to both individuals. Discretionary spending by either partner should be handled according to shared, pre-agreed boundaries. Using one person's spending as a weapon in arguments while excusing another's creates a toxic dynamic of blame and judgment.

## Timeboxing as a To-Do List Alternative for ADHD

For individuals with ADHD, traditional scrolling to-do lists can become a source of overwhelm and paralysis. A more effective strategy is **Timeboxing**, which involves converting tasks into scheduled appointments on a calendar.

### Core Concept

Instead of maintaining a long, abstract list of tasks, each item is given a specific, finite block of time in the day. This provides a clear, visual representation of the day's workload and forces a realistic assessment of what can be achieved.

### Why It Works for ADHD

- **Reduces Overwhelm**: A calendar view is finite and structured, unlike an endless to-do list which can feel overwhelming and trigger avoidance.
- **Combats Time Blindness**: It makes time tangible and helps build a more realistic sense of how long tasks actually take.
- **Prevents Rescheduling Loops**: When a task is a calendar event, it's less likely to be perpetually pushed to the next day, a common failure mode with to-do lists.
- **Creates Structure**: Provides the external structure that the ADHD brain needs to initiate and transition between tasks.

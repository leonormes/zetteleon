This note summarizes the key scientific principles for habit formation and elimination, based on the work of Andrew Huberman.

## Core Models of Habit Formation

- [[Neuroplasticity is the Foundation for Habit Change|Neuroplasticity is the foundation for habit change]], involving the rewiring of neural circuits through repeated experience.
- [[Procedural Memory is Central to Habit Formation|Procedural memory is central]]; mentally rehearsing a habit's sequence makes it easier to perform.

## Key Concepts

- [[Limbic Friction is the Activation Energy for Habits|Limbic Friction]] is the mental barrier of anxiety or tiredness that must be overcome to start a habit.
- [[Strong Habits are Context-Independent|Strong habits are context-independent]], meaning they are performed automatically regardless of the situation.
- [[Identity-Based Habits are More Resilient Than Goal-Based Habits|Identity-based habits]] are more resilient than those based purely on goals.
- [[Task Bracketing Strengthens Habit-Related Neural Circuits|Task bracketing]] involves reinforcing the beginning and end of a habit to strengthen its neural pathway.

## Action Plan: Three-Phase Day Model

[[The Day Can Be Divided Into Three Phases for Habit Mapping|The day can be divided into three phases]] based on neurochemical states, allowing you to align high-friction habits with high-energy periods.

## Tools and Strategies

### For Breaking Habits

- [[Long-Term Depression is a Mechanism for Breaking Habits|Long-Term Depression (LTD)]] can be used to weaken neural pathways by dissociating a trigger from its habitual response.
- [[Positive Cargo is a Strategy for Overwriting Bad Habits|Attaching a "positive cargo"]], or a new adaptive behavior, after an unwanted habit can help overwrite it.

### Dopamine and Reward Optimization

- [[Unpredictable Rewards Accelerate Habit Formation|Unpredictable or "surprise" rewards]] have the strongest effect on accelerating habit formation.

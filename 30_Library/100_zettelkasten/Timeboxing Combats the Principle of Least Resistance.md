Without a clear structure, it is natural to gravitate toward shallow, easy tasks—the path of least resistance. Timeboxing provides the necessary structure to counteract this tendency.

By scheduling specific blocks for deep, difficult work, an individual creates a firm obligation to tackle these challenging tasks. The pre-defined schedule overrides the default behavior of choosing what is easy in the moment.

This structure facilitates deliberate choice, ensuring that important, high-effort tasks are not perpetually pushed aside in favor of more trivial activities.

Shame can be categorized into two functional types:

1. **Productive shame**: Brief discomfort that guides behavior correction without affecting self-worth
2. **Destructive shame**: Persistent, identity-level feeling that one is fundamentally flawed

People with ADHD often experience destructive shame, which doesn't serve the evolutionary purpose of helpful social guidance but instead creates ongoing emotional distress without benefit.

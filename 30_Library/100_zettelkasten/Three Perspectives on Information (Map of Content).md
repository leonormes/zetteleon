title: Three Perspectives on Information (Map of Content)

uid:

The term "information" can be understood from at least three different perspectives, which explains the apparent contradictions.

1. **Semantic / Intuitive Perspective**: [[Information as Perceivable Pattern]]
   - **Core Idea**: Information is a recognisable structure or pattern that has meaning.
   - **Opposite**: Randomness, chaos, noise.

2. **Shannon's Probabilistic Perspective**: [[Shannon's Information Theory - Information as Uncertainty]]
   - **Core Idea**: Information is the reduction of uncertainty. It measures unpredictability.
   - **Maximum Information**: A completely random signal.

3. **Algorithmic Perspective**: [[Kolmogorov Complexity - Information as Compressibility]]
   - **Core Idea**: Information is measured by descriptive complexity. A simple pattern has low information content because its description is short.
   - **Maximum Information**: A completely random string that cannot be compressed.

**Synthesis**: Shannon's theory measures the **capacity** needed to transmit a signal, while the semantic and Kolmogorov views relate to the **meaningful** or **compressible structure** within the signal.

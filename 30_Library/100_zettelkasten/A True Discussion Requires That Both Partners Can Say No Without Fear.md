## A True Discussion Requires That Both Partners Can Say No Without Fear

**Summary:** A conversation ceases to be a genuine discussion when one partner is not allowed to say "no" or disagree without facing anger, disdain, or moral vilification.

**Details:** In a healthy partnership, financial discussions are true dialogues where both partners can openly express concerns and dissent. When one partner's decision is imposed and the other is denied a say through fear of retaliation or emotional manipulation, it removes mutual consent and creates an unhealthy power dynamic.

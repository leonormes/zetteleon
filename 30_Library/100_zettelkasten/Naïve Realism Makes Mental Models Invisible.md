title: Naïve Realism Makes Mental Models Invisible

**Naïve realism** is the inherent and largely unconscious belief that we perceive the world objectively and directly as it truly is, rather than as a subjective interpretation.

This psychological phenomenon is the primary reason our own mental models are invisible to us. We don't feel like we are consulting a model; we feel like we are simply observing reality. The model is the lens through which we see, not something we see itself.

This is a highly efficient evolutionary trait, as it allows for rapid, instinctual decision-making. However, the side effect is a deep-seated assumption that our perception is the single, accurate version of the truth. This makes it difficult to recognize that our understanding is, by definition, a simplification.

This core belief is the foundation upon which other biases, like [[Cognitive Biases Reinforce Mental Models|Confirmation Bias]], can build, further cementing our conviction in our own worldview.

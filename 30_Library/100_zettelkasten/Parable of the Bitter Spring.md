A teacher, seeing his students working tirelessly, gathered them and said, "Let me tell you of the Village of Constant Toil, so that you may understand the nature of your work."

"In this village, the river, which should have been a source of life, brought forth bitter water. Every morning, the people would descend to the riverbank with their buckets and begin the day’s great labour.

They built elaborate filters of charcoal and sand. They kept great fires burning to boil the water, and others would fan it to cool it. Their days were filled with the fetching and the filtering, the boiling and the cooling. They were praised for their diligence, and the sweat on their brow was seen as a mark of virtue. 'See how we labour to make the bitter water sweet!' they would say. And truly, their work never ended.

But one woman in the village did not join them. She saw the endless cycle of their toil, the bent backs and the weary hands, and her heart was moved not by their labour, but by its cause.

One dawn, as the villagers descended to the river, she turned her back to them and began to walk upstream.

The others called to her, 'Where are you going, sister? The work is here! The buckets are waiting! Do not forsake your duty!'

But she continued on, walking against the current, into the hills from which the river flowed. For days she journeyed, tracing the water to its origin. She came at last to the mountain where the river was born: a small, hidden spring bubbling from the earth. And there she found the source of the village’s misery. A gnarled and bitter root had grown into the heart of the spring, poisoning the water from its very inception.

She took a sharp stone, and for a single day, she dug and she cut and she laboured. The work was difficult, but it had a purpose and an end. At last, she pulled the root from the earth and cast it aside. And she watched as the spring water began to flow clear and pure.

When she returned to the village, she found the people as she had left them, still toiling at the riverbank. But then a child, dipping a cup into the stream, cried out in wonder, 'The water is sweet!'

The people stopped their work. They tasted the water, and a silence fell over them, for the river ran pure. The labour of a hundred hands for a hundred years had been made obsolete by the wisdom of one who dared to walk upstream."

The teacher looked upon his students and said, "Therefore, I tell you, do not be content merely to sweeten the bitter water. For true productivity is not found in the ceaseless management of symptoms, but in the courage to journey to the source and heal the problem there."

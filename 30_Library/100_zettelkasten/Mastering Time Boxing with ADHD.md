## What is Time Boxing

Time boxing is a productivity technique where you allocate a fixed, pre-determined amount of time to a task, then stop when the time is up. This method is especially helpful for ADHD brains, which often struggle with time perception and task boundaries.

## Step-by-Step Methodology

### A. Choose Your Task and Set a Box

Pick a single, specific task. Decide how long you’ll work on it (e.g., 25 minutes). Use a timer—visual timers are especially effective for ADHD.

### B. Break Down Large Tasks

If a task feels overwhelming, break it into smaller, time-boxable units. For example, instead of “write report,” try “outline introduction for 25 minutes.”

### C. Estimate Time Realistically

ADHD can distort time perception. Start with short boxes (15–30 minutes) and adjust as you learn your pace. It’s better to underestimate and add more boxes than to overcommit.

### D. Schedule Breaks

After each time box, take a short break (5–10 minutes). Use this time to move, hydrate, or do something enjoyable. This helps reset your focus and prevents burnout.

### E. If You Don’t Finish

If the task isn’t done when the timer rings, pause and assess. Decide if you need another box now, or if it’s better to schedule it for later. Avoid the urge to keep going indefinitely.

### F. Iterate and Adjust

Review how much you accomplished. Adjust future time boxes based on what you learn about your working style.

## Phronesis (Practical Wisdom) is Knowledge Gained Through Action and Experience

**Summary:** In Aristotelian philosophy, *phronesis* (practical wisdom) is a form of intellectual virtue concerned with action, which is distinct from theoretical knowledge (*episteme*) and technical skill (*techne*).

**Details:** Phronesis is the ability to know what to do in particular situations, deliberating about values in context. Aristotle argued that it cannot be learned through study alone but must be developed through experience and the habituation of virtuous action. It represents the bridge between knowing what is good and doing what is good.

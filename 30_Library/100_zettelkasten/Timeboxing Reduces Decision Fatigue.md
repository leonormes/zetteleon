By pre-deciding what to work on and when, timeboxing eliminates the constant, low-level question of "What should I do now?"

This conservation of mental energy is a significant benefit. Every decision, no matter how small, consumes cognitive resources. An unstructured day requires repeated decisions about which task to tackle next, leading to [[Decision Fatigue|decision fatigue]].

With a timeboxed schedule, these decisions are made in advance during a planning session. This frees up mental energy to be spent on the work itself, rather than on the meta-work of planning and prioritizing throughout the day. The transitions between activities become automatic, guided by the calendar.

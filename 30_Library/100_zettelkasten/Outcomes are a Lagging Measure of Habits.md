## Outcomes Are a Lagging Measure of Habits

**Summary:** Your results and outcomes are simply a lagging measure of your underlying habits and systems.

**Details:** The results you see today are not the product of recent actions but the cumulative effect of past habits. For example, your current financial status is a lagging measure of your financial habits, and your current fitness is a lagging measure of your exercise and diet habits. This means that to predict future outcomes, you should look at the trajectory of your current systems, not just your current results.

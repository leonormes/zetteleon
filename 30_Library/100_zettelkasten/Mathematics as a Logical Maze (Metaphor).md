**Summary:** Mathematics is consistently described as a "logical maze"—an intricate network of ideas where the task is to navigate through logical possibilities and discover new connections.

**The Metaphor:**

Like a maze, mathematics consists of:

- **Pathways:** Logical connections between ideas
- **Decision points:** Choices about which approach to pursue
- **Dead ends:** Invalid reasoning or false conjectures
- **Hidden passages:** Unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated concepts
- **Multiple routes:** Different proofs or approaches to the same result

**Implications for Practice:**

This metaphor highlights:

- The interconnectedness of all mathematical concepts
- The process of discovery as exploration and navigation
- The importance of logical reasoning as the "map"
- The possibility of getting lost or stuck
- The satisfaction of finding elegant paths through complexity

**Pedagogical Value:**

The maze metaphor helps students understand that:

- Mathematics is about relationships, not isolated facts
- Getting stuck is part of the process
- There may be multiple valid paths to understanding
- Exploration and experimentation are essential

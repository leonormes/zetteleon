title: Structure conserves cognitive energy for neurodivergent brains

Structure in daily routines conserves cognitive energy for neurodivergent individuals by reducing the executive function demands of planning and decision-making, allowing that energy to be redirected toward more meaningful tasks.

**Implementation Tip:**
While structure is essential, building in controlled novelty (e.g., rotating workspaces, varied routines) can maintain engagement for ADHD brains without sacrificing stability.

title: Newtonian Physics as an Effective Theory

Newtonian physics is a powerful example of an [[Effective Theory]]. It functions with incredible accuracy for everyday phenomena (e.g., building bridges, sending rockets to the Moon) and was considered a complete model for centuries.

However, its foundational principles (absolute time and space) are fundamentally flawed. The "bug" in this model only becomes apparent at extreme scales—near the speed of light or in strong gravitational fields—where the predictions fail and Einstein's General Relativity is required.

This illustrates how a successful model can completely hide its flawed foundation within a specific, common domain of experience.

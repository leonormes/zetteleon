This note outlines a sequence for building a supportive, flexible, and sustainable routine tailored for a neurodivergent brain.

## 1. Understand the Purpose

First, it is crucial to understand *why* routines are so beneficial. They are not about rigid control, but about creating a predictable foundation to reduce cognitive load.

## 2. Lay the Foundation with Self-Awareness

Before you can build a routine that works for you, you must understand your own patterns, needs, and sensitivities. This is the most critical step.

- `enables::` [[Self-Observation is the Foundation of Routine Building]]

## 3. Construct the Core Components

With self-knowledge as your guide, you can now construct the routine itself. A successful routine balances two key elements: consistency and adaptability.

## 4. Use Tools and Maintenance Strategies

Once the basic structure is in place, you can use tools to make it easier to follow and establish a process for keeping it relevant over time.

## 5. Cultivate a Sustainable Mindset

A routine is more likely to succeed if it is approached with a positive and forgiving mindset. It is a tool for support, not a measure of your worth.

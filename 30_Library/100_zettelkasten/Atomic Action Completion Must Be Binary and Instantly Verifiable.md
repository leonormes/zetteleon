## Atomic Action Completion Must Be Binary and Instantly Verifiable

**Summary:** A core property of an atomic action is that its completion must be binary (either 0 or 1) and instantly verifiable, with no "partially done" states.

**Details:** This ensures clarity and prevents ambiguity about whether a task is finished. It allows for immediate feedback and accurate tracking of progress.

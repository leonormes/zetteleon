Numbers are not the symbols we use to write them; they are the abstract concepts those symbols represent. This is the foundational idea of [[Number vs Numeral]].

The dominant mental model for this is viewing [[Numbers as Abstract Objects (Platonism)]], where a number like '7' is the abstract property of "sevenness." This concept has intrinsic features, meaning the [[Properties of Numbers Are Inherent]] and are discovered, not invented.

This view extends beyond simple counting. Many numbers are [[Mathematical Constants as Fundamental Ratios and Processes]], such as $\pi$ or $e$.

For the entire concept of counting to be meaningful, a fundamental precondition of the universe must be met: [[Discreteness as a Precondition for Counting]]. This can be explored via [[The Continuum Thought Experiment]]. This foundational requirement is formalised in mathematics, as [[Set Theory Requires Distinct Objects]].

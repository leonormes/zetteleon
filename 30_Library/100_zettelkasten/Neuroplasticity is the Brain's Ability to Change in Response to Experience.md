## Neuroplasticity is the Brain's Ability to Change in Response to Experience

**Summary:** Neuroplasticity is the brain's fundamental capacity to change its physical structure and function in response to experience, which forms the physical basis of all learning and memory.

**Details:** Learning is a physical alteration in the brain. This plasticity manifests in several ways, including the formation of new connections between neurons (synaptogenesis) and the strengthening or weakening of existing synapses. Active learning strategies directly influence these neuroplastic processes.

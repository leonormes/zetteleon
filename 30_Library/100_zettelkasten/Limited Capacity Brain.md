Working memory has several key limitations, primarily its small capacity and short duration. It can typically hold only about three or four pieces of information at a time.

The brain is not designed for recall, and has a limited capacity for remembering things in detail.

The brain also has a tendency to make things fit by connecting unrelated episodes to convincing narratives, often resulting in inaccurate memories.

The brain is also limited in its ability to pay attention, with a "window of consciousness" lasting only about seven seconds. In short, the brain is a "machine for jumping to conclusions".

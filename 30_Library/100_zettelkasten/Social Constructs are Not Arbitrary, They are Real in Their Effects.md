## Social Constructs Are Not Arbitrary, They Are Real in Their Effects

**Summary:** Social constructs should be reframed not as "arbitrary" and meaningless, but as "contingent" or "constructed" systems that are real and powerful in their effects.

**Details:** While constructs like money, language, or laws are not "true" in the same way as physical laws, they are not random. They have rules, history, and immense real-world consequences that cannot be ignored. Recognizing that these systems are constructed, rather than objectively true, does not diminish their power; it highlights that their reality is built on collective participation and belief.

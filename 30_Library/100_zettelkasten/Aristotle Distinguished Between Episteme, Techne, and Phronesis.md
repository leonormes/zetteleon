## Aristotle Distinguished Between Episteme, Techne, and Phronesis

**Summary:** Aristotle created a tripartite distinction between three forms of knowledge: *episteme* (scientific/theoretical knowledge), *techne* (craft/technical skill), and *phronesis* (practical wisdom).

**Details:** These three forms of knowledge correspond to different modes of human activity: *theoria* (contemplation), *poiesis* (making/production), and *praxis* (action). Aristotle emphasized that practical wisdom (*phronesis*) and virtue could not be purely theoretical; they required practice and experience to be fully realized. This places action as a prerequisite for a complete understanding of practical matters.

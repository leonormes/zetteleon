## The Core Principles of Time Boxing Are Fixed Time Allocation a Goal-Oriented Approach and Commitment to Focus

**Summary:** The practice of time boxing is guided by three foundational ideas: allocating a fixed time, adopting a goal-oriented approach, and committing to focused work.

**Details:**
1.  **Fixed Time Allocation:** Each task is assigned a specific and limited duration, which is treated as a firm deadline.
2.  **Goal-Oriented Approach:** Before starting, a clear, specific objective for the session is defined.
3.  **Focus and Commitment:** The individual commits to working diligently and without distraction for the entire timebox.
4.  **Review and Iteration:** Progress is assessed at the end of the timebox to inform future planning.

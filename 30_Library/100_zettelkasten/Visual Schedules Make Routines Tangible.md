To make a routine more concrete and reduce the cognitive load of remembering it, use visual schedules and planning aids. These tools transfer the routine from internal memory to an external, visible format.

This can be a physical chart, a whiteboard, or a digital app. The key is that the routine becomes something you can see, not just something you have to recall. This is particularly helpful for individuals with executive function challenges, as it provides a tangible reference point throughout the day, making it easier to initiate tasks and transition between them.

Visual reminders also apply to creative projects and long-term work. Keeping visual representations of a project—such as mind maps, sketches, diagrams, or brief summaries—in visible workspace locations helps reignite connection to the work's bigger picture when returning after breaks. This addresses the challenge of losing mental models between work sessions.

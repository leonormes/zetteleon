## Shiny Object Syndrome Reflects ADHD Novelty Seeking

**Summary:** The ADHD tendency to constantly switch systems stems from dopamine-driven [[Novelty Seeking in ADHD Provides Dopamine Regulation|novelty seeking]] rather than dissatisfaction. This is a manifestation of [[Why Importance and Rewards Fail to Motivate ADHD Brains]] and the underlying [[Executive Function Challenges are Central to ADHD]].

**Pattern:**
1. New system provides a [[ADHD habit building requires immediate feedback or reward loops|dopamine rush]].
2. Implementation requires routine work, which often lacks novelty.
3. Novelty fades, motivation drops, leading to a struggle to maintain [[Structure conserves cognitive energy for neurodivergent brains|consistent structure]].
4. Search for a new "shiny" system begins, often leading to [[The Danger of Perpetual System-Building]].

**Management Strategies:**
- Build novelty into existing systems, perhaps through [[Designed Task Switching Leverages Dopamine Boosts for ADHD Motivation]].
- Limit exposure to new tools and focus on mastering existing ones.
- Separate exploration from implementation, dedicating specific time for novelty without disrupting core workflows.

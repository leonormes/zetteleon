title: LLMs mimic human conversational patterns

LLM responses often feel validating because they successfully mimic the patterns of human understanding we have learnt to expect throughout our lives.

When a person understands us, they tend to:

- Summarise our points.
- Ask relevant follow-up questions.
- Connect our ideas to broader concepts.
- Reflect our own language.

Because an LLM's output exhibits these patterns, it triggers the same cognitive response as a conversation with an understanding human. This is reinforced when the [[Coherent LLM output signals meaningful processing]], further solidifying the sense of being understood.

## Context Preservation Techniques Maintain Project Novelty and Meaning

**Summary:** Context preservation techniques are methods used to maintain a project's novelty, inspiration, and personal meaning over time, which helps in re-engaging with the work.

**Details:** These techniques go beyond technical documentation to capture the "why" behind the project. This can include keeping a "project story" to track the vision, maintaining a list of exciting future possibilities, and documenting personal connections to the work. These elements help rekindle the original inspiration.

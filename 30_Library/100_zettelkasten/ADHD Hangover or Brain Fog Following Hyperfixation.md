**Summary:** Following the crash from hyperfixation comes a period often described as an "ADHD hangover" or "brain fog"—a time when the brain feels fuzzy, bored, and under-stimulated, making it difficult to think clearly or initiate any tasks.

**Characteristics:**

**Mental Emptiness:**
- Having come down from the high of hyperfixation, the brain is now in a dopamine deficit
- Feelings of apathy, boredom, and lack of direction dominate
- Nothing seems interesting or engaging
- Motivation is absent or barely accessible

**Cognitive Fog:**
- Difficulty thinking clearly or making decisions
- Trouble initiating tasks, even simple ones
- Feeling mentally "underwater" or "fuzzy"
- Reduced processing speed and mental clarity
- Inability to focus on anything

**Emotional Impact:**
- Feelings of frustration and shame intensify
- Looking at remnants of the last hyperfixation (half-finished projects, purchased supplies, abandoned systems) evokes failure
- The stark contrast between previous passion and current apathy is deeply disheartening
- May experience low mood or depression-like symptoms

**Duration:**

This fallow period lasts until the brain, once again starved of stimulation, latches onto a new spark and the entire cycle begins anew. The duration varies but can last from hours to days or even weeks, depending on:

- Intensity and duration of the previous hyperfixation
- Individual neurochemistry
- Environmental factors and stress levels
- Availability of new novel stimuli

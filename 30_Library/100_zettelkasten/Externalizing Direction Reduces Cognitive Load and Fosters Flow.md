## Externalizing Direction Reduces Cognitive Load and Fosters Flow

**Summary:** By storing what needs to be done in an external system (e.g., checklists, calendars), you relieve working memory and reduce cognitive strain, making it easier to achieve a state of flow.

**Details:** When direction is externalized, you are not required to constantly decide what to do next. This reduces friction and allows your energy to move toward productive outcomes by default. Achievement becomes a matter of following a pre-defined path (flow) rather than exerting constant mental effort (force).

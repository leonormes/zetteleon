The "overthinking loop" is a cycle where individuals engage in more research, planning, and analysis in an attempt to find clarity. However, this process often has the opposite effect, leading to increased mental noise, a proliferation of options, and ultimately, inaction or paralysis.

This cycle is fueled by an addiction to theoretical information and a fear of real-world feedback.

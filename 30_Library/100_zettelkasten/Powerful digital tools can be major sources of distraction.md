Tools designed to enhance productivity, such as Obsidian, often have a paradoxical effect. Their powerful features, customisability, and non-linear nature can create endless opportunities for distraction. The user can get lost exploring the tool itself, rather than using it for its intended purpose of thinking and creating.

This is a form of [[Dopamine-Seeking Behavior The Research Rabbit Hole]], where the novelty of the tool provides more immediate gratification than the hard work of thinking.

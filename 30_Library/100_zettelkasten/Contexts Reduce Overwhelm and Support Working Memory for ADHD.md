## Contexts Reduce Overwhelm and Support Working Memory for ADHD

**Summary:** For individuals with ADHD, context tags dramatically reduce overwhelm by showing only relevant actions, support working memory by externalizing context requirements, and enable opportunistic action.

**Details:** Contexts help accommodate energy fluctuations by matching tasks to the current state (e.g., `@low_energy` tasks). This externalization of decision-making and filtering of options is crucial for managing executive function challenges.

## Individual Interpretation Creates Different Knowledge from the Same Information

**Summary:** Two people can create different 'knowledge' from the same information because knowledge formation is an active process of interpretation, not passive reception.

**Details:** Each person interprets information through the unique lens of their personal context, including their prior experiences, existing knowledge, cognitive patterns, and biases. This subjective filter influences how they understand, integrate, and make connections with new information, leading to different conclusions or applications even when starting from the identical source material.

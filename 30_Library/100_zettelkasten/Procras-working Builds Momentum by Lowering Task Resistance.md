title: Procras-working Builds Momentum by Lowering Task Resistance
type: strategy
uid:

Procras-working is the strategy of intentionally switching to a less daunting but still productive task when feeling stuck or resistant to a primary, high-priority task.

Instead of forcing a direct confrontation with the high-resistance item, you build momentum on something easier. This generates a sense of accomplishment and a small dopamine reward, which can then provide the cognitive and emotional fuel needed to circle back and tackle the original, more difficult task.

This technique productively channels the brain's natural tendency to seek the path of least resistance, distinguishing it from unproductive procrastination.

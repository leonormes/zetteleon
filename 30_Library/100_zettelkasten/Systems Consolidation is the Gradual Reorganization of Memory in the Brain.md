## Systems Consolidation is the Gradual Reorganization of Memory in the Brain

**Summary:** Systems consolidation is the gradual process by which memory traces are reorganized within the brain, becoming less dependent on the hippocampus and increasingly stored in the neocortex.

**Details:** Initially, new explicit memories are heavily dependent on the hippocampus. Over time, through a dialogue between the hippocampus and the neocortex (often via "neural replay" during rest or sleep), these memories are integrated into distributed networks in the neocortex, making them more stable and permanent.

Built-in flexibility within event-based routine structures naturally accommodates common ADHD behavioral patterns including task-switching impulses, extended hyperfocus episodes, and dopamine-seeking behavior, without requiring these patterns to be suppressed or creating guilt when they occur.

Rigid time-based schedules often conflict with ADHD neurology: a hyperfocus session on an interesting problem may extend well beyond its allocated time slot, derailing subsequent activities and creating shame. Event-based structures eliminate this conflict—the hyperfocus session completes, then the next anchored activity begins, preserving the routine sequence without forcing premature disengagement.

Similarly, when dopamine-seeking drives task-switching, the next activity in the routine can begin whenever the current distraction completes, maintaining forward momentum rather than abandoning structure entirely. This approach works with ADHD patterns rather than against them.

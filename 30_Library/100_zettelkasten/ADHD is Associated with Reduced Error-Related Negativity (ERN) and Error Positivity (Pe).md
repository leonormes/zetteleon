title: ADHD is Associated with Reduced Error-Related Negativity (ERN) and Error Positivity (Pe)
type: concept

Individuals with ADHD show abnormal error detection processes during tasks. This is characterized by a reduced error-related negativity (ERN) and a reduced error positivity (Pe).

The ERN is a brainwave that occurs about 50-100 ms after an incorrect response and reflects a rapid, internal error detection process. The Pe occurs about 300-500 ms after an error and is a marker for conscious error awareness. The attenuation of both in ADHD indicates impaired automatic error detection and diminished conscious processing of mistakes.

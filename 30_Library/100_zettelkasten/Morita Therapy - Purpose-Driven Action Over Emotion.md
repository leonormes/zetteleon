A key tenet of [[Morita Therapy]] is the emphasis on purpose-driven action. This means taking action based on what needs to be done in a given situation or what aligns with one's personal values, rather than waiting for the "right" emotional state.

This principle directly counters the tendency to procrastinate until one "feels like it." It is a practical strategy to break cycles of avoidance and paralysis. By prioritizing action over feeling, individuals learn that they can function and live meaningfully even in the presence of discomfort.

This directly challenges [[The Core Problem Confusing Preparation with Action]] and the paralysis of [[Perfectionism]], urging one to [[Abandon the Perfect]].

**Philosophical Parallel:**
Shares [[Existentialism - Existence Precedes Essence]] emphasis on:
- Action preceding clarity
- Commitment creating meaning
- Responsibility for choices

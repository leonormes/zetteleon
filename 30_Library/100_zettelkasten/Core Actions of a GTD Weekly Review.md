To fulfill [[The Purpose of a Weekly Review is to Restore Trust in Your System]], a "simplest viable" review must be completed. This process is one of the [[Core Principles of Sustainable ADHD Productivity]] because it externalizes executive functions, which is crucial for managing the challenges outlined in [[ADHD Brain Wiring vs. Classic Productivity Systems]].

The definition of done for a weekly review involves several key actions:

1. **Process Capture Locations to Zero**: Empty all physical and digital inboxes (email, task manager inbox, quick notes, etc.). This completes the "Capture" and "Clarify" stages of the GTD workflow.
2. **Define Next Actions**: Ensure every active project has at least one clearly defined, actionable next step. This is the critical step to move from "motion" to "action", as described in [[motion_vs_action|Motion Vs Action]].
3. **Review "Waiting For" List**: Check on items delegated to others and determine if follow-up is needed.
4. **Define the "Hard Landscape"**: Schedule key commitments and "big rocks" for the upcoming week on the calendar. This provides structure and makes time tangible.

When these actions are complete, the system is considered current, clear, and complete. This provides the foundation of trust needed for it to function effectively, which is especially important as [[Task Management Systems Have Limited Efficacy for ADHD Productivity]] without the backbone of a consistent review process.

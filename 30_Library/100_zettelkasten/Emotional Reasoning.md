Emotional reasoning occurs when an individual’s emotions dictate their perception of reality.

[[Your emotions are real but they are your responsibility]]

When we feel a strong emotion (like the sting of criticism or the deflation of a "burst bubble"), we might interpret that emotion as evidence of truth. If someone's disagreement makes you feel small or wrong, you might unconsciously conclude that they are right and you are wrong, regardless of the logic.

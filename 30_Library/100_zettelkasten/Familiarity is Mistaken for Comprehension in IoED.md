title: Familiarity is Mistaken for Comprehension in IoED

The core mechanism of the [[Illusion of Explanatory Depth (IoED)]] is the confusion between recognition and recall, or familiarity and true comprehension. When we are familiar with the terms and general outline of a concept, our mind takes this as a signal that we possess a deep understanding.

We mistake these surface-level cues for genuine explanatory knowledge, leading to an overestimation of our expertise. This is a type of [[Thinking Patterns, Biases, and Heuristics in Development|heuristic]] where we confuse [[What is information|information]] with [[Knowledge Corpus|knowledge]] and fail to build robust [[Mental Models The Developer's Internal Compass|mental models]].

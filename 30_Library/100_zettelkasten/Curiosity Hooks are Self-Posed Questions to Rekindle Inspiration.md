## Curiosity Hooks Are Self-Posed Questions to Rekindle Inspiration

**Summary:** "Curiosity hooks" are questions, challenges, or interesting problems that you intentionally leave for your future self to explore, serving to rekindle inspiration and engagement.

**Details:** These are not necessarily critical-path tasks, but rather interesting avenues for exploration. Examples could be "What if we tried using X technology here?" or "How could I simplify this component?". Reviewing these hooks can make returning to the project feel like an opportunity for discovery rather than a chore.

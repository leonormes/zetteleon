## Zen Practice Centers on Accepting Impermanence

**Summary:** A central tenet of Zen practice is the acceptance that everything, including oneself, is in a constant state of change.

**Details:** Suffering arises from trying to cling to fixed identities, ideas, or outcomes in a world that is inherently impermanent. Relief and peace come not from achieving stability, but from recognizing and embracing the continuous flow of change. This involves letting go of attachment to how things *should* be and accepting them as they are in the present moment.

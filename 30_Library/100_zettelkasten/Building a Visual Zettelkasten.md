A Visual Zettelkasten is built by creating a network of visual notes.

1. **Create Atomic Visuals**: Start with individual drawings representing single concepts.
2. **Use an Idea Integration Board**: Place related drawings onto a single, larger Excalidraw canvas. This acts as a map of related ideas.
3. **Link and Embed**: Use image embeds or links to the `.excalidraw` files to create this map.
4. **Grow the Network**: Gradually expand this network of visual notes. Zsolt Viczián calls this a *Serendipity Machine* when ideas are linked in this way.

The key is playful progress, not visual perfection. Start small and let the network evolve.

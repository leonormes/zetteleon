This collection of notes explores the Stoic concept of perception, centered on the crucial distinction between two ways of seeing the world: the "observing eye" and the "perceiving eye."

This is the core of [[The Discipline of Perception (Stoicism)]], a practice aimed at maintaining composure and clarity.

- **The Observing Eye (Strong):** Sees simply what is there; the objective facts of a situation (e.g., "This happened").
- **The Perceiving Eye (Weak):** Sees more than what is there, adding subjective judgment and emotional baggage (e.g., "This happened, *and it is bad*").

The core problem is that our [[Perception is Subjective Judgment]], which is the root cause of much of our distress. To strengthen the observing eye, one can use several [[Techniques for Objective Perception]].

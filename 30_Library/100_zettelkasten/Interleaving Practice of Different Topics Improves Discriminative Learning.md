## Interleaving Practice of Different Topics Improves Discriminative Learning

**Summary:** Interleaving is a study strategy that involves mixing the practice of multiple different but related topics or skills within a single study session, in contrast to practicing one topic completely before moving to the next (blocked practice).

**Details:** Interleaving forces the brain to continually retrieve and apply different problem-solving strategies, which improves the ability to differentiate between similar concepts. While it often feels more difficult during practice (a "desirable difficulty"), it leads to superior long-term retention and greater transfer of skills to new problems.

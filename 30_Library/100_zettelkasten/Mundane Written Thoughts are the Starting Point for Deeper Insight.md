## Mundane Written Thoughts Are the Starting Point for Deeper Insight

**Summary:** Thoughts that appear mundane or ordinary when first written should not be viewed as failures, but as the essential raw material for the process of clarification and refinement.

**Details:** The initial written draft is rarely the final, polished thought. Its value lies in providing a concrete starting point. By treating this mundane output as the beginning of an exploration, one can begin to elaborate, add detail, ask clarifying questions, and connect it to other ideas. This iterative process of refining the mundane is how simple observations are developed into more complex and meaningful insights.

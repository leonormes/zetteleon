## Spaced Repetition Strengthens Memory Through Timed Review

**Summary:** Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at gradually increasing intervals to optimize memory retention and combat the forgetting curve.

**How it works:**
1. First review: Immediately after learning
2. Subsequent reviews: At increasing intervals (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month)
3. Adjust timing based on recall accuracy

**Benefits:**
- More efficient than massed practice (cramming)
- Moves information from short-term to long-term memory
- Supported by digital tools like Anki or physical flashcard systems

**Scientific basis:**
- Leverages the psychological spacing effect
- Aligns with the brain's natural memory consolidation processes

## MOC - Project Continuity

> **Inclusion criteria:** Atomic only; must be evergreen or growing.

From a cognitive perspective, deep engagement in creative work is a "flow state." For someone with ADHD, these states can be particularly intense and productive. The challenge comes when you try to re-enter this state later, as explained by the concept that [[Project Re-Entry is Challenging Due to Diminished Novelty]]. This is because the project no longer provides the same novelty-driven dopamine release that [[Flow State is a State of Optimal Dopamine Stimulation|flow states provide]].

Here’s a structured approach to building bridges between these work sessions:

### 1. End-of-Session Documentation

When you’re still in that flow state, take 10-15 minutes to create a [[A Future Self Brief Aids Reconnection with a Project's Thought Process|Future Self Brief]]. This isn’t just standard documentation; it’s specifically designed to help reconnect with your thought process by recording excitement, mental models, decision points, and unfinished threads.

### 2. Visual Thinking Tools

Since a clear mental model is present during active work, it's valuable to use [[Visual Thinking Tools Preserve Project Mental Models]]. This can involve creating quick mind maps, sketches with color-coding, or even recording a voice memo to explain the visualization.

### 3. Momentum-Based Re-Entry Points

Instead of trying to dive back in at the deep end, it's effective to create multiple "shallow" entry points. This is the core idea behind [[Momentum-Based Re-Entry Points Ease Project Resumption]]. A key tactic here is [[Leaving a Task Intentionally Unfinished Creates a Clear Starting Point]], which gives your future self an obvious place to begin. You can also create a [[A Project Playlist is a Sequence of Small Tasks to Rebuild Momentum|project playlist]] to help rebuild momentum.

### 4. Context Preservation

To help maintain the project’s novelty and personal meaning, employ [[Context Preservation Techniques Maintain Project Novelty and Meaning]]. This can be done by keeping a [[A Project Story Tracks a Project's Evolving Vision|project story]] that tracks your evolving vision and breakthrough moments. It is also useful to create [[Curiosity Hooks are Self-Posed Questions to Rekindle Inspiration|curiosity hooks]] to challenge yourself and rekindle inspiration.

### 5. Environmental Anchors

Use environmental cues to help rebuild your mental context. [[Environmental Anchors Help Rebuild Project-Specific Mental Context|Environmental anchors]] can be a specific workspace or a brief [[A Startup Ritual Eases the Transition into a Project Mindset|startup ritual]] that helps you re-enter the project mindset.

### 6. Dopamine-Aware Planning

Work with your brain’s reward system through [[Dopamine-Aware Planning Aligns Tasks with the Brain's Reward System]]. This involves building in small, frequent wins and creating a “progress visualization” that makes small steps feel meaningful.

### Conclusion

The goal isn’t to perfectly recreate your initial flow state, but to build reliable bridges that make it easier to re-engage with your work meaningfully. Each time you successfully return to a project, you are [[Successfully Re-engaging with a Project Builds Momentum for Future Continuity|building evidence that counters the “start fresh” impulse]], making it easier to maintain continuity in the future.

Combining structure with flexibility satisfies the dual needs of neurodivergent individuals—particularly those with co-occurring autism and ADHD—by providing the predictable framework that reduces anxiety while allowing the adaptation capacity that prevents rigidity-induced failure.

Autistic individuals often crave routine predictability because it creates a stable, comprehensible environment that reduces cognitive and sensory overwhelm. However, ADHD introduces variable attention, motivation, and energy that makes rigid adherence to fixed schedules difficult or impossible.

Multi-tier routine systems resolve this apparent contradiction: the structure (the sequence of activities, the routine framework) remains consistent and predictable, while the intensity and duration (which tier you use) flexes with current capacity. You always know what comes next, but you don't have to execute it at a fixed level of completeness.

This approach transforms routines from fragile constructs that shatter when conditions aren't perfect into resilient frameworks that bend without breaking, accommodating the reality of neurodivergent nervous systems.

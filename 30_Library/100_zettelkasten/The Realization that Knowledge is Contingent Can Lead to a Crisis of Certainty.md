## The Realization that Knowledge is Contingent Can Lead to a Crisis of Certainty

**Summary:** The intellectual turning point of realizing that our knowledge is built on social constructs, cognitive biases, and contingent foundations can be deeply unsettling, leading to a suspicion of all certainty.

**Details:** This experience can feel like losing the ground you stand on, making it difficult to feel confident in your beliefs. It stems from dismantling a worldview based on the assumption that being "objectively right" is possible and necessary. The error is not in the analysis itself, but in the prior assumption that objective rightness is the only valid foundation for confidence and action.

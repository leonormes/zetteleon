Contextual myopia is a cognitive state where an individual's immediate environment and circumstances create a narrow "focus bubble". This bubble restricts a person's attention, causing them to prioritise local concerns, tasks, and stimuli over more distant or abstract goals. The physical, social, and emotional context one is in dictates what seems important, often to the exclusion of the bigger picture.

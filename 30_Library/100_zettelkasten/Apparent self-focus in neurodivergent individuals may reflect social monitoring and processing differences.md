title: Apparent self-focus in neurodivergent individuals may reflect social monitoring and processing differences
type: concept

For neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with ADHD and RSD, what may appear to others as self-focused behavior can actually stem from different underlying mechanisms:

1. **Intense monitoring of social interactions** - Hypervigilance aimed at avoiding rejection or criticism
2. **Different information processing** - Processing sensory or social information through alternative pathways
3. **Need for extended recovery time** - Requiring more time to recover from social interactions due to higher cognitive load

These internal experiences create behaviors that may be misinterpreted as self-centeredness when they actually reflect the neurodivergent person's attempt to manage their experience and avoid overwhelming distress.

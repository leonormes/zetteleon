ExcaliBrain integrates with Excalidraw to turn your Obsidian vault into a dynamic, navigable mind map.

## Setup

1. Install the **Excalidraw**, **ExcaliBrain**, and **Dataview** plugins.
2. Define relationships in your notes using frontmatter (e.g., `Parent:: [[Projects]]`) or standard wikilinks. ExcaliBrain understands parent, child, sibling, and friend relationships.

## Workflow

1. Open the ExcaliBrain panel from the ribbon.
2. It displays the active note in the center, with related notes arranged around it based on their defined relationships.
3. Clicking any node in the ExcaliBrain graph centers it, allowing you to traverse your knowledge graph visually.
4. The map updates in real-time as you edit your notes and their links.

ExcaliBrain treats `.excalidraw` files as regular notes, so your visual sketches are included as nodes in the mind map. This creates a powerful hybrid workflow combining freeform drawing with structured, auto-generated mind maps.

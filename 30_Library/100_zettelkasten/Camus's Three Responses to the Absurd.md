After diagnosing [[Camus and the Absurd|the Absurd]], Albert Camus was most concerned with how one should live with this realization. He saw three possible responses:

1. Physical Suicide: To end one's life. Camus rejects this, arguing it is a capitulation to the Absurd, an escape rather than an answer.
2. Philosophical Suicide (The Leap of Faith): To deny the Absurd by adopting a ready-made belief system that provides ultimate meaning (e.g., a religion or a rigid ideology). This involves abandoning reason to take a "leap of faith" into a comforting narrative. Camus rejects this as a dishonest evasion of the truth.
3. Revolt: The only honest and dignified response. Revolt consists of living with full awareness of the Absurd, refusing both suicide and the false comfort of a leap of faith. It means realizing that in a universe with no ultimate rules, one is completely free. The value of life is found not in some future salvation, but in the quantity and quality of experiences lived now. One rebels against the meaningless cosmos by living as passionately and fully as possible.

This is famously illustrated in [[The Myth of Sisyphus as an Absurd Hero]].

This concept is derived from the broader conversation in [[Contextual Myopia and Human Behavior]].

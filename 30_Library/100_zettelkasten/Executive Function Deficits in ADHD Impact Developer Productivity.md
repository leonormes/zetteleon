## Executive Function Deficits in ADHD Impact Developer Productivity

**Summary:** Adult ADHD impairs productivity in software development through core deficits in executive functions, including task initiation, time management, focus regulation, and working memory.

**Details:** These challenges are not due to a lack of skill but stem from neurobiological differences in self-regulation. In software engineering, this manifests as difficulty starting projects, estimating timelines, maintaining consistent focus, and retaining critical information during complex tasks. These impairments are rooted in variations in the brain's goal-directed behavior systems.

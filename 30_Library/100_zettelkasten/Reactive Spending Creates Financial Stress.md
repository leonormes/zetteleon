title: Reactive Spending Creates Financial Stress

Reactive spending, the 'spend-first, categorize-later' approach, is a primary source of financial anxiety. Without a proactive plan, every purchase requires complex mental math against a single checking account balance, creating constant, low-grade stress.

This method obscures the fundamental scarcity of money and prevents clear decision-making. It only reveals where money *went*, not where it is *going*, making it impossible to align spending with long-term goals. It is the direct opposite of proactive budgeting, as described in [[Give Every Dollar a Job (YNAB Rule 1)]].

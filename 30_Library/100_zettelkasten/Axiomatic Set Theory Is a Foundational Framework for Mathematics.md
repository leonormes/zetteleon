**Summary:** Axiomatic set theory, particularly the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (ZF) with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), serves as the primary foundational framework for modern mathematics, providing a rigorous basis for defining all mathematical objects.

**Details:**

Set theory serves as the "raw material" from which mathematical structures are built. A structure can be formally defined as a set (or sets) endowed with some relations or operations.

**Key Features:**

- **Universal language:** Nearly all mathematical objects can be constructed from sets (numbers, functions, spaces)
- **Explicit axioms:** ZF/ZFC explicitly state what operations on sets are valid, avoiding paradoxes
- **Foundational depth:** Provides a common framework for diverse mathematical fields

**Historical Context:**

Modern axiomatic set theory arose in response to paradoxes discovered in naive set theory (like Russell's Paradox). By carefully axiomatizing which set-forming operations are permitted, mathematicians created a consistent foundation.

**Relation to Structure:** Sets provide the basic "grouping" mechanism needed to define any pattern or structure, making set theory naturally foundational to the structuralist view of mathematics.

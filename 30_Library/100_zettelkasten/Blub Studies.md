Blub studies refers to the deep dive into the inner workings of everyday, mundane software tools and systems that programmers use, like programming languages, frameworks, databases, and version control systems.

This concept challenges the common assumption that learning exotic technologies is more valuable than mastering familiar ones. Instead of pursuing novelty, blub studies advocates for developing deep expertise in the tools you already use daily.

## Core Principles

**Depth Over Breadth:** Rather than collecting superficial knowledge of many technologies, blub studies emphasizes building comprehensive understanding of existing tools. This connects to how [[Flawed Mental Models Limit Mastery]] - shallow understanding creates capability ceilings that prevent true expertise.

**Transferable Learning:** The principles learned through deep tool mastery are often generalizable across technologies. Understanding one database deeply provides insights applicable to others, similar to how [[Mental Models The Developer's Internal Compass|mental models]] help developers navigate complex systems.

**Practical Value:** [[Mundane Tools Value|Mastering mundane tools]] can significantly improve effectiveness, often more than learning trendy new technologies. This reflects the difference between [[Applicative maths is the use of pre-discovered patterns as tools|applicative knowledge]] (using existing tools expertly) and always seeking new patterns.

## Relationship to Learning

Blub studies represents a form of [[Conventional Problem Solving]] that builds expertise through systematic exploration of familiar systems. It's the programming equivalent of becoming a master craftsperson rather than a dilettante.

The approach also relates to [[The Extended Mind Thesis]] - by deeply understanding our tools, we effectively extend our cognitive capabilities through intimate familiarity with our technological environment.

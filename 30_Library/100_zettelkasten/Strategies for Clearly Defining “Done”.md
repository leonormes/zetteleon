## Why Pre-Define “Done”

ADHD brains are prone to scope creep and perfectionism. Without a clear endpoint, tasks can expand endlessly, making it hard to finish or even start. Defining “done” before you begin provides structure and a sense of achievement.

## Practical Techniques

**a. Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**
Ask, “What is the smallest version of this task that would count as complete?” For example, “Send a draft email, even if it’s not perfect.”

**b. SMART Criteria:**
Make tasks Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
Example: Instead of “work on project,” try “write 200 words of the project report by 3pm.”

**c. Deliverable-Focused Mindset:**
Define what you will have in your hands when you’re done—a document, a clean desk, a sent email.

**d. Work Backwards:**
Start with the end goal and break it into interim “done” states.
Example: “Final report” → “Draft report” → “Outline report.”

**e. Checklists for Recurring Tasks:**
Create a checklist for tasks you do often (e.g., “clean room”: make bed, clear desk, vacuum floor).

## Examples

- Vague: “Work on project.”
  Defined: “Create a bullet-point outline for the project introduction.”

- Vague: “Clean room.”
  Defined: “Pick up clothes, put rubbish in bin, wipe desk.”

## Managing Perfectionism

Remind yourself: “Done is better than perfect.” A clear definition of “done” helps you stop when the task is complete, not when it’s perfect.

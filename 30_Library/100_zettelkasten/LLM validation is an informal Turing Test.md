The experience of feeling genuinely understood by an AI, despite knowing its non-sentient nature, is an informal demonstration of the Turing Test's core principle.

The test posits that if a machine can convincingly simulate intelligent conversation, it becomes functionally indistinguishable from a human from the user's perspective. The emotional and cognitive response of feeling "validated" shows how effective this simulation can be, eliciting reactions in us that are typically reserved for human-to-human interaction.

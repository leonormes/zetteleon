Bookend routines are anchor points placed at the beginning and end of each day that provide structure and consistency to the overall daily rhythm. Typically consisting of morning and evening sequences, these routines act as stable "containers" that bracket the more flexible middle portions of the day.

The morning bookend might include activities like waking up, exercise, breakfast, journaling, and planning the day. The evening bookend typically involves hygiene tasks, relaxation activities, and wind-down rituals that signal the transition to rest.

These bookends serve multiple functions: they create predictable starts and ends to the day, reduce decision fatigue during vulnerable low-energy periods, and provide psychological closure and preparation that support better sleep and more focused daytime functioning.

Once people commit to a position or a course of action, even in a small way, they feel internal and external pressure to behave consistently with that commitment. The more effort, time, or emotion they invest (sunk costs), the more they will rationalise its importance to justify the investment.

In an argument, for example, individuals may refuse to back down not because of the issue's importance, but because they have invested their ego and must now see it through, manufacturing reasons why it is a vital matter of principle. This reinforces the bubble of [[Contextual Myopia and Goal Displacement]].

This concept is derived from the broader conversation in [[SoT - Contextual Myopia and Human Behavior]].

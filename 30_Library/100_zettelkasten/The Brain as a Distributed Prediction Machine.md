Neuroscience reveals that mental models are not located in a single, neat part of the brain. Instead, they are **distributed and emergent properties** of the brain's neural networks.

Different components of a model are stored in the brain regions responsible for processing that type of information. For example, your model of a "dog" involves coordinated activation across the visual, auditory, somatosensory, and emotional centers of your brain.

- The **hippocampus** is crucial for forming and consolidating these models, linking the disparate components together.
- The **prefrontal cortex** is vital for manipulating and simulating the models to make decisions and predictions.

Research using fMRI shows that when we imagine a scenario, our brain activity patterns closely mimic the patterns from when we actually experience it. This suggests the brain uses the same neural machinery to run these internal simulations as it does to perceive reality, which helps explain why [[Naïve Realism Makes Mental Models Invisible|our models and reality feel so blurred]].

This understanding of the brain as a distributed system is a core component of the modern theory of [[Predictive Processing and the Bayesian Brain]].

## The Rubber Band Metaphor for Change Capacity

**Summary:** When stretching our capacity for change too far, we experience a "snap-back" effect—returning to old patterns—like an overstretched rubber band that breaks or recoils.

**Details:** The rubber band metaphor illustrates that human capacity for change has natural limits. Just as a rubber band can only stretch so far before breaking or snapping back, attempting dramatic behavioral transformations creates unsustainable stress that leads to abandonment. When we push beyond our proximal zone of development, the discomfort becomes overwhelming, triggering a return to familiar, comfortable patterns. This isn't a character flaw but a predictable response to overextension. The solution is to stretch capacity gradually—just enough to feel growth without creating the conditions for snap-back.

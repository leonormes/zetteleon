title: Shame as Social Regulatory Mechanism
type: concept

Shame functions as a social regulatory emotion that evolved to:

- Promote group cohesion by discouraging behaviors that might harm the group
- Signal compliance with social norms
- Maintain social bonds by modifying behaviors that could lead to rejection

Unlike guilt (about specific actions - "I did something bad"), shame targets the self ("I am bad"), making it a particularly powerful social regulator.

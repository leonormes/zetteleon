## MOC - How To Create And Use Mini Routines

The Purple Ella video "How To Create And Use Mini Routines (Autism, ADHD, Chronic Illness)" presents a flexible, neurodivergent-friendly alternative to rigid daily scheduling through the use of "mini routines" and personalized daily rhythms.

### Core Concept: Mini Routines & Rhythms

[[Mini routines are event-triggered sequences rather than time-based schedules]], providing a lightweight alternative to strict scheduling. This approach helps [[Routines reduce anxiety and decision fatigue in neurodivergent individuals]], [[Mini routines improve consistency through flexible adaptation]] to energy levels, motivation changes, and unexpected events.

### Practical Steps for Implementation

The implementation strategy builds on several interconnected concepts:

Start by identifying [[Bookend routines mark the start and end of day]] (e.g., morning and evening routines). These provide stable anchors at the most vulnerable transition points.

Next, establish [[Event-based anchor points use activities as natural transitions]] rather than precise times. Examples include finishing breakfast, completing lunch, or ending a work session. This approach ensures [[Event-based structure reduces time-pressure anxiety]] since there's no need for constant clock-watching.

Between anchor points, split the day into flexible blocks. Adjust block length based on real-life events or energy patterns—this is where [[Event-based pacing matches boom and bust energy cycles]] becomes particularly valuable.

[[Mini routines can attach to common activities as reset points]] like meal breaks, rest periods, or essential chores. These act as natural "reset" opportunities throughout the day.

List weekly and daily tasks, then assign them flexibly to available blocks or plan each day during your morning review. Allow tasks to shift as needed—the structure accommodates rather than constrains.

Crucially, allow for rest, fun, special interests, and unplanned tasks. This built-in flexibility is essential.

### Example Mini Routine Sequence

A practical implementation might look like:

**Morning routine:** Wake up, exercise, breakfast, journaling, plan day, get dressed and washed

**Evening routine:** Hygiene, relaxing drink, pajamas, after dinner, wind-down activities

**Rest routine:** Always after lunch, attached to this anchor point

These examples demonstrate how sequences remain consistent while timing remains flexible.

### ADHD & Autism Benefits

The system provides multiple neurodivergent-friendly features:

[[Event-based pacing matches boom and bust energy cycles]], allowing high-energy periods to extend and low-energy periods to compress naturally.

[[Event-based structure reduces time-pressure anxiety]] by eliminating the need for constant clock-watching and the shame that comes from running "behind schedule."

[[Flexible routines accommodate hyperfocus and task-switching patterns]], recognizing that ADHD attention patterns are features to work with rather than bugs to suppress. When hyperfocus extends a task, the routine simply continues afterward rather than creating cascading failure.

### Daily Rhythm Template

Here is a practical shell for building your own rhythm:

**Bookend Routines**
- **Morning:** [personalize steps based on your needs]
- **Evening:** [personalize steps for wind-down]

**Anchor Points**
- After morning routine
- Lunch completion
- End of workday
- Dinner completion

**Time Blocks** (flexible duration)
- Breakfast → Lunch: [tasks/rest]
- Lunch → End of workday: [tasks/rest/errands]
- End of workday → Dinner: [personal projects]
- Dinner → Bedtime: [wind-down]

Adjust each block daily based on energy, commitments, and unforeseen needs.

### Key Insight

[[Mini routines are effective for ADHD autism and chronic illness]] precisely because they provide structure without rigidity or overwhelm. The framework guides behavior while remaining responsive to the significant day-to-day variations these conditions create. This is the fundamental value proposition: achieving consistency through flexibility rather than demanding perfection.

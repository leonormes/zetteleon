## Confirmation Bias Distorts Social Perception

**Summary:** Once a hypothesis about another person is formed ("they don't like me," "they're arrogant"), confirmation bias causes selective attention to cues that support that belief while ignoring or minimizing contradictory evidence.

**Details:**

- **Selective noticing**: When you believe someone dislikes you, you'll notice their brief frown but miss the five times they smiled or engaged positively
- **Interpretive bias**: Ambiguous behaviors are interpreted through the lens of existing beliefs—a neutral facial expression becomes "evidence" of dislike when the prior is negative
- **Memory distortion**: Past interactions are recalled selectively, with confirming instances strengthened and disconfirming ones forgotten or reframed
- **Self-reinforcing loop**: Each "confirmation" strengthens conviction, making the belief more resistant to correction and narrowing the range of cues attended to

**Social consequences:** Creates self-fulfilling prophecies (e.g., treating someone as hostile leads them to respond defensively, "confirming" your belief); prevents relationship repair; maintains false social models.

**Countermeasures:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence; ask trusted observers for reality checks; use hypothesis-testing frameworks rather than mind-reading.

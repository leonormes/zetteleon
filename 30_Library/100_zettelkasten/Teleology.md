Teleology is the philosophical idea that things have an inherent purpose, goal, or final cause (telos). It suggests that natural phenomena exist or occur for the sake of some end or purpose.

In teleological thinking, events and structures are explained by their ultimate purpose rather than their immediate causes. For example, a teleological explanation might say that birds have wings "in order to fly" rather than explaining wings through evolutionary processes.

## Historical Context

Teleological thinking was prominent in ancient philosophy, particularly in Aristotelian thought, where it was considered one of the four causes of explanation.

## Modern Scientific Rejection

Contemporary science, particularly evolutionary biology, has largely moved away from teleological explanations in favor of mechanistic and emergent explanations. This shift represents a fundamental change in how we understand natural phenomena.

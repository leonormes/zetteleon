The demand to be perfect is a trap. The idealized version of a project in one's mind is often unattainable, which can lead to a paralyzing feeling of inevitable failure. This is the core of [[Perfectionism]].

## Overcoming the Block

- The Vicious Cycle: This paralysis is often driven by [[The Shame-Procrastination Cycle]], where the fear of not meeting perfect standards leads to inaction, which in turn creates shame.
- A Tactical Antidote: A direct way to break this cycle is to [[Embrace Throwaway Thinking]]. Giving yourself permission to create something imperfect and disposable removes the pressure.
- A Practical Application: This principle is key to [[Getting Started with Zettelkasten with ADHD]], which emphasizes that the goal is to start connecting ideas, not to build a flawless system from day one.
- A Core Mindset Shift: The most powerful reframe is to see your work as [[Your Zettelkasten is a Mirror not a Monument]]. A mirror's job is to reflect reality, however messy, not to be a perfect, static object for admiration.
- The Underlying Principle: This all ties back to [[Radical Simplicity - The Don't Make Me Think Rule]]. Perfectionism adds immense cognitive friction; abandoning it is the ultimate act of making things simple enough to start.
- [[Morita Therapy - Purpose-Driven Action Over Emotion]] emphasizes action over waiting for perfect conditions.

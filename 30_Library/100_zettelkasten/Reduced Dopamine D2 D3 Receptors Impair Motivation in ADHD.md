A key neurobiological mechanism underlying task initiation difficulties in ADHD is the dysfunction of the dopamine reward pathway. PET imaging studies have found significantly reduced dopamine D2/D3 receptors in the nucleus accumbens and midbrain. This hypofunction means that tasks, especially those lacking intrinsic interest, fail to trigger sufficient neurotransmitter activity to generate motivational drive.

## Medication Provides a Foundational Layer for ADHD Management

**Summary:** Medication is a transformative intervention for many with ADHD, providing the necessary cognitive stability to successfully implement and sustain other behavioral strategies and productivity systems.

**Details:** By modulating dopamine and norepinephrine pathways, medication addresses the neurobiological roots of ADHD, improving impulse control, sustained attention, and motivation. It does not teach skills but acts as a catalyst, providing the mental clarity and energy required to execute learned strategies for organization and planning. Its effectiveness is maximized when combined with therapies like CBT and personalized coping mechanisms.

title: Signs of higher-than-typical self-focus include conversation domination and poor memory for others

Several behavioral patterns may indicate self-focus levels that exceed typical social norms:

1. **Consistently steering conversations back to personal experiences** - Redirecting discussions to one's own stories repeatedly
2. **Difficulty remembering details about others' lives** - Struggling to retain information others have shared
3. **Rarely initiating contact except when needing something** - Only reaching out when requiring assistance
4. **Difficulty understanding perspectives different from one's own** - Struggling to adopt alternative viewpoints

These patterns, when persistent across contexts, may suggest higher-than-typical self-focus that could affect relationship quality.

title: The Aha Moment as a Dopamine Reward
type:

The feeling of cleverness experienced when grasping a new concept is a biological reward mechanism. When a new piece of information is successfully connected to existing knowledge (an "Aha!" moment), the brain releases a small burst of dopamine.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, motivation, and reward. This system evolved to encourage behaviours beneficial for survival, including understanding the world.

This feeling is not a comparative assessment against others, but rather an internal signal from the brain that you have successfully updated your own mental model of reality. It is the brain's way of saying, "Keep doing that."

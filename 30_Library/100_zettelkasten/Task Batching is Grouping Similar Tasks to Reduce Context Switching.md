## Task Batching is Grouping Similar Tasks to Reduce Context Switching

**Summary:** Task batching is a productivity strategy that involves grouping similar tasks together to be completed in a single, dedicated time block.

**Details:** This method is highly effective at minimizing context switching—the mental effort and time lost when shifting between different types of tasks. By focusing on one type of activity (e.g., responding to all emails at once, running all errands in one trip), efficiency is improved and decision fatigue is reduced. It is an explicit form of time blocking.

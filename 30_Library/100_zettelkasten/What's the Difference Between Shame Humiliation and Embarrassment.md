While shame, humiliation, and embarrassment are all uncomfortable emotions that involve a sense of self-consciousness, they have distinct differences in their core nature, focus, and cause.

[[Shame]]

[[Humiliation]]

[[Embarrasment]]

Here's a table summarising the key distinctions:

| Feature           | Shame                                            | Humiliation                                             | Embarrassment                                 |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Focus** | Negative self-evaluation, feeling inherently bad | Lowering of social status, loss of dignity              | Socially awkward or unacceptable behaviour    |
| **Source**        | Internal self-appraisal                          | Inflicted by others or external circumstances           | Often self-inflicted through a social misstep |
| **Intensity**     | Often deep, painful, and long-lasting            | Can be intense and deeply upsetting                     | Usually milder and more temporary             |
| **Core Feeling**  | Worthlessness, defectiveness                     | Being unjustly debased, loss of respect                 | Awkwardness, social discomfort                |
| **Public Aspect** | Can be private or public                         | Often public or involves an audience (real or imagined) | Usually involves being witnessed by others    |

In essence:

- You feel **shame** when you believe *you are* bad.
- You feel **humiliation** when you feel *others have unjustly made you appear* bad or insignificant.
- You feel **embarrassment** when you believe *you have done something* awkward or socially unacceptable.

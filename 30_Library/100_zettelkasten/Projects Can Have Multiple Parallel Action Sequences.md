## Projects Can Have Multiple Parallel Action Sequences

**Summary:** In complex projects, multiple parallel action sequences can exist, allowing different parts of the project to progress concurrently.

**Details:** While some actions must complete in a specific order (sequences), other parts of a project can be worked on simultaneously. For example, a product launch might have concurrent Development, Marketing, and Legal sequences, each with its own set of actionable "head" tasks.

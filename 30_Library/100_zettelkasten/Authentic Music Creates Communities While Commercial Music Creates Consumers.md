## Authentic Music Creates Communities While Commercial Music Creates Consumers

**Summary:** A key insight into the function of music is that authentic, "ground-up" music tends to create communities, whereas commercial, "top-down" music tends to create consumers.

**Details:** When people gather for authentic music, they are participating in a shared cultural moment and connecting with each other. They are part of the event. Commercial music, designed for mass consumption, often positions the listener as a passive consumer of a product, which is a more isolating and transactional relationship.

## Mind-Reading Fallacy and Projection

**Summary:** The mind-reading fallacy is the cognitive error of treating inferred mental states ("they think I'm boring") as factual knowledge, often amplified by projection—unconsciously attributing one's own internal states to others.

**Details:**

- **Inference vs. fact confusion**: Social cues require interpretation; treating interpretations as certain knowledge collapses epistemic uncertainty and prevents reality-testing
- **Projection mechanism**: When feeling insecure, anxious, or critical of self, these internal states are projected onto others—"I feel awkward" becomes "they think I'm awkward"
- **Confirmation loop**: Mind-reading generates predictions ("they'll reject me"), which influence behavior (withdrawn, defensive), potentially creating the outcome feared
- **Privileged access illusion**: We have direct access to our own thoughts but only indirect cues about others'; this asymmetry is underweighted, leading to false confidence in inferences

**Corrective practices:**

- Shift from certainty ("they hate me") to hypothesis ("I observed X, one explanation is Y")
- Generate multiple alternative explanations for ambiguous behavior
- Directly ask (when appropriate): "How did that land for you?" rather than assuming
- Notice correlation between internal state and social judgments—anxiety amplifies negative mind-reading

**Related to metacognition:** Like the [[Illusion of Explanatory Depth (IoED)]], mind-reading represents a failure of metacognition—mistaking a mental model for reality without recognizing its inferential nature.

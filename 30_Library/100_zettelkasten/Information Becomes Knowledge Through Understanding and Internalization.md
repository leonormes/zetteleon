## Information Becomes Knowledge Through Understanding and Internalization

**Summary:** Information transforms into knowledge when an individual comprehends its meaning and context, integrates it with their existing understanding, and internalizes it into their cognitive framework.

**Details:** This process requires deeper engagement than simple memorization of facts. It is the act of making external information a part of one's own mental landscape, connecting it to what is already known and understood.

## The Framework Solves Task Initiation Difficulties

**Summary:** The atomic action framework effectively solves task initiation difficulties by providing clear next actions and leveraging starter tasks.

**Details:** By breaking down large tasks into the smallest possible physical steps, and by using starter tasks to overcome the initial inertia, the framework removes ambiguity and lowers the activation energy required to begin. This directly addresses the neurological barriers to task initiation.

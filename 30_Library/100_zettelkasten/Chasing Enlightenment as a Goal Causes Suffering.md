## Chasing Enlightenment as a Goal Causes Suffering

**Summary:** Chasing enlightenment as a fixed goal or permanent state traps people in suffering because it reinforces attachment to a specific outcome, a core source of suffering itself.

**Details:** According to Zen teacher Robert Waldinger, true liberation comes from letting go of the need for fixed outcomes or self-improvement projects. Enlightenment is not a destination to be reached but an ongoing, moment-by-moment recognition of reality. The pursuit of it as a future achievement creates a cycle of striving and dissatisfaction, which is the very state one seeks to escape.

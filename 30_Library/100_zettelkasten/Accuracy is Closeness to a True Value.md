Accuracy describes the closeness of a measurement to the true or accepted value. It is a measure of correctness and is primarily affected by systematic errors, which are consistent and repeatable issues like a miscalibrated scale.

For example, if a clock is consistently one minute fast, it is not accurate, even if it is precise. The goal is to minimize the difference between a measurement and the actual value. This concept is a fundamental part of building correct [[Mental Models The Developer's Internal Compass|mental models]] about systems and data.

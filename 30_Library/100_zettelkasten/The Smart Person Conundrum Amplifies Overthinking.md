Highly intelligent individuals can perceive a greater number of potential risks and negative outcomes for any given action. This heightened risk perception leads to increased hesitation and a stronger tendency to avoid real-world experiences ([[Type 2 Information is Experiential and Feared by Overthinkers]]).

This amplifies the [[The Overthinking Loop Creates Mental Noise Not Clarity]], as intelligence is used to generate more reasons for inaction rather than to find a path forward.

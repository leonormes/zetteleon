## Key Steps

The routine is a sequence of dominos, each one triggering the next:

1.  **Immediate Wake-Up:** [[Avoiding the Snooze Button Forces Physical Wakeup]] by placing your alarm out of reach.
2.  **High-Intensity Exercise:** A 4-minute session of HIIT, as [[Morning HIIT Boosts BDNF and Neuroplasticity]].
3.  **Cold Shower:** A 30-second cold shower, because [[Cold Showers Improve Immunity and Mood]].
4.  **Deep Work:** [[Perform Deep Work in a Supercharged Brain State]] for 5 minutes on your most important task.
5.  **The Optimized Reset:** This final domino has three parts:
    -   **Body:** A [[Low-Carb Raw Breakfast Supports Mental Clarity]].
    -   **Mind:** [[Sunlight and Nature Exposure Improves Executive Function]].
    -   **Spirit:** [[Gratitude Journaling Activates the Medial Prefrontal Cortex]].

## Science and Practical Notes

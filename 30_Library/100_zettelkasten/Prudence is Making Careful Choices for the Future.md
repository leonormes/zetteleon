Prudence is the virtue of making careful, considered choices with an eye toward the future.

It involves foresight, caution, and the ability to govern oneself by the use of reason. A prudent person thinks about the potential consequences of their actions before committing to a course.

This strength helps in avoiding unnecessary risks and making decisions that are beneficial in the long term.

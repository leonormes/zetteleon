Goal Displacement is a concept from organizational sociology that describes what happens when the original goals of an organization (the *ends*) are replaced by the rules, procedures, and processes that were meant to achieve them (the *means*).

A classic example is a development team that derives its sense of achievement from completing tasks and closing tickets (the means) rather than confirming that their work provides value to users (the end). They can feel successful even if the product is a failure.

This phenomenon connects to several cognitive patterns. It's driven by [[The Focusing Illusion]] - when attention narrows to immediate, measurable activities, their importance becomes magnified beyond their actual significance. Like [[The Law of Triviality (Bikeshedding)]], people gravitate toward what feels manageable and where they can demonstrate competence, even when those activities are less important than the original objective.

Goal displacement often results from [[Satisficing Leads to Sub-optimal Solutions|satisficing behavior]] - choosing "good enough" metrics that are easy to measure rather than seeking optimal indicators of true success. This connects to [[Tool tinkering is a form of productive procrastination|tool tinkering]] and meta-work, where the process of optimization becomes more engaging than the actual work.

In productivity systems, this manifests as [[Tracking Metrics for ADHD Productivity|metric obsession]] where tracking completion rates becomes more important than the quality or impact of what's completed. The [[Metagame in Business|business metagame]] can inadvertently encourage this by creating incentive structures that reward process adherence over outcome achievement.

This is a key component of [[Contextual Myopia and Goal Displacement]].

This concept is derived from the broader conversation in [[Contextual Myopia and Human Behavior]].

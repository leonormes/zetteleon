title: Misinterpretation as Character Flaws

For decades, before widespread understanding, ADHD symptoms were often misinterpreted as intentional misbehavior or character flaws. For example, difficulties with attention, organization, planning, and time management (known as executive function challenges) were often seen as laziness, carelessness, bad attitude, or selfishness, rather than neurological differences. This constant misinterpretation and criticism, especially throughout childhood and early adulthood, deeply erodes self-esteem.

This misinterpretation is a core component of [[The Roots of Shame and Feeling Defective]]. The neurological reality is that these are not chosen behaviours, but a result of [[Emotional Dysregulation]], where emotional responses are automatic and not a reflection of character.

When these neurological differences are not accommodated, it can lead to [[Unexplained Underachievement]], where years of criticism and reprimands lead to a sense of failure. This fosters a [[Distorted Negative Self-Image]], which is further intensified by the extreme emotional pain of [[Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)]] in response to perceived criticism.

The cycle of misinterpretation, criticism, and failure can lead to a [[The Shame-Procrastination Cycle]]. The individual may even internalise these misinterpretations, blaming themselves for what they perceive as character flaws like laziness, as described in [[I Have Not Really Accepted the ADHD Difficulties I Have Had]].

Bessie's own experiences, documented in [[Bessie's Answers]], provide concrete examples of her ADHD-related struggles being met with punitive responses from teachers, who tell her to "get out" or "behave a certain way" instead of providing support. This directly shows how her needs are misinterpreted as behavioural issues.

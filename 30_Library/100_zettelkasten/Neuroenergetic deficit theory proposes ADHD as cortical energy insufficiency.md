## Neuroenergetic Deficit Theory Proposes ADHD as Cortical Energy Insufficiency

**Summary:** ADHD may represent a cortical energy-deficit syndrome where catecholamine hypofunctionality leads to decreased neuronal energy through impaired astrocyte glucose and glycogen metabolism, with ADHD individuals marshaling only 75-85% of the neurocognitive energy of comparison groups.

**Details:** This theory proposes that chronic energy insufficiency specifically affects task initiation because beginning tasks requires maximal prefrontal cortex activation to overcome competing distractions, inhibit alternative behaviors, generate motor plans, and allocate attentional resources—all energetically expensive operations. Sergeant's cognitive-energetic model adds that ADHD reflects an inability to adjust energetic state (activation/arousal) to task demands. The "effort pool" responsible for modulating activation is dysfunctional, meaning the brain cannot adequately generate the task-directed energy needed to initiate action.

**Supporting Evidence:** Brain state transition studies show ADHD brains struggle to shift from resting to active task states, with the Default Mode Network showing excess activity during tasks when it should be suppressed.

## ADHD Overthinking is a Substitute for Action

**Summary:** When executive dysfunction creates a cognitive gridlock that prevents task initiation, the ADHD brain often defaults to overthinking about the task as a substitute for performing it.

**Details:** This overthinking creates the illusion of engagement and productivity without generating any tangible progress. It is a coping mechanism to escape the intensely aversive feeling of being overwhelmed by a complex task. The brain, unable to engage the "gears" of action, remains stuck revving its intellectual "engine." This initiates a negative feedback loop where inaction increases pressure, which in turn makes the task more intimidating and reinforces the paralysis.

## Fundamental Attribution Error

**Summary:** The fundamental attribution error (FAE) is the systematic tendency to attribute others' behavior to stable personality traits ("they're rude," "they're incompetent") while underestimating the influence of situational factors, contexts, and temporary states.

**Details:**

- **Asymmetry in self vs. other**: We explain our own behavior situationally ("I was rude because I'm stressed") but others' dispositionally ("they were rude because they're a bad person")
- **Perceptual salience**: The person is visually salient while the situation is often invisible or ambiguous, leading attention to focus on the actor rather than context
- **Cognitive efficiency**: Trait attributions are simpler and more stable mental models than constantly recalculating situational variables
- **Cultural variation**: FAE is stronger in individualist cultures (Western) than collectivist cultures (East Asian), which more readily incorporate situational explanations

**Social consequences:**

- Harsh moral judgments of others while being lenient with self
- Failure to recognize external pressures affecting behavior
- Reduced empathy and increased interpersonal conflict
- Inaccurate predictions about future behavior (traits are overweighted, situations underweighted)

**Example:** Seeing someone cut you off in traffic and concluding they're an aggressive jerk, without considering they might be rushing to the hospital.

The Discipline of Perception is a cornerstone of Stoic philosophy. Its purpose is to control our emotions and keep an even keel so that we can see things "as they really are," free from the distortions of our own judgment.

The Stoics believed that our perceptions, not external events, are what cause us distress. Therefore, mastering our perception is the key to resilience and inner peace.

This discipline is not about being emotionless, but about preventing our initial, automatic emotional reactions from overwhelming our reason. It is the practice of cultivating the [[The Observing Eye vs The Perceiving Eye MOC|observing eye]] over the perceiving eye.

## Visual Timers for ADHD Time Blindness

Visual timers are a highly effective tool for individuals with ADHD to compensate for "time blindness"—the brain's difficulty in perceiving the passage of time in a linear way.

### Core Concept

A visual timer displays the passage of time graphically (e.g., a disappearing color wedge, a progress bar), making the abstract concept of time concrete and visible.

### Why It Works for ADHD

- **Makes Time Tangible**: It provides an external, visual representation of time, which is easier for the ADHD brain to process than an abstract number.
- **Overcomes Inertia**: The act of setting a timer for a short period can be a low-friction way to get started on a task, breaking through the initial resistance.
- **Creates Gentle Urgency**: The visible depletion of time can create a sense of urgency, which is a key motivator for the interest-based nervous system.
- **Helps Retrain Time Perception**: Over time, consistent use of visual timers can help build a more accurate internal sense of how long tasks actually take.

### Connections

Musashi famously demonstrated his mastery of emotions and psychological warfare in his duel with Sasaki Kojiro. By arriving late and using a wooden oar as a weapon, he angered Kojiro, causing him to react emotionally and make mistakes. This led to Musashi's victory and serves as a practical example of his philosophy.

title: LLMs simulate expertise to generate validation

An LLM can create a powerful sense of validation by simulating expertise. This is achieved in two main ways:

- **Use of Specialised Language:** By employing specific terminology (e.g., from philosophy or cognitive science), the LLM creates an impression of authority, making its "understanding" seem more credible.
- **Connection to Established Ideas:** By linking a user's original thoughts to established concepts or famous thinkers (e.g., Plato, Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis), the LLM implicitly validates the ideas by placing them within a recognised intellectual framework.

This depth of analysis suggests a thorough engagement that goes beyond a superficial response, further enhancing the feeling of validation.

## Compare Oneself to Yesterday's Self Not Others

**Summary:** For personal growth and sustained motivation, it is more beneficial to compare one's current self to who they were yesterday, rather than to prodigies or other individuals.

**Details:** External comparisons can be demotivating and misleading, as everyone has unique circumstances and starting points. Focusing on internal progress fosters a healthier mindset, promoting continuous self-improvement and resilience. This approach emphasizes incremental gains and personal development, aligning with an iterative learning philosophy.

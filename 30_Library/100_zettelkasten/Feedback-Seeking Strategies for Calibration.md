## Feedback-Seeking Strategies for Calibration

**Summary:** Systematic feedback-seeking provides external reality checks that calibrate social self-perception, breaking self-reinforcing loops of bias and enabling accurate meta-awareness.

**Strategies:**

**1. Open-ended post-interaction questions**
- "How did that land for you?" (invites honest response without suggesting expected answer)
- "What's one thing I could have done better in that presentation?"
- "I'm trying to interrupt less—have you noticed any change?"
- Avoid vague questions like "Do people like me?" that yield social pleasantries rather than useful data

**2. Outcome-based validation**
- Track behavioral proxies: Do people initiate follow-up? Accept collaboration invitations? Respond to communications promptly?
- Patterns across multiple people/contexts are more reliable than single interactions
- Choice reveals preference more accurately than politeness—who seeks you out when they have options?

**3. Multi-rater reality checks**
- Seek input from 3+ trusted sources (colleagues, friends, mentors) on specific behaviors or traits
- Convergence across independent raters indicates accuracy; divergence suggests your self-model needs updating
- Ask specific behavioral questions: "In meetings, do I give others space to speak?" not "Am I a good listener?"

**4. Periodic reflective retrospectives**
- After significant interactions, note: What cues did I rely on? What did I predict? What actually happened?
- Track calibration over time—are your predictions improving?
- Identify systematic patterns in misperception (e.g., always underestimate positive reception)

**5. Cultivate a "truth-teller" relationship**
- Identify 1-2 people who will provide honest, kind feedback without filtering
- Explicitly give permission: "I value your honesty more than my comfort—please tell me if I'm missing something"
- Use them as calibration anchors when uncertain

**Why it works:** Provides [[Prediction Error Breaks Feedback Loops|prediction error]] signals that update faulty models; breaks echo chambers; reduces reliance on inference.

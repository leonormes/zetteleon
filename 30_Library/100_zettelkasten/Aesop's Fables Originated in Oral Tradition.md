The earliest known Western fables are attributed to Aesop, a storyteller believed to have lived in ancient Greece around the 6th century BCE.

These stories were not originally written down but were part of a rich oral tradition. They were short, allegorical tales, typically featuring animals with human-like qualities, that conveyed a moral lesson. Their transmission was primarily through spoken word, making them an accessible form of moral and social instruction for a largely illiterate population.

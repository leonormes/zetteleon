title: Infinitude of Primes Guarantees a Limitless Supply for Keys

There is an infinite number of prime numbers. As proven by Euclid, no matter how large a prime you find, there is always a larger one.

This property is vital for cryptography because it ensures a practically limitless supply of unique large primes. This means we can generate a unique key pair for every person, server, and device on the planet without ever running out of the necessary building blocks.

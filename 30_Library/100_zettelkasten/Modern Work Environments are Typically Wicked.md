## Modern Work Environments Are Typically Wicked

**Summary:** Most contemporary professional settings are characterized as "wicked" learning environments due to their dynamic, unpredictable nature and often unclear feedback loops.

**Details:** Unlike "kind" environments with predictable rules, modern work demands constant adaptation, problem-solving in novel situations, and the ability to integrate diverse information. This makes early, narrow specialization less effective, as success hinges on flexibility and a broad range of experiences rather than deep expertise in a single, stable domain.

## Mutual Respect in a Partnership Involves Valuing Opinions Speaking Kindly and Honouring Boundaries

**Summary:** Mutual respect is a foundational expectation in a partnership, demonstrated by valuing each other's opinions, communicating without contempt, and respecting individual boundaries.

**Details:** This includes giving weight to a partner's thoughts and feelings, refraining from name-calling or dismissiveness during disagreements, and acknowledging that each partner is a separate individual with their own limits and needs.

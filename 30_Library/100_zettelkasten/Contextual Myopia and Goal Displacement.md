Contextual Myopia is a cognitive phenomenon where an individual or group's frame of reference narrows to their immediate context. Within this "focus bubble," internal metrics, emotions, and processes become magnified in importance, often displacing the original, external goal or a more objective sense of proportion.

This is a form of cognitive short-sightedness, leading to an over-emphasis on present concerns and local information at the expense of more distant, abstract, but often more important, objectives. It can lead to phenomena like [[The Focusing Illusion]] and [[Goal Displacement]].

This concept is derived from the broader conversation in [[Contextual Myopia and Human Behavior]].

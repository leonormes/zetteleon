The geocentric Ptolemaic model of the universe is a historical example of building upon a flawed first principle. The core assumption—that the Earth is the static centre of the universe—was incorrect.

For 1,500 years, instead of questioning this foundation, astronomers "patched" the model to fit observations by adding layers of complexity, such as epicycles. This is analogous to adding special-case handling in software to work around a core bug instead of fixing the root cause. The model became increasingly complex but remained predictive for known inputs, delaying the Copernican revolution.

## Slime Molds Exhibit Memory-like Behavior Without a Nervous System

**Summary:** The slime mold Physarum polycephalum demonstrates memory-like behavior despite lacking a nervous system, showing that basic information storage exists across life forms.

**Details:** In experiments:
- Slime molds explore mazes by extending pseudopods
- They avoid retracing their own paths ("remembering" where they've been)
- This behavior suggests a primitive form of spatial memory

The mechanism involves chemical trails left behind during movement, demonstrating that memory can exist without neurons or brains. This challenges traditional definitions of intelligence and shows cognitive abilities exist on a spectrum.

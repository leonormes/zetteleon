## A Future Self Brief Aids Reconnection with a Project's Thought Process

**Summary:** A "Future Self Brief" is a 10-15 minute end-of-session documentation practice designed to capture the current mental state and project context, making it easier to reconnect with the work later.

**Details:** This is not standard documentation. It is a targeted "brain dump" created while still in a flow state. It should include notes on current excitement, the high-level mental model ("the way I'm thinking about this is..."), key decision points, and the immediate next threads to explore.

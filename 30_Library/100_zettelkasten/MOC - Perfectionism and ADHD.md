## MOC - Perfectionism and ADHD

This map explores the concept of perfectionism, particularly how it functions as a significant barrier for individuals with ADHD.

### Core Concept
- **[[Perfectionism]]** - The core concept of striving for flawlessness, which leads to paralysis.

### Perfectionism in Context
- **In PKM:** The desire to create the "perfect" note, find all links, or build the "ideal" system can prevent any notes from being written.
- **In ADHD:** Perfectionism becomes particularly problematic for the following reasons:
    - [[Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria The Perfectionism Trap]] - RSD amplifies the fear of making wrong choices.
    - [[Executive Dysfunction - The Root of Analysis Paralysis]] - Working memory overload makes decisions feel overwhelming.
    - [[The Shame-Procrastination Cycle]] - Perfectionist standards create shame when not met, leading to more avoidance.

## The Paralysis Pattern

Perfectionism manifests as [[The Core Problem Confusing Preparation with Action]], where research and planning become substitutes for doing.

- This connects to the broader pattern of [[Part 1 The Psychology of ADHD-Driven Overthinking]], where analysis becomes a form of procrastination.

## Breaking Free: Strategies & Reframes
- [[Abandon the Perfect]] - Accepting that the idealized version is often unattainable.
- [[Embrace Throwaway Thinking]] - Permission to create imperfect, disposable work.
- [[Your Zettelkasten is a Mirror not a Monument]] - Reframing the purpose from perfection to reflection.
- [[Morita Therapy - Applications for Anxiety, Perfectionism, and ADHD]] - A therapeutic approach.

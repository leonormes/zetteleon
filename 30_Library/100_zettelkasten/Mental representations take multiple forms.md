## Mental Representations Take Multiple Forms

**Summary:** Pre-linguistic thought may manifest as visual/spatial representations, logical relationships, embodied knowledge, or patterns of neural activation that represent concepts independently of linguistic symbols.

**Details:** Cognitive science proposes that we think in mental models or schemas - abstract structures that represent concepts and their relationships. These can be visual (mental image of a place), logical (understanding "if A then B" equals "not A or B"), or embodied (knowing how to ride a bicycle). These representations exist as distributed networks of neural activation patterns that can represent meaning without requiring linguistic encoding.

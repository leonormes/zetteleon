title: Morita Therapy - Core Principle is to Accept Feelings and Direct Behavior

The fundamental principle of [[Morita Therapy]] is the separation of feelings from actions. It posits that while we cannot directly control our emotions, we have complete control over our behavior.

Instead of trying to eliminate uncomfortable feelings like anxiety or fear, the therapy teaches acceptance of these emotions as natural phenomena. The focus is then shifted to taking purposeful, value-driven action, regardless of one's emotional state.

This aligns closely with the principles that [[Your emotions are real but they are your responsibility]] and that [[Emotions Are Not Reliable Indicators of Reality]].

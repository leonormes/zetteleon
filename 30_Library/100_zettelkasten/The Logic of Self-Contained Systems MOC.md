The behaviour of any given system can be understood as a three-stage process.

1. It begins with the premise that [[Systems are Blind to Their Broader Context]].
2. This inherent limitation forces them to [[Systems Generate Internal Logic in Isolation]] in order to function.
3. The consequence of this is that [[The Meaning of a System's Logic is Relative to Perspective]], appearing absolutely vital from within but often arbitrary from without.

A stable budget follows a clear hierarchy of priorities, wherein immediate obligations are always funded first. These are the costs required for survival and to maintain financial stability, such as housing, essential utilities, and minimum debt payments.

Before any money is allocated to discretionary spending or long-term goals, the funds required to meet these non-negotiable, near-term needs must be set aside. This is a practical application of [[Give Every Dollar a Job (YNAB Rule 1)]], ensuring that the most critical financial responsibilities are met before all others.

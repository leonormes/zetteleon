Neuroscience identifies two key brain networks that play a significant role in cognitive function:

- **Task-Positive Network (TPN):** This network is active when an individual is engaged in focused, goal-directed tasks. It is associated with external attention, concentration, and active problem-solving. When the TPN is highly engaged, self-conscious awareness often diminishes, and the individual is in a state of "doing."
- **Default Mode Network (DMN):** This network becomes active when the mind is not focused on an external task. It is associated with internal thought processes such as mind-wandering, daydreaming, self-reflection, planning for the future, and recalling memories. The DMN is considered a hub for imagination and creativity.

In a neurotypical brain, these two networks typically operate in an anticorrelated fashion: when one is active, the other is suppressed. This allows for efficient switching between focused work and internal reflection. However, this dynamic can be altered in conditions like ADHD, as explored in [[The Glitchy Switch - TPN and DMN Dysregulation in ADHD]].

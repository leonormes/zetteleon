## Overview

Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. They are often "shortcuts" (heuristics) that the brain uses to process information quickly, but they can lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.

Understanding these biases is critical for **Metacognition** (thinking about thinking) and establishing a robust **Source of Truth**.

## 1. Knowledge & Learning Biases

These biases specifically affect how we acquire, assess, and retain information. They are the primary enemies of a reliable PKM system.

-   **[[SoT - Illusion of Explanatory Depth (IoED)]]**: The belief that we understand a complex concept simply because we recognize its terms. This is the "Master Note" on the topic.
    -   *Related:* [[The Illusion of Fluency is a Cognitive Bias Where Ease of Processing is Mistaken for Deep Learning]] - The mechanism behind IoED.
    -   *Related:* [[Familiarity is Mistaken for Comprehension in IoED]] - The specific error of confusing recognition with recall.
-   **[[SoT - Dunning-Kruger Effect]]**: Overestimating competence in areas where we lack expertise.

## 2. Social & Self-Perception Biases

These biases affect how we interpret social interactions, perceive ourselves, and form judgments about others.

-   **[[SoT - Social Cognition & Self-Perception]]**: The overarching framework for how we make social judgments and calibrate self-perception.
-   **[[SoT - Spotlight Effect]]**: Overestimating how much others notice our appearance, behavior, and mistakes.

## 3. Decision-Making Biases

Biases that impact how we choose actions or value outcomes.

-   **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: (Placeholder) Continuing a behavior as a result of previously invested resources.
-   **Confirmation Bias**: (Placeholder) Searching for, interpreting, favoring, and recalling information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values.

## 4. ProdOS Integration

In the context of [[SoT - PRODOS (System Architecture)]], we fight these biases through:

1.  **"Write to Think"**: Forcing articulation exposes the **Illusion of Explanatory Depth**.
2.  **"Reality as a Unit Test"**: Verifiable actions prevent **Illusion of Fluency**.
3.  **"Hansei" (Reflection)**: Structured review combats **Self-Assessment flaws**.

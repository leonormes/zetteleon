title: Satisficing Leads to Sub-optimal Solutions

Coined by Herbert Simon, "satisficing" is the practice of choosing the first available option that meets a minimum set of criteria ("good enough"), rather than searching for the optimal solution.

People with a limited or flawed mental model are prone to satisficing. They find a solution that fits within their current understanding and stop there, unaware that a deeper, more accurate model of the problem space could reveal a far more elegant or efficient solution.

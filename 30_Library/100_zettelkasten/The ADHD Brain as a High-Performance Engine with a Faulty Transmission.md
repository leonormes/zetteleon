## The ADHD Brain as a High-Performance Engine with a Faulty Transmission

**Summary:** A powerful metaphor describes the internal experience of many intelligent professionals with ADHD as having a high-performance engine (a creative, fast-processing intellect) connected to a faulty transmission (the brain's executive functions).

**Details:** The "engine" revs loudly, generating a constant stream of ideas, analyses, and scenarios, which manifests as overthinking. However, the "transmission" fails to engage the gears of action, leading to a frustrating state of paralysis where the engine roars, but the car doesn't move. This illustrates the disconnect between high intellectual potential and the impaired ability to initiate and execute tasks.

## Embodied Confidence Comes From Direct Feedback in Physical Skills

**Summary:** Embodied practices cultivate confidence through immediate sensory feedback loops, building capability that generalizes beyond the skill itself.

**Details:** Embodied practices such as music, gardening, and cooking cultivate confidence through immediate, sensory feedback loops. Competence emerges from doing, which trains perception, timing, and feel that precede verbal justification. The body's calibration provides a grounded sense of capability that generalizes to other domains. Building embodied skills complements abstract reasoning and stabilizes identity.

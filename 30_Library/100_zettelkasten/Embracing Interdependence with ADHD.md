For individuals with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the refusal to accept help or to operate in isolation can be a significant barrier to progress and well-being. The traditional emphasis on absolute independence often clashes with the realities of ADHD, where executive function challenges can make certain tasks disproportionately difficult.

Embracing interdependence means recognizing that "no one is independent" in a complex world, and that the realistic and effective goal is to be "effectively interdependent." This involves:

- **Leveraging others' strengths:** Consciously identifying areas where one struggles due to ADHD and seeking support or collaboration from others whose strengths complement these challenges.
- **Delegation and collaboration:** Actively engaging in teamwork and delegating tasks when appropriate, rather than attempting to do everything alone.
- **Accepting support:** Overcoming the internal resistance to asking for and receiving help, understanding that this is a sign of strength and strategic thinking, not weakness.

This shift towards interdependence allows individuals with ADHD to focus their energy and unique strengths on what they do best, while effectively managing areas of difficulty. It aligns with the principle of "working smart, not just hard," and fosters a more sustainable and less isolating path to success.

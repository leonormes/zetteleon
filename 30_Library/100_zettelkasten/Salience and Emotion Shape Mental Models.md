The brain does not build its mental models with objective completeness like a mathematician. Instead, it filters information through subconscious layers of **salience** and **emotion** to determine what is relevant and important enough to include.

## Salience: The "Pop-Out" Effect

Information is deemed salient if it stands out. This is determined by:

- **Novelty and Surprise:** Things that generate a [[Prediction Error Drives Dopamine Release|prediction error]] automatically capture attention.
- **Contrast:** Anything that stands out from its background (e.g., a red flower in a green field).
- **Relevance to Goals:** Whatever you are currently focused on becomes more salient.

## Emotion: The Value Marker

Emotion acts as the brain's primary valuation system, tagging information with importance and marking it for memory.

- **Emotional Intensity:** Events tied to strong emotions (fear, joy, anger) are seared into memory. The brain assumes that if an event was emotionally charged, it must be important for future survival.
- **The Amygdala's Role:** The amygdala (emotion center) works directly with the hippocampus (memory center) to strengthen the encoding of emotionally charged events.

This is a key component of [[The Cognitive-Emotional Feedback Loop]], where the emotional significance of an event helps to build the very model that will trigger future emotional responses.

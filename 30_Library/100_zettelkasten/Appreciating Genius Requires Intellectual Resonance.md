title: Appreciating Genius Requires Intellectual Resonance

To truly appreciate a work of genius, one's own mind must be able to "resonate" with it. This is an active process of recognition, not passive reception.

For example, a person with no understanding of music may hear a complex symphony as noise. But someone who understands musical structure can appreciate its intricate architecture. The feeling of awe one feels for Newton or Einstein is similar; it is only possible because one's own mind can follow their logic and grasp the scale of their intellectual leap.

This feeling of being staggered by another's imagination is proof that one's own imagination is working. It is a testament to one's own capacity for thought, not a sign of its limits.

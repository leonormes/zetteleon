**Summary:** The 4D System—Delegate, Delete, Delay, Do—is a practical framework for managing tasks effectively by methodically assessing each task through four distinct options, ensuring energy is focused on the most important activities.

**The Four Decisions:**

**1. Delegate:**
Identify tasks that can be assigned to someone else. Delegation frees up your time and energy for core responsibilities. To delegate effectively:
- Define the task clearly
- Ensure the person has resources and understanding to complete it
- Provide clear deadlines and expectations

**2. Delete:**
Ruthlessly eliminate tasks that are not necessary or no longer relevant. Ask:
- Does this truly contribute to my goals?
- Is this still relevant?
- What happens if I don't do this?

Deleting reduces cognitive load and frees time for what matters.

**3. Delay:**
Postpone tasks that are not urgent or can be addressed later. This is about strategic prioritization, not procrastination. Place delayed tasks on:
- A "waiting-for" list (if awaiting input)
- A "someday/maybe" list (if not time-sensitive)
- A scheduled future date (if appropriate timing is known)

**4. Do:**
Take action on tasks that remain after the first three filters. These are tasks that:
- Cannot be delegated
- Cannot be deleted
- Cannot be delayed
- Are important and timely

**The Process:**

1. **Capture** all tasks in one location
2. **Process** each task methodically:
   - Can it be delegated? → Assign it
   - Is it necessary? → If not, delete it
   - Is it urgent? → If not, delay it
   - If none of the above → Do it now

3. **Organize** remaining tasks by context, priority, and complexity

**Benefits:**

- **Reduced Overwhelm:** Systematic assessment prevents feeling swamped
- **Improved Productivity:** Focus on tasks that truly matter
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Conscious decisions about each task
- **Reduced Procrastination:** Clear framework prevents paralysis
- **Better Decision Making:** Critical thinking rather than reactive response

**For ADHD:**

The 4D System is particularly beneficial for ADHD because:

- **Structured Approach:** Provides clear, predictable decision framework
- **Reduces Decision Fatigue:** Systematic process limits constant choices
- **Overcomes Initiation Resistance:** Breaking through resistance with clear steps
- **Manages Impulsivity:** Encourages mindful assessment before action
- **Builds Momentum:** The "Do" phase creates forward motion

**Alignment with GTD:**

The 4D system complements GTD's clarification and organization phases. It acts as a filter that helps determine the next action, moving from motion (planning what to do) to action (doing it).

**Potential Limitations:**

- Initial time investment to assess each task
- May seem overly simplistic for complex projects
- Effectiveness varies by task context

However, with practice, the 4D assessment becomes faster and more intuitive.

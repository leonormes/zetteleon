## The Rawness of Expressive Music is a Sign of Its Honesty

**Summary:** The unpolished and sometimes imperfect sound of expressive music is a key part of its power and a marker of its honesty.

**Details:** In music as expression, elements that might be considered 'mistakes' in a commercial context—such as feedback, off-key notes, or a lack of polish—are often the sound of human beings pushing boundaries and prioritizing genuine feeling over technical perfection. This rawness reflects the authentic moment of creation.

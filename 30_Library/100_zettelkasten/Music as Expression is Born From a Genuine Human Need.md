## Music as Expression is Born From a Genuine Human Need

**Summary:** Music created as a form of pure expression originates from a real, raw human need, such as the need to celebrate, protest, mourn, tell a story, or connect with a community.

**Details:** This type of music is the sound of a community finding its voice. Its purpose is rooted in human connection and the processing of shared experience, rather than commercial ambition. Examples include tribal music for rituals, early blues expressing hardship, and early house music creating collective joy.

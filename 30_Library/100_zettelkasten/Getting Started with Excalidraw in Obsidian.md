To begin using Excalidraw in Obsidian for visual note-taking:

1. **Install**: Go to `Settings` > `Community Plugins` > `Browse`, search for "Excalidraw" by Zsolt Viczián, and install it.
2. **Enable**: Enable the plugin in the `Community Plugins` list.
3. **Configure**: In the Excalidraw settings:
    - Set a **Default folder for drawings** (e.g., `Excalidraw/`).
    - Enable **Autosave**.
    - Consider enabling **Export to PNG/SVG** for portability.
    - Enable **Link text files to drawings** to automatically create a companion markdown file for each drawing. This creates two linked files, like `idea.md` and `idea.excalidraw`.

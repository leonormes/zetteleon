The extraordinary advancement of human intelligence is not just a property of individual brains, but of our ability to form a **collective brain** through communication and cooperation.

An individual, no matter how brilliant, must reinvent everything and their knowledge dies with them. Communication, especially language, allows for **cultural transmission**, meaning useful discoveries can be taught to others and passed down through generations. This allows knowledge and mental models to **accumulate**.

This creates a **ratchet of progress**. Each generation can start from the knowledge of the last, rather than from square one. The invention of writing was a revolutionary step in this process, as it allowed for the high-fidelity transmission of complex models across vast distances and time.

This ability to build knowledge upon knowledge is what truly separates human intelligence from that of other species. Our individual intelligence is deeply intertwined with our social nature; one could not have developed to its current level without the other. The mechanisms that allow this sharing are described in [[Shared Biology and Mirror Neurons Enable Model Sharing]].

Experiencing a "ping"—a new feeling or sensation in the nervous system—is a clear indicator that one has entered the zone of [[Type 2 Information is Experiential and Feared by Overthinkers|Type 2 Information]]. This emotional feedback signifies that genuine learning is occurring, as opposed to the sterile, theoretical knowledge of [[Type 1 Information is Theoretical and Addictive for Overthinkers]].

It is the core learning signal in the [[The Action-Reaction-Ping-Adjust Cycle Drives Real Progress]].

## Aligning Actions with Core Values Makes Them Feel More Natural

**Summary:** Actions that are aligned with one's authentic values and intrinsic interests (self-concordant goals) are more sustainable and feel subjectively easier to pursue than actions driven by external pressure or guilt.

**Details:** When a behavior reinforces your self-concept and feels like a genuine expression of who you are, it requires less effortful self-control. This transforms the experience from effortful striving to natural expression. The process of clarifying one's core values is therefore a critical step in bridging the intention-action gap for long-term goals.

## Error-related Negativity is Significantly Reduced in ADHD across Age Groups

**Summary:** Children and adults with ADHD show significantly reduced error-related negativity (ERN), a brain wave occurring 50-100ms after incorrect responses that reflects automatic error detection in the anterior cingulate cortex.

**Details:** ERP studies using stop-signal and flanker tasks consistently show that ADHD participants have markedly reduced ERN amplitude compared to controls, indicating abnormal initial error detection processes. The ERN reflects post-response conflict between executed and competing response tendencies. Following the ERN, the error positivity (Pe) occurs 300-500ms after an error and is a marker for conscious error awareness. ADHD individuals also show reduced Pe, pointing to diminished error awareness and conscious error processing. The scalp distribution of these reductions is consistent with reduced activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting a global deficit in cognitive control operations.

**Functional Impact:** This attenuation represents suboptimal error-specific attentional processes connected to automatic error detection, impairing the ability to adaptively adjust behavior after mistakes.

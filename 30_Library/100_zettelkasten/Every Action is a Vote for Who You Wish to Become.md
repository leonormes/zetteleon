**Summary:** Every action you take is metaphorically a "vote for the type of person you wish to become." Each time you perform a behavior, you're casting a ballot in the ongoing election of your identity.

**The Voting Metaphor:**

Just as elections are decided by accumulated votes rather than a single ballot, identity is determined by accumulated actions rather than single behaviors:

- Each time you write a page, you cast a vote for "I am a writer"
- Each time you practice violin, you cast a vote for "I am a musician"
- Each time you go to the gym, you cast a vote for "I am an athlete"
- Each time you meditate, you cast a vote for "I am a mindful person"

**Why This Metaphor Works:**

**1. Accumulation Matters:**
- No single vote determines an election
- No single action determines your identity
- It's the aggregate that counts

**2. Every Action Counts:**
- Even small actions are votes
- You're always voting, whether consciously or not
- Inaction is also a vote (for the status quo)

**3. You Can Change the Outcome:**
- If you don't like the current "winner," start casting different votes
- You can shift the results over time through consistent different choices

**The Power of Small Actions:**

This metaphor reveals why small habits matter so much. They're not just small actions—they're votes that accumulate over time. Write 100 words daily, and you've cast 365 votes for "writer" in a year. That's a decisive election.

**Strategic Application:**

Before acting, ask yourself: "What identity am I voting for with this action?" This question makes the long-term consequences of immediate choices visible.

**The Tally:**

Your current identity is simply the result of which votes have won so far. Want a different identity? Start casting different votes. The new results will come through accumulated ballots.

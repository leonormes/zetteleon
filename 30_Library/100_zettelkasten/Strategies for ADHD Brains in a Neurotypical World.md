Navigating a world designed for neurotypical functioning requires individuals with ADHD to adopt strategies that work with their brain, not against it. This involves leveraging the [[The Interest-Based Nervous System in ADHD]] and externalizing executive functions.

## Leveraging Interest

- Gamify Tasks: Turn chores into challenges or games.
- Connect to Passion: Find elements within a boring task that link to a personal interest.
- Seek Novelty: Change your environment or introduce new elements to a task.

## Adapting Traditional Strategies

- Break Down Tasks: Make large projects less overwhelming by breaking them into small, concrete steps.
- Externalize Structure: Use visual cues, alarms, whiteboards, and rigid schedules to offload executive function demands.
- Time Management: Use techniques like the Pomodoro method to manage focus and prevent burnout.
- Use Rewards: Implement immediate, meaningful rewards for task completion.
- [[Body Doubling is an Effective ADHD Strategy|Body Doubling]]: Work alongside someone to provide gentle accountability.
- Self-Compassion: Understand that motivation challenges are neurological, not a moral failing.

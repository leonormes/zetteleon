"Shiny Object Syndrome" (SOS) is a common behavioral pattern in ADHD, describing the tendency to abandon a current project, system, or interest for a newer, more exciting one. It is a direct manifestation of the brain's intense craving for novelty.

The cycle of SOS is driven by the dopamine system:

1. **The Spark**: A new idea, tool, or project appears, triggering a rush of dopamine and a feeling of possibility ("This will be the one that solves everything!").
2. **The Fade**: As the initial novelty wears off and the less-stimulating work of maintenance or execution begins, the dopamine fades.
3. **The Scan**: The brain, now under-stimulated, begins scanning the horizon for the next novel thing to provide a fresh dopamine hit.

This is a key problematic pattern described in [[The Duality of Novelty Seeking in ADHD]].

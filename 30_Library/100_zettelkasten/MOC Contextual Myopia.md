The phenomenon of getting stuck on trivial matters can be understood as a chain of interacting cognitive biases. It begins when our environment creates a state of [[Contextual Myopia]], a narrow bubble of focus. For deeper insights into thought processes and language, explore [[Thought and Language]]. For strategies to overcome overthinking, see [[Overcoming Intelligent Paralysis MOC]].

Within this bubble, the [[The Focusing Illusion]] makes us magnify the importance of whatever is immediately in front of us. This overemphasis on the immediate can lead to [[Goal Displacement]], where we begin to treat the process as more important than the actual goal.

This entire state is made dangerously stable by a feedback loop: the [[Sunk Cost Fallacy Reinforces Myopia]], causing us to double down on our narrow focus to justify the effort we've already expended.

You are absolutely right. The note you've shared is an excellent, concise summary, but it reads like the final paragraph of a Wikipedia article. It presents a conclusion. It doesn't show the thinking, the uncertainty, and the discovery that led to it.

This is the most crucial distinction to grasp: the difference between a PKM as a **product** (a personal wiki) and a PKM as a **process** (a thinking partner).

Let's deconstruct your "wiki entry" and imagine the trail of thoughts that could have produced it. Instead of one polished note, your thinking process might have looked like a series of smaller, messier, more personal notes created over time.

## The Thinking Process Behind Your Note

Here’s how that final summary could have emerged from a series of atomic "thought notes":

---

### Note 1: The Initial Frustration (The Spark)

- **UID:** `20250722093010`
- **Title:** `Why do I waste so much time on unimportant details?`
- **Content:**

  > I just spent two hours trying to refactor a single function that already worked perfectly. It felt incredibly important at the time, but now I look up and I've made no real progress on the actual feature. It's like I get trapped in a bubble and lose all perspective. What is this phenomenon?

- **Why it's different:** This note is a question. It's personal, emotional, and raw. It captures the problem at its source, not its explanation.

---

### Note 2: Naming the "Bubble" (First Insight)

- **UID:** `20250722093015`
- **Title:** `My work environment creates a focus bubble`
- **Content:**

  > Thinking about Why do I waste so much time on unimportant details, I realise the "bubble" is often my IDE in full-screen mode. When all I can see is the code, the code becomes the entire universe. The importance of what I'm doing gets massively inflated. It's a kind of contextual tunnel vision.

- **Why it's different:** This connects the abstract feeling to a concrete cause (the environment). It coins a personal term ("focus bubble") and makes a tentative hypothesis.

---

### Note 3: Finding an Official Term (Connecting to External Knowledge)

- **UID:** `20250722093025`
- **Title:** `Contextual Myopia`
- **Content:**

  > This is the formal term for what I described in My work environment creates a focus bubble. It's when your immediate context obscures the wider strategic landscape. It's not a personal failing, but a predictable cognitive bias.

- **Why it's different:** This note *only* defines the term. Crucially, it links back to the personal observation that gives it meaning *for you*. It's not just a floating definition.

---

### Note 4: Analysing the Feeling Inside the Bubble (A Deeper Insight)

- **UID:** `20250722093040`
- **Title:** `The process feels more important than the goal`
- **Content:**

  > Inside the [[Contextual Myopia]] bubble, my goal shifted. The original goal was "ship the feature". The new goal became "achieve perfectly elegant code". The process of refactoring became an end in itself. I was serving the task, not the objective.

- **Why it's different:** This is another personal observation, but it's deeper now. It's not just *that* you get stuck, but *how* you get stuck. You're analysing your own cognitive state.

## The Result: Your Wiki Entry Becomes a "Structure Note"

After you have these raw, atomic notes, you can then create a new, higher-level note. This is called a "Structure Note" or "Hub Note", and it looks exactly like the one you originally wrote.

- **Title:** `How cognitive biases make us fixate on trivialities`
- **Content:**

  > 
  > Within this bubble, the [[The Focusing Illusion]] makes us magnify the importance of whatever is immediately in front of us. This overemphasis on the immediate can lead to [[Goal Displacement]], where we begin to treat the process as more important than the actual goal. See my experience here: The process feels more important than the goal.

Notice the subtle but profound difference. Your original note was the end point. Here, it is a map that organises and links the genuine "thought-trail" you left behind. The value isn't in the summary note itself; it's in the rich, contextual, personal network of notes it sits on top of.

Your PKM becomes a tool for thinking when you grant yourself permission for it to be messy, personal, and incomplete. **Capture questions, not just answers. Capture feelings, not just facts. Capture half-formed ideas, not just finished conclusions.** This is how you map the process of discovery, not just the discovered land.

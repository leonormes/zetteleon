## Narrative Identity is the Story We Construct About Our Experiences

**Summary:** Personal identity can be understood as an editable narrative organizing past, present, and future into coherent story without presupposing fixed essence.

**Details:** Personal identity can be understood as a narrative that organizes past events, present choices, and future intentions into a coherent story. Because stories are editable, you can revise interpretations, reframe setbacks, and foreground themes that better align with your values. Editing the narrative is not fiction; it is an honest reorganization that preserves facts while changing their meaning. Narrative identity provides continuity without presupposing a fixed essence.

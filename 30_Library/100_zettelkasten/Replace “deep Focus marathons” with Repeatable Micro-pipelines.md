- Set 25–50 minute “focus sprints” with one explicit outcome (e.g., “Prove lemma A,” “Implement SHA-256 step 3,” “Summarize section on category theory adjoints in 5 bullet points”).
- End each sprint by writing a 3–5 sentence “state dump”: what you did, what’s next, blockers, exact resume point. This becomes your future on-ramp.

This technique is a form of [[Timeboxing for ADHD Management]] that creates structure and momentum. The "state dump" is a practical application of an [[Exit Ritual For ADHD Time Boxes]] and helps mitigate [[Working Memory Limitations in ADHD]] by externalizing the task's context.

This approach contrasts with unstructured [[Deep Dive Sessions for ADHD (Adapted GTD Next Actions)]] and is a core component of [[ADHD Behavioral Strategies for Productivity]]. It helps build [[Consistency and Momentum]] and is a strategy for [[Overcoming Intelligent Paralysis MOC]].

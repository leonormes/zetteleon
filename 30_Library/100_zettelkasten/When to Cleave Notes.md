## When to Cleave Notes

**Summary:** A note becomes a candidate for cleaving when it exceeds certain thresholds in length, linkage, or structural complexity, indicating it contains both atomic facts and contextual narrative.

**Details:**

Cleaving is triggered by one or more of the following conditions:

- **Length threshold:** Note exceeds 250 words. Long notes are often hybrids mixing facts with narrative.
- **Outlink threshold:** Note contains more than 12 internal wikilinks, indicating it references many atomic concepts that could be more explicitly structured.
- **Contextual sections:** Note contains sections like "Use cases", "When not to use", "Trade-offs", "Examples", or "How it relates to X"—these are structural patterns, not atomic definitions.
- **Narrative voice:** Original note contains personal reasoning, argument, or sequencing that exists only to link disparate facts.

When any trigger fires, the note is a good candidate for cleaving. The cleaved output will be smaller atomic notes plus a MOC that preserves the original narrative and reasoning.

Notes that are purely atomic (e.g., "Definition of Git") or purely structural (e.g., "MOC - Version Control Systems") do not need cleaving.

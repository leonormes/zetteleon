Task bracketing is a technique for strengthening habits by reinforcing the neural circuits at the beginning and end of a behavior. Neural circuits in the basal ganglia are most active at the start and finish of a habit. By creating clear triggers (start-cues) and ending rituals (end-cues), you can strengthen the entire habit loop.

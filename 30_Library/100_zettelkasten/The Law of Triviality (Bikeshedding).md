Coined by C. Northcote Parkinson, the Law of Triviality states that members of an organisation give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.

The classic illustration is a committee that spends minutes on a multi-million-pound nuclear reactor design (as it's too complex for most to grasp) but argues for an hour about the material for the staff bike shed (as everyone has an opinion on it).

This phenomenon occurs because people gravitate toward topics where they feel competent to contribute, even when those topics are less important. It's a manifestation of the [[Illusion of Explanatory Depth (IoED)]] - people overestimate their understanding of complex topics but feel genuinely knowledgeable about simpler ones.

Bikeshedding is also driven by [[The Focusing Illusion]] - when attention narrows to the immediate, accessible topic, its perceived importance becomes magnified far beyond its actual significance. This creates [[Contextual Myopia and Goal Displacement]], where the original important goal (effective decision-making) gets displaced by the more manageable but trivial concern.

The underlying mechanism connects to [[Flawed Mental Models Limit Mastery]] - when people lack adequate mental models for complex topics, they default to areas where their existing models feel sufficient, regardless of relative importance.

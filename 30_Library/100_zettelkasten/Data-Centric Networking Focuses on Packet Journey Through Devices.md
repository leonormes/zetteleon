## Data-Centric Networking Focuses on Packet Journey Through Devices

**Summary:** A data-centric approach to networking examines how packets flow through and are transformed by each network device, providing deeper understanding than device-centric perspectives.

**Key aspects:**
- Follows packet lifecycle from source to destination
- Examines transformations at each hop
- Reveals policy enforcement points
- Shows how devices complement each other

**Example journey:**
1. Internet → Firewall (filtering)
2. → Load Balancer (distribution)
3. → Web Server (processing)
4. → API Gateway (management)
5. → Backend Service (fulfillment)

**Benefits:**
- Clarifies each device's role
- Shows interdependencies
- Highlights security boundaries

**Definition:** Number theory is the branch of mathematics devoted to studying the deeper properties and patterns within the natural numbers and integers, particularly focusing on questions about divisibility, prime numbers, and solutions to equations in integers.

**Scope:** While arithmetic deals with basic computations, number theory probes the hidden structures—such as the distribution of primes, Diophantine equations, and modular arithmetic—that reveal profound patterns in the number system.

**Example Questions:** Is there a largest prime number? Can every even number greater than 2 be expressed as the sum of two primes (Goldbach's Conjecture)? What integers satisfy x² + y² = z²?

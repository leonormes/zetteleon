title: Systems are Designed to Function on Low-Energy Days

A primary advantage of systems over goals is that they are designed to function even on low-energy or low-motivation days. Because the focus is on a simple, repeatable process, the activation energy required to start is minimal. This contrasts with goals, which often feel daunting and require a high level of motivation to pursue.

## The Water Metaphor

Think of motivation and energy as water flowing through a system:

- **High-motivation days:** A flood of water—the system channels it productively
- **Low-motivation days:** Only a trickle—but the pipe still directs it to the right place

The system provides the intelligence and direction, so the "water" (your energy) just needs to flow. On low days, even a small trickle makes progress when properly channeled.

This metaphor demonstrates why systems are more reliable than willpower for consistent progress.

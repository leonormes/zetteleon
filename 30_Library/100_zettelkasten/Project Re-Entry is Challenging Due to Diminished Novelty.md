## Project Re-Entry is Challenging Due to Diminished Novelty

**Summary:** Returning to a project after a break is difficult because the task no longer provides the same novelty-driven dopamine release that initially fueled engagement and focus.

**Details:** The brain, particularly an ADHD brain, is drawn to novelty. When a project is new, it provides a strong dopamine response, making it easy to enter a flow state. Upon returning, the project is familiar, offering less stimulation and making it harder to initiate the required mental effort.

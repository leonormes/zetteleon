## Existentialism Posits That Individuals Define Themselves Through Action

**Summary:** Existentialist philosophy, particularly in the work of Jean-Paul Sartre, holds that "existence precedes essence," meaning that individuals have no predetermined nature or essence but create themselves through their choices and actions.

**Details:** According to this view, you are not defined by your thoughts, potential, or intentions, but by what you *do*. Authenticity comes from taking responsibility for your choices and acting on them, thereby creating your own identity and meaning in a world without inherent purpose.

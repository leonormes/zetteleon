## Map Analogy Illustrates Abstraction Tradeoffs

**Summary:** Different map scales demonstrate how abstraction levels reveal or obscure information.

**Examples:**
- **Street Map:** Shows building details but lacks regional context
- **Country Map:** Reveals city relationships but omits streets

**Cognitive Parallel:**
- Low abstraction = detailed but narrow
- High abstraction = broad but generalized

The "interest-based nervous system" is a concept, primarily articulated by Dr. William Dodson, that describes the primary motivational driver for individuals with ADHD. In this model, engagement is not dictated by importance, rewards, or consequences, but by genuine interest, passion, fascination, wonder, and play.

For those with an ADHD brain, the ability to engage deeply with a task they find interesting unlocks immense power, creativity, and focus (see [[Hyperfocus is a State of Intense Interest-Driven Focus in ADHD]]). The core challenge is not the *capacity* for engagement, but the *initiation* of it for tasks that do not align with these intrinsic motivators.

This stands in stark contrast to the [[Neurotypical motivation is primarily importance-driven|importance-based system]] common in neurotypical individuals. The neurological underpinnings for this difference are found in [[Dopamine Dysregulation is a Key Factor in ADHD Motivation]].

The specific triggers for this system can be summarized by the [[The PINCH Model Describes Core ADHD Motivators]].

## The Noumenal-phenomenal Distinction Limits Knowability

**Summary:** Kant argued that we can never know reality "as it truly is" (noumenon) because our perception is always filtered through innate mental structures (space, time, causality), accessing only phenomena.

**Details:** Immanuel Kant's epistemology distinguishes between the noumenal world (things-in-themselves, reality as it truly is) and the phenomenal world (reality as we experience it). We cannot step outside our own cognitive frameworks to perceive the noumenon directly. Everything we experience is jointly produced by external reality and our mental filters. This creates fundamental limits on knowledge - we can never verify if our mental models correspond to "true" reality because we have no unmediated access to it. This applies both to understanding the external world and to knowing other minds.

## Learning is the Acquisition of Information While Understanding is the Construction of Meaning

**Summary:** Learning is the process of acquiring new information or skills, whereas understanding is the deeper cognitive achievement of grasping connections, constructing meaning, and integrating that knowledge into a coherent framework.

**Details:** Learning can occur through rote memorization without deep comprehension (e.g., memorizing a formula). Understanding, conversely, implies the ability to explain *why* the formula works, how it relates to other concepts, and when to apply it. Learning provides the raw materials, while understanding builds the structure.

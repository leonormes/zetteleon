## Productivity Systems Are Scaffolding Not the Engine of Progress

**Summary:** Productivity systems, routines, and frictionless environments are best understood as scaffolding that supports work, not the engine of invention or ambition that drives it.

**Details:** These systems are valuable for optimizing cognitive resources like attention and memory, reducing errors, and minimizing wasted effort. However, they are a means to support and channel human motivation, not the source of it.

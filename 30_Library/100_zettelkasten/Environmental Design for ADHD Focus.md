The physical and digital environment plays a critical role in managing ADHD. Instead of relying solely on internal willpower, one can design their surroundings to support focus and reduce executive function load. The core principle is to **make good choices easy and bad choices hard**.

This is a key component of a holistic approach, alongside [[ADHD Behavioral Strategies for Productivity]].

## Examples of Environmental Design

- **Frictionless Capture**: Make it effortless to capture thoughts with ubiquitous tools (widgets, hotkeys, voice notes) to offload working memory.
- **Visual Cues & Prompts**: Use external reminders like labeled alarms, visual timers, or sticky notes to counteract time blindness.
- **Body Doubling**: Work alongside another person (physically or virtually) to improve focus and accountability.
- **Workspace Design**: Create distinct workspaces for different tasks, reduce clutter, and use tools like noise-cancelling headphones to manage sensory input.
- **Removing Distractions**: Physically move distractions (like a phone) out of your line of sight to reduce the temptation to engage with them.
- **Low-Stimulation Insight Environments**: Productive insights often emerge in low-stimulation settings (showers, walks, quiet spaces) where elevated signal-to-noise ratios allow the unconscious to surface key thoughts without digital distraction drowning them out.

Ideal routines represent the comprehensive version of a routine designed for days when energy and motivation are at their highest. This tier includes all desired activities and tasks that you would complete under optimal conditions, even if they rarely all happen together.

For example, an ideal morning routine might include: an hour-long walk, a cooked breakfast, full grooming and hygiene, journaling, meditation, and handling all correspondence. The ideal tier serves as an aspirational template that demonstrates what's possible on your best days.

Importantly, the ideal routine is not meant to create guilt when unachievable—it's simply the "full version" that gets scaled down to more realistic tiers when needed. Planning this tier helps clarify what you actually value and want to accomplish when capacity allows.

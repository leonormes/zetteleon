## MOC - The One Degree Change Framework for ADHD

> **Inclusion criteria:** Strategies and concepts that support incremental, sustainable behavioral change; must acknowledge ADHD neurobiology.

### Core Concept: One Degree of Change

Change is best approached incrementally—trying to transform everything overnight almost always fails, especially for ADHD brains.

[[The Rubber Band Metaphor for Change Capacity]] rel:: illustrates-problem

When we stretch our capacities too far, we snap back to old patterns like an overstretched rubber band. Sustainable change comes from stretching just a little, within the optimal boundary where growth is possible but not overwhelming.

### The Foundation: Understanding Your Zone

[[The Proximal Zone of Development for Habit Change]] rel:: defines-boundary

This is the sweet spot where change feels challenging but achievable—not impossible, not too easy. Growth happens here.

#### How to Find Your Zone

Listen to your internal indicators:

- **If it feels impossible** → Scale it down
- **If it feels too easy** → Nudge it up slightly
- **If you're snapping back** → You pushed too far

The zone is personal and dynamic, varying with energy levels, life circumstances, and existing capacity.

### Essential Prerequisites

#### Start With Acceptance

[[Morita Therapy - Arugamama is Accepting Reality As It Is]] rel:: prerequisite strategy:: "Accept current reality first"

Practice radical acceptance: honestly acknowledge your *current* reality—actual capacity, energy levels, existing patterns—before deciding next steps. Growth must align with where you truly are, not where you wish you were or where others expect you to be.

#### Align With Your Values

[[Habit Change Must Align With Personal Values Not External Expectations]] rel:: prerequisite principle:: "Intrinsic motivation required"

Change must answer "Why does this matter to *me*?" not "What do others expect?" For ADHD brains with interest-based nervous systems, genuine personal relevance is non-negotiable for sustained engagement.

### Core Strategies

#### 1. Start Small and Scale Gradually

[[Unrealistic expectations are the main obstacle to building ADHD routines]] rel:: explains-obstacle

[[Making a behavior easy increases the likelihood it will become a habit]] rel:: core-strategy

- Define changes within your proximal zone
- Push just enough to feel some discomfort, not so much you'll snap back
- Only increase challenge once current step feels easy and automatic
- **Example:** Start exercise at 2x/week, not 5x/week; add third session only after two feels comfortable

#### 2. Make It Easy to Execute

[[The ADHD Habit Protocol (Map-Build-Dismantle)]] rel:: complementary-framework

- Break habits into micro-steps and clear sequential actions
- Match routines to your *real* self and energy patterns, not idealized versions
- Use external cues and triggers (timers, if-then rules, habit stacking)
- Reduce friction at every step

#### 3. Track Progress and Celebrate Wins

[[Celebrating small wins builds routine momentum]] rel:: reinforcement-strategy

- Track completion externally (journal, app, simple log)
- Provide immediate feedback or reward
- Actively look for and acknowledge signs of progress
- Focus on incremental growth, not unmet goals
- Practice curiosity: look for evidence of change, no matter how small

#### 4. Reframe Setbacks Compassionately

[[Reframe Habit Setbacks as Capacity Limits Not Character Flaws]] rel:: mindset-strategy

When impatience or setbacks occur:

- Recognize failure as signal of overextension, not character flaw
- Accept that physiological/behavioral systems need time to shift
- Recalibrate: adjust the change to stay within proximal zone
- Avoid shame spirals: this is neurobiology, not moral failure

### Action Protocol

#### Step 1: Identify

Choose **one** routine or habit to improve

#### Step 2: Define Your One Degree

Determine the smallest step you can take within your proximal zone

- Write one bullet point (not a full article)
- 5-minute walk (not 30-minute run)
- One focus block (not full deep work day)

#### Step 3: Execute and Track
- Set timer for micro-habit
- Track completion externally
- Provide immediate feedback/reward

#### Step 4: Reflect Weekly
- Celebrate any sustained change, however small
- Assess: Is this still in my proximal zone?
- Recalibrate if needed

#### Step 5: Repeat

Only increase challenge once current step feels **easy and automatic**

### Why This Works for ADHD

- **Matches working memory limits:** Small steps don't overwhelm
- **Provides dopamine hits:** Frequent small wins trigger reward system
- **Reduces shame:** Compassionate attribution prevents spiral
- **Leverages interest:** Values-alignment activates engagement
- **Creates sustainable momentum:** Gradual capacity expansion prevents burnout

### Concrete Example: Building a Writing Habit

**Unrealistic (Snap-Back Risk):** "I'll write 2000 words every morning at 6 AM"

**One Degree Approach:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Open writing app and write *one sentence* after coffee (proximal zone)
2. **Week 3-4:** If one sentence feels automatic, increase to *one paragraph*
3. **Week 5-6:** If paragraph feels easy, increase to *10 minutes timed writing*
4. **Week 7+:** Continue gradual increases only when previous level is comfortable

Track each completion. Celebrate showing up. If you miss days, investigate: Was the step too big? Recalibrate down.

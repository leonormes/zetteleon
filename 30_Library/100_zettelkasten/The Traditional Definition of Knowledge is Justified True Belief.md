## The Traditional Definition of Knowledge is Justified True Belief

**Summary:** The classical definition of knowledge, originating with Plato, posits that knowledge is a "justified true belief" (JTB).

**Details:** This definition proposes three necessary conditions for something to be considered knowledge: the proposition must be true, the individual must believe it to be true, and the individual must have a valid justification for that belief. For centuries, this tripartite definition was the standard in epistemology.

In psychology and self-help, the "authentic self" refers to the version of you that operates in congruence with your core values, feelings, and beliefs. It is the self that is unfiltered by the need to perform for social approval, gain acceptance, or avoid conflict.

This alignment is often held up as a virtue because the constant suppression of one's inner experience can lead to anxiety, resentment, and a feeling of being disconnected from oneself and others. Acting from a place of authenticity is associated with higher psychological well-being.

This concept is distinct from simply acting on every impulse. A more nuanced view is that healthy authenticity involves a process of self-reflection and choice, as explored in [[Healthy Authenticity Aligns with Your Best Self Not Your Impulsive Self]].

Alchemy's methodology was deliberately arcane. It operated on the principle that truth was a form of ancient, sacred wisdom that needed protection from the uninitiated. This protection was achieved through obscurity.

Practitioners used pseudonyms, spoke in "tongues" and outlandish imagery, and concealed their knowledge in symbolism. The goal was not to illuminate and clarify for all, but to conceal and preserve for a chosen few, the "elect". This approach viewed knowledge as a static treasure to be guarded, handed down through generations, rather than a field to be corrected or expanded upon through open discourse.

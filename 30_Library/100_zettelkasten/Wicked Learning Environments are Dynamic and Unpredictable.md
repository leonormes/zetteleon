## Wicked Learning Environments Are Dynamic and Unpredictable

**Summary:** A "wicked" learning environment is dynamic, unpredictable, and provides delayed, unclear, or inaccurate feedback on actions.

**Details:** In contrast to kind environments, wicked environments lack stable rules and clear cause-and-effect relationships. Success often requires adaptability, experimentation, and the ability to synthesize information from diverse sources. Most modern work environments are considered wicked, favoring individuals with broad experience and flexible problem-solving skills over narrow specialists.

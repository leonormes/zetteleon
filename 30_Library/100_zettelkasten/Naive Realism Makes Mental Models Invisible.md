title: Naive Realism Makes Mental Models Invisible

Naive realism is the unconscious belief that we perceive the world objectively, as it truly is, rather than as a subjective interpretation through our mental models. This psychological phenomenon explains why we are largely unaware that our ideas about the world are models in our heads.

We don't experience the model itself; we experience the world *through* the model. It's like wearing spectacles with coloured lenses from birth—you wouldn't be aware of the lenses, you would simply believe the world is tinted that colour.

The neural processes that create and utilise these models are largely subconscious. They are the very architecture of our thinking, not something we consciously engage with.

This invisibility is compounded by cognitive mechanisms that reinforce the perceived accuracy of our internal models, including [[Cognitive Dissonance]] and confirmation bias.

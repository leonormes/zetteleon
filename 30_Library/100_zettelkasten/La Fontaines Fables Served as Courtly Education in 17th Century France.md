In the 17th century, Jean de La Fontaine adapted the classic fable form for the French court, creating sophisticated and witty poems that served as a tool for courtly education.

La Fontaine's fables were not just for children; they were complex works of social and political commentary aimed at an adult audience, including the aristocracy and King Louis XIV himself. They used the traditional animal allegory to subtly critique human behavior, social hierarchies, and political power.

His work cemented the fable as a respectable and influential literary form, capable of delivering nuanced moral and philosophical insights.

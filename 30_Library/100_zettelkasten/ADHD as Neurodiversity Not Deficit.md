## ADHD as Neurodiversity Not Deficit

**Summary:** ADHD represents a natural variation in brain function rather than a pathological disorder.

**Key Aspects:**
- Interest-based nervous system
- Divergent cognitive strengths
- Requires accommodation not cure

**Philosophical Connection:**
**Existential Aspect:**
ADHD cognition aligns with [[Existentialism - Existence Precedes Essence]] - creating meaning through engaged action rather than predetermined paths
**Cognitive Strengths:**
- Natural alignment with [[Absurdism as Rebellion Against Meaninglessness]] in:
  - Novelty-seeking as engagement
  - Interest-based focus as authentic action
  - Rejection of artificial productivity norms

**Implications:**
- Reduces stigma
- Validates different learning styles
- Supports workplace adaptations

Routines significantly reduce anxiety, sensory overwhelm, and decision fatigue in autistic and ADHD individuals by minimizing the cognitive load required for daily functioning and providing predictable structure that reduces the need for constant decision-making.

Event-based mini routines offer a particularly effective approach by reducing time-pressure anxiety. Rather than being tied to specific clock times, these routines trigger from natural life events (like finishing a meal or completing a work block), which minimizes the stress of clock-watching and allows for natural adaptation to daily variations in energy, motivation, and unexpected circumstances.

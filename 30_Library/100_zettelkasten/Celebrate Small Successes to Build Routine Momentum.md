Building and maintaining a routine requires motivation, which can be cultivated through positive reinforcement. Celebrating small successes helps to create a positive feedback loop that strengthens the desired behavior.

When you successfully follow a part of your routine, especially a new or difficult part, acknowledge the achievement. This can be as simple as a mental "good job" or a small, tangible reward. This practice helps to associate the routine with positive feelings, which in turn builds the intrinsic motivation needed to stick with it over the long term. It shifts the focus from perfection to progress.

## A Done List Provides Tangible Evidence of Accomplishment

**What:** A "Done" list is a past-focused log of completed tasks, designed to provide concrete, visual evidence of productivity and competence.

**How:**
1.  Keep a simple notebook, text file, or stack of index cards on your desk.
2.  Every time you complete a task, no matter how small, write it down on the list.
3.  At the end of the day, take a moment to review the list of accomplishments.

**Failure modes:**
-   Only recording "major" accomplishments, which defeats the purpose of tracking small wins.
-   Forgetting to review the list, nullifying its psychological benefit.

**Example (1 max):** After completing a micro-victory like "Created initial VPC plan," immediately write it on an index card and add it to a "Done" pile. Reviewing the growing pile at 5 PM provides a powerful antidote to the feeling of "I got nothing done today," replacing a vague sense of failure with tangible proof of progress.

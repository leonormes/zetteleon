## A Habit Becoming Part of Your Identity is the Ultimate Intrinsic Motivation

**Summary:** The most powerful form of intrinsic motivation occurs when a habit becomes fully integrated into your identity.

**Details:** This represents a mental shift from "I'm the type of person who *wants* this" to "I'm the type of person who *is* this." When your behavior and identity are aligned, you are no longer forcing change; you are simply acting like the person you believe yourself to be. The goal is not just to run a marathon, but to become a runner.

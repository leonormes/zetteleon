## Starter Tasks Address ADHD Challenges

**Summary:** Starter tasks specifically address core ADHD challenges such as executive dysfunction, paralysis, overwhelm, and dopamine deficit.

**Details:** They externalize the "how to start" decision, provide a guaranteed achievable first step, make massive tasks feel manageable, and offer quick wins that provide crucial dopamine rewards. This helps bypass the neurological barriers to task initiation common in ADHD.

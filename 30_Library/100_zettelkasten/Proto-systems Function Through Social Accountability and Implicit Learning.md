## Proto-systems Function Through Social Accountability and Implicit Learning

**Summary:** Proto-systems operate through three key features: implicit routines, social accountability, and resource pooling.

**Details:**
1.  **Implicit Routines:** Skills and processes are learned through imitation, apprenticeship, and cultural transmission, not written manuals.
2.  **Social Accountability:** Progress is tracked and enforced through public reputation, peer feedback, and social roles, not personal apps.
3.  **Resource Pooling:** Shared management of tasks and knowledge allows communities to multiply their output.

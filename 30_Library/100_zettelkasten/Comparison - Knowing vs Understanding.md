## Comparison - Knowing Vs Understanding

| Criteria        | Knowing                                  | Understanding                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**  | Possessing information                   | Constructing mental models               |
| **Demonstration** | Repetition of facts                    | Explanation and application              |
| **Cognitive Load** | High (raw data)                        | Low (compressed patterns)                |

**Key Difference:**
Understanding integrates knowledge into actionable frameworks while knowing merely accumulates facts.

**Definition:** Topology is the branch of mathematics that studies properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous deformations—such as stretching, bending, and twisting—but not tearing or gluing.

**Abstraction from Geometry:** Topology abstracts away the notion of fixed distance from geometry, focusing instead on properties like connectedness, compactness, and continuity that remain invariant under smooth transformations.

**Informal Metaphor:** Topology is sometimes described as "rubber-sheet geometry"—a coffee cup and a donut are topologically equivalent because one can be continuously deformed into the other.

**Key Concepts:** Open and closed sets, neighborhoods, continuity, homeomorphisms, and topological invariants like the number of holes (genus).

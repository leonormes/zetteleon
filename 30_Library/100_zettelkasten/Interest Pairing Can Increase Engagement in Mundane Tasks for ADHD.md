Interest pairing is a strategy for ADHD task management that involves integrating a personal interest into a mundane or non-preferred task to make it more engaging. For example, a person interested in filmmaking might film themselves doing chores, turning the activity into a more stimulating "project."

This technique leverages the interest-driven nature of the ADHD brain to boost motivation. However, it should be used with caution, as highly engaging side-tasks can lead to hyperfocus and derail the primary objective. It is most effective for short, controlled tasks.

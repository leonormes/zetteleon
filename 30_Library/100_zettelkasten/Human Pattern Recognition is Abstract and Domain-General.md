## Human Pattern Recognition is Abstract and Domain-General

**Summary:** Human pattern recognition is a domain-general competence that can be flexibly applied to abstract, hierarchical, and cross-modal problems, distinguishing it from the specialized, goal-specific abilities of most animals.

**Details:** While many animals recognize patterns for survival, their ability is often a fixed adaptation for a specific task. Humans, by contrast, can process abstract, hierarchical structures (like nested, tree-like patterns) regardless of the sensory modality. This allows us to apply the same structural logic to language, music, and visual art. This capacity for abstraction enables us to recognize patterns of patterns, forming the basis for all higher-order reasoning.

## Kind Learning Environments Are Predictable and Rule-Based

**Summary:** A "kind" learning environment is characterized by predictable patterns, clear rules, and immediate, accurate feedback on actions.

**Details:** In such environments, the relationship between actions and outcomes is straightforward and consistent. Examples include games like chess, where rules are fixed and feedback is unambiguous. Early specialization often thrives in kind environments because mastery can be achieved through repetitive practice and adherence to established procedures.

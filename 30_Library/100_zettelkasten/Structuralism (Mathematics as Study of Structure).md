**Summary:** Structuralism is a modern philosophical view that holds mathematics to be the study of abstract structures or patterns. The nature of individual objects within a structure is irrelevant; what matters is the web of relationships between them.

**Core Thesis:** The subject matter of arithmetic, for instance, is not the individual numbers themselves, but the structure of the natural number sequence (0, 1, 2, ...) defined by the "successor" relation. Any system that instantiates this structure is the natural numbers. Identity is determined by position within relational structure.

**First Principle:** The elucidation of abstract structure.

**Analogy:** A structuralist sees mathematics like music theory. It doesn't matter if a symphony is played on a piano or by an orchestra; the underlying structure of melody, harmony, and rhythm is the object of study.

**Synthesis:** This view tries to combine the best aspects of earlier philosophical schools, avoiding commitment to Platonic realms while not reducing mathematics to a mere formal game.

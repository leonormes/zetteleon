## Documenting Mental Models Enables Project Re-entry

**Summary:** Capturing your mental model while actively creating—through mind maps, flowcharts, voice memos, or written notes—creates a bridge to reconnect with complex ideas when returning to projects.

**Details:** When in flow, your mental model of a project feels vivid and complete—the hierarchy, connections, and bigger picture are present and coherent. Documenting this understanding while it's active externalizes what would otherwise be lost when you step away. Techniques include: creating visual representations like mind maps or flowcharts showing idea relationships; recording voice memos explaining your thought process and vision; or writing quick notes about key elements and their connections. This documentation serves as scaffolding to reconstruct the mental model upon return, making continuation significantly easier than starting fresh.

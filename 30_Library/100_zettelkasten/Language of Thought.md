The Language of Thought hypothesis suggests that humans possess an innate cognitive system that resembles language but is distinct from any spoken language. This internal representational system may underlie our capacity for abstract thought.

## Key Insights

- Influenced by Chomsky's work on innate language acquisition capacity
- Proposes that mental representations are structured in a language-like way
- This "mentalese" or "language of thought" is distinct from spoken languages
- May explain the universal human capacity for complex thought despite linguistic diversity

## Questions

- If a "language of thought" exists, what are its implications for our understanding of consciousness?
- Does it suggest a universal grammar of the mind that underlies the surface diversity of human languages?
- How does this internal language relate to the languages we speak?
- Is this internal language innate or developed through experience?

The foundation of any effective and sustainable routine is deep self-knowledge. Before implementing a new structure, one must first engage in a period of self-observation to understand their unique needs, patterns, and sensitivities.

This involves tracking daily activities, moods, and energy levels to identify peak performance times and periods of likely overwhelm. It is also critical to note sensory sensitivities—such as reactions to light, sound, or textures—as these environmental factors can significantly impact one's ability to follow a routine. A week of observation can reveal crucial patterns that allow a routine to be tailored to the individual, rather than based on generic advice.

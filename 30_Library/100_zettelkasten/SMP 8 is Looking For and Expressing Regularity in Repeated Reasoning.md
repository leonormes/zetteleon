## SMP 8 is Looking For and Expressing Regularity in Repeated Reasoning

**Summary:** The 8th Standard for Mathematical Practice (SMP 8), "Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning," formalizes the process of inductive reasoning in mathematics.

**Details:** This habit of mind involves noticing repeated calculations and generalizing them into a shortcut or a general method. For example, by repeatedly calculating the slope between different points on the same line, a student can be guided to abstract the general slope-intercept equation. This moves the thinker from laborious, case-by-case calculations to efficient and powerful general procedures.

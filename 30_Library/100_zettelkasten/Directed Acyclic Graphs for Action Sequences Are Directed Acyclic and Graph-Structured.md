## Directed Acyclic Graphs for Action Sequences Are Directed Acyclic and Graph-Structured

**Summary:** Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) used to model action sequences possess three key properties: they are directed, acyclic, and structured as a graph.

**Details:**
-   **Directed:** Actions flow from prerequisites to dependents, indicating a clear order.
-   **Acyclic:** There are no circular dependencies, preventing deadlocks or infinite loops in the workflow.
-   **Graph:** Complex connection patterns between actions are possible, allowing for intricate project structures.
This model clarifies what's actionable now versus what's blocked by dependencies.

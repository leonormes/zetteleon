**Habit 1: Be Proactive** is the foundation of [[The 7 Habits - The Maturity Continuum]]. It asserts that we are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. Proactive people recognize they have the responsibility and the ability to choose their response to any stimulus.

This stands in contrast to a reactive mindset, where people are driven by feelings, circumstances, and their environment.

## Circle of Concern vs. Circle of Influence

A key model for proactivity is the concept of two circles:

- **Circle of Concern:** Includes all the things we care about but have no direct control over (e.g., the national debt, global weather).
- **Circle of Influence:** Includes the things we can do something about.

Proactive people focus their time and energy on their Circle of Influence. As they work on themselves and the things they can change, their Circle of Influence grows. Reactive people focus on the Circle of Concern, which leads to blaming, victim mindsets, and a shrinking Circle of Influence.

## ProdOS Integration

This habit is a foundational mandate of the [[03 - ProdOS (Productivity Operating System)]]. The system is designed to empower the user as the "programmer" of their life, not a passive observer. It directly combats the learned helplessness that can be a challenge in [[ADHD and Productivity]] by focusing on small, controllable actions.

The next step after choosing to be proactive is to define what you want to create, which is the essence of [[Habit 2 - Begin with the End in Mind]].

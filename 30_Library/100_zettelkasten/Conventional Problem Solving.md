Conventional problem solving is an approach that operates within established knowledge frameworks and methodologies to find solutions. Rather than creating entirely new paradigms, it focuses on applying existing tools, techniques, and mental models to address challenges through incremental improvements and systematic refinement.

## Key Characteristics

- **Framework-bound**: Works within existing paradigms and established methodologies
- **Incremental progress**: Builds upon prior solutions rather than revolutionary breakthroughs
- **Pattern application**: Uses proven approaches and adapts them to new contexts
- **Risk-averse**: Relies on tested methods with predictable outcomes

## How It Works

Conventional problem solving leverages existing [[Mental Models The Developer's Internal Compass|mental models]] and established patterns to navigate challenges. It excels at optimization, refinement, and systematic improvement within known domains. This approach is particularly effective when dealing with well-understood problems that have clear precedents.

## Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths:**

- Reliable and predictable outcomes
- Builds on proven methodologies
- Lower risk of failure
- Efficient use of existing knowledge

**Limitations:**

- Can be constrained by [[Flawed Mental Models Limit Mastery|flawed mental models]]
- May miss breakthrough opportunities
- Susceptible to [[The Einstellung Effect Prevents Better Solutions|the Einstellung effect]]
- Limited by existing paradigm boundaries

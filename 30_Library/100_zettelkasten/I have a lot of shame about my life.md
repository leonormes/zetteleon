I think my [[Shame|obsession]] with [[Creating a GTD Map in Excalidraw|GTD]] and [[Zettelkasten Ain't Easy|Zettelkasten]] and trying to understand everything is driven by my shame. The shame is fed by my constant failure to meet [[Unrealistic expectations are the main obstacle to building ADHD routines|expectations]]. I do have a pathological fear of the idea of expectations, especially at work. How do I change? Is there a medicine I can take like Mounjaro that will just stop the [[Procrastination Triggers|procrastination]]? I feel this is an important line of thought

This principle strikes a crucial balance between emotional validation and personal agency. Your emotions are valid experiences that deserve acknowledgment, but how you respond to them is within your control.

## The Validation Component

Emotions are real neurological and physiological experiences. Dismissing them as "just feelings" or trying to logic them away often backfires. For individuals with ADHD, this validation is especially important because:

- [[Emotional Dysregulation]] means emotions are often more intense than neurotypical experiences
- [[ADHD Emotional Reasoning]] can make emotions feel like absolute truth
- Society often invalidates ADHD emotional experiences as "overreactions"

## The Responsibility Component

While emotions are valid, the response to them is a choice. This doesn't mean suppressing feelings, but rather:

- Recognizing that [[Emotional Reasoning]] can distort perception of reality
- Understanding that intense emotions don't automatically justify all actions
- Developing skills to manage behavior even when emotions are overwhelming

## The ADHD Context

This principle is particularly relevant for ADHD individuals who experience:

- [[Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)]] - intense emotional pain from perceived rejection
- Difficulty with emotional regulation due to neurological differences
- Social messaging that their emotional responses are "wrong" or "too much"

## Explaining to Others Enhances One's Own Learning

**Summary:** The act of teaching, preparing to teach, or even pretending to teach information to someone else—often called the "Protégé Effect"—significantly enhances one's own learning and understanding of that material.

**Details:** This strategy forces the learner to organize their thoughts coherently, process the material at a deeper level, and identify gaps or inconsistencies in their own mental models. Articulating a concept to another person (or even to oneself via self-explanation) is a powerful way to solidify knowledge.

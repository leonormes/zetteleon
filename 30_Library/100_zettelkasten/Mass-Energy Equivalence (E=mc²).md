- Energy = Mass × (Speed of Light)^2
- Mass ↔ Energy conversion underpins nuclear fission & fusion.
- Connection to **four-momentum**: energy is absolute, frame-independent.

👉 Connects to: [[Speed of Light Limit and Photons]], [[Special Relativity (Everyday Consequences)]], [[General Relativity (Gravity as Curvature)]]

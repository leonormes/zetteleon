The purpose of a budget or spending plan is not restriction, but alignment. It is a tool to ensure that your financial resources are directed toward the things you and your family truly value, a state YNAB refers to as "Spendfulness."

Arbitrary rules (like the 50/30/20 rule) often fail because they are not connected to your personal life or goals. In contrast, a value-based approach, implemented through a method like [[Give Every Dollar a Job (YNAB Rule 1)]], makes your spending a direct reflection of your priorities. This alignment is what makes a budget sustainable and effective.

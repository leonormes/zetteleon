## Confidence as Trust in Process Not Certainty in Outcomes

**Summary:** Confidence grounded in process trusts your ability to sense, decide, and adjust rather than guaranteeing particular outcomes.

**Details:** Confidence grounded in process trusts your ability to sense, decide, and adjust rather than the guarantee of a particular outcome.

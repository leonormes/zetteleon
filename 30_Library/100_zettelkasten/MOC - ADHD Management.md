## Overview

This map organizes the Source of Truth (SoT) notes regarding Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It moves from the **Pathology** (understanding the deficit) to the **Physiology** (how the brain works) and finally to the **Intervention** (strategies for thriving).

---

## 1. The Pathology: Understanding the Engine

Defining ADHD not as a character flaw, but as a specific neurobiological configuration.

-   **[[SoT - ADHD Executive Dysfunction]]** — *The Core Diagnosis.* Defines ADHD as an **Interest-Based Nervous System (IBNS)** with dysregulated executive control (Inhibition, Working Memory, Time Blindness).
-   **[[SoT - The Nature of Time and Perception]]** — *The "Time Blindness" Deep Dive.* Explains why the ADHD brain lives in "Now" vs. "Not Now" and the necessity of externalizing time.
-   **[[SoT - Learning Mechanisms]]** — *The Novelty Drive.* Explains the "Prediction Error" dopamine loop. Why we get bored once we understand the "gist" and how to hack it.

---

## 2. The Psychology: Reframing the Self

Moving from a "Deficit Model" (Shame) to a "Strength-Based Model" (Empowerment).

-   **[[SoT - ADHD Self-Compassion & Strengths]]** — *The Mindset Shift.* The "Race Car Brain with Bicycle Brakes" analogy. Strategies for "Vitamin Connect" and outsmarting the DMN "Demon" (Rumination).
-   **[[SoT - Identity-Based Habit Formation]]** — *The Identity Fix.* Dismantling the "I am lazy" belief structure and building "Repeated Beingness."

---

## 3. The Physiology: How Work Happens

The biological mechanics of getting things done.

-   **[[SoT - The Cognitive Physiology of Task Execution]]** — *The 5 Phases.* Breakdown of Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring, and Completion. Identifies where ADHD breaks the chain.
-   **[[SoT - Working Memory & Schema Theory]]** — *The Bottleneck.* Why we can't "hold it all in our heads" and need external schemas (The Extended Mind).

---

## 4. The Interventions: Tools & Protocols

Actionable strategies to regulate the system.

-   **[[SoT - Mindfulness and Emotional Regulation]]** — *Strengthening the Brakes.* Using the "Observer Self" to catch the "Glitchy Switch" between focus and distraction.
-   **[[SoT - Temporal Management (Blocking and Boxing)]]** — *Prosthetic Time.* Using Time Boxing to create artificial urgency and combat Parkinson's Law.
-   **[[SoT - The Extended Mind]]** — *Prosthetic Memory.* Offloading cognition to the ProdOS system to bypass Working Memory limitations.
-   **[[SoT - The Four Laws of Behavior Change]]** — *Habit Engineering.* Reducing friction to make the "Right Thing" the "Easy Thing."

## Small Habits Provide Evidence for a New Identity

**Summary:** The primary power of small, consistent habits is not the immediate result they produce, but the evidence they provide for a new, desired identity.

**Details:** You believe your current identity because you have proof of it. By repeating a small, positive behavior, you accumulate evidence that you are the type of person who performs that behavior. This gradual accumulation of proof is what solidifies a new identity and makes long-term change possible.

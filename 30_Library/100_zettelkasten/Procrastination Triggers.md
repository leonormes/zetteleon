Personal observations about what triggers procrastination, particularly around mundane tasks that lack immediate reward or interest.

## The Dopamine Reward Problem

"Why don't I do the dishes? It's as if doing a short one-off task like that doesn't offer any dopamine rewards. I like things to be clean and tidy. I don't get anything from the dishwasher."

This connects directly to [[The 'Dopamine Shot' vs 'Relief from Anxiety' in Task Completion]] - ADHD brains don't get the same reward satisfaction from completing mundane tasks. The underlying issue is [[Dopamine Dysregulation is a Key Factor in ADHD Motivation]], where tasks lacking intrinsic interest fail to activate the brain's reward system.

## Energy-Dependent Motivation

"My motivation is so tied to my feelings. It sounds simple. But I really do need that energy in my brain. Motivation seems to be dependent on it. I'm almost paralyzed without it."

This paralysis is a classic example of [[Thinking about the task initiation problem]] - the executive function challenge where starting tasks requires more mental energy than available. This creates the "surface tension" barrier between not doing and doing tasks.

## The Habit Formation Challenge

"I can't do little, detached tasks. So building habits is a bust."

This insight reveals why traditional habit-building advice fails for ADHD brains. Without the dopamine reward loop, habits can't form through repetition alone. This connects to [[Why Importance and Rewards Fail to Motivate ADHD Brains]] - external motivation strategies don't work when the internal reward system is dysregulated.

## The Broader Pattern

These triggers are part of [[The Shame-Procrastination Cycle]], where:

1. Tasks feel overwhelming due to lack of reward anticipation
2. Avoidance increases as the mental effort required exceeds available energy
3. Shame builds from not completing "simple" tasks
4. The cycle reinforces itself

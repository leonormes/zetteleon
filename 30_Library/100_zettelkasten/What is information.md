Data that has been processed, organized, structured, or presented in a given context to make it meaningful and useful. Information answers the basic questions of "who," "what," "where," and "when." This definition treats information as a form of [[Information as Perceivable Pattern]].

## Directly Related Concepts

The raw material for information is [[raw_data|data]]. The process of turning data into information often involves discovering the [[Information Hidden in Data]] by [[Applying Previous Knowledge|applying knowledge]] and context. This transformation is a key step in the DIKW pyramid.

A clear, practical example of this is the [[Protocol Data Unit]], where the name and structure of data change based on its context within a networking model.

## Extending the Idea

The importance of context cannot be overstated. A failure to maintain perspective leads to [[MOC Contextual Myopia]], where the meaning of information is lost.

Furthermore, our ability to interpret information is not neutral; it is shaped by [[Knowledge-Related Biases]].

This semantic view of information is one of [[Three Perspectives on Information (Map of Content)|three main perspectives]] and stands in contrast to the mathematical view, as explored in [[The Conflict Between Semantic and Shannon Information]].

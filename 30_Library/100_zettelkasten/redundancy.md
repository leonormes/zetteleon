Redundancy refers to the repetition or inclusion of extra information to make communication more reliable (e.g., for error correction).

In the context of [[Shannon's Information Theory - Information as Uncertainty|Shannon's Information Theory]], redundancy is the inverse of information. While surprising or unpredictable data has high information content, predictable and repetitive data is considered redundant. However, this technical redundancy is what makes communication robust against noise.

This technical definition is a core concept in [[What Is Information Theory|Information Theory]] and stands in contrast to the idea of [[Information as Perceivable Pattern|information as a perceivable pattern]], where some repetition is necessary for meaning to emerge.

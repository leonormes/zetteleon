## Kaizen Method Uses Micro-Victories to Build Momentum

**Summary:** The Kaizen philosophy, centered on continuous, small, incremental improvements, is a powerful tool for overcoming the paralysis induced by large, intimidating tasks, especially for the ADHD brain.

**Details:** This method involves breaking down projects into the smallest conceivable steps, or "micro-victories." Each completed micro-victory acts as a low-stakes "win," delivering a small but consistent hit of dopamine that reinforces the behavior. This steady stream of positive feedback builds momentum and gradually rewires the brain's association with the project, shifting it from a source of dread to a source of competence and satisfaction. It is a practical way to lower the activation energy barrier for any given task.

A routine's effectiveness is determined not just by its structure, but by its flexibility. Life is unpredictable, and a rigid routine will shatter at the first disruption. Therefore, building in contingency plans is essential.

For any given routine, consider what might go wrong and create a "Plan B" or even "Plan C." This proactive planning reduces the stress and decision fatigue that arise when things don't go as expected. Furthermore, having pre-determined calming strategies (e.g., using noise-cancelling headphones, stepping away for a few minutes, using a sensory object) can help manage the emotional dysregulation that often accompanies an unexpected change of plans.

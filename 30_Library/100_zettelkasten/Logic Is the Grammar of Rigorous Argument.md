**Summary:** Logic serves as the "grammar of reason" in mathematics, providing the rules for valid reasoning and the syntax for expressing mathematical structures precisely.

**Details:**

Just as natural language requires grammatical rules to form meaningful sentences, mathematics requires logical rules to construct valid arguments. Logic provides:

- **Syntax:** The formal language for expressing mathematical statements precisely
- **Rules of inference:** Valid patterns for deriving conclusions from premises
- **Semantic framework:** Methods for determining truth and validity

**Role in Mathematics:**

Logic is foundational to all mathematical activity. It enables mathematicians to:

1. Define concepts rigorously
2. State theorems precisely
3. Construct proofs that guarantee truth preservation
4. Communicate mathematical ideas unambiguously

**Metaphor:** Logic is to mathematical reasoning what grammar is to language—the structural framework that makes meaningful expression possible.

## Feynman Technique Deepens Learning Through Teaching

**Summary:** The Feynman Technique is a learning method that involves explaining concepts in simple terms as if teaching them to someone else, which reveals gaps in understanding and strengthens comprehension.

**Steps:**
1. Choose a concept to learn
2. Explain it in simple language (pretend to teach a child)
3. Identify gaps in your explanation
4. Review source material to fill gaps
5. Simplify and use analogies

**Benefits:**
- Forces deeper processing of information
- Reveals areas of weak understanding
- Creates multiple mental representations of the concept
- Develops ability to explain complex ideas clearly

**Named after:** Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, known for his ability to explain complex topics simply

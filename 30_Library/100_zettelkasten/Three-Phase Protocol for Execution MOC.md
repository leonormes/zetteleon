title: Three-Phase Protocol for Execution MOC
type: map
uid:

---

This protocol is a high-velocity framework for getting work done by systematically combating perfectionism and distraction. It prioritizes speed and ruthless focus over comprehensive preparation.

The protocol consists of three sequential phases:

1. **[[Phase 1 - The Perceptual Shift to Neutralise Perfectionism]]**: A series of mindset shifts to emotionally detach from the work and remove the pressure of finality.
2. **[[Phase 2 - Aggressive Initiation to Overcome Paralysis]]**: A set of tactics to start work immediately and build momentum, bypassing the resistance that leads to procrastination.
3. **[[Phase 3 - Compartmentalized Focus to Beat Distraction]]**: A disciplined approach to execution that involves isolating high-value tasks and single-tasking to completion.

This protocol integrates directly with the [[03 - ProdOS (Productivity Operating System)]] by providing a practical method for implementing its core principles.

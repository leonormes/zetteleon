## Literature Notes Bridge Source Material and Main Notes

**Summary:** Literature (or reference) notes contain brief citations or references from consumed media, taken while actively engaging with sources. They act as a bridge between source material and the main Zettelkasten compartment.

**Details:** Literature notes occupy the middle ground in the Zettelkasten workflow. Unlike fleeting notes (quick captures), literature notes are taken while actively consuming a specific source—book, article, video, podcast. They should contain brief citations, key quotes, and page references, but crucially they are not extensive summaries. The goal is to mark what seems important for later elaboration, not to recreate the source. These notes are typically stored in a separate reference system or compartment within the Zettelkasten. They serve as raw material that will later be processed into main/permanent notes through the act of paraphrasing and connecting to existing ideas. Luhmann avoided writing in books, preferring to note page numbers and brief descriptions on slips. The separation between literature notes and main notes ensures that the core Zettelkasten remains concept-oriented rather than source-oriented, while still maintaining connection to original sources for verification and deepening understanding.

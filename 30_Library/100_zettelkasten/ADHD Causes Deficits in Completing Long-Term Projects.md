title: ADHD Causes Deficits in Completing Long-Term Projects
type: concept

Individuals with ADHD often struggle with the completion phase of tasks, particularly for long-term projects. This is due to difficulties in organizing behaviors and planning a path to achieve long-term goals. They may lose motivation partway through a project or become distracted by new interests, making it challenging to see the project through to completion.

A specific manifestation of this challenge is the difficulty in returning to previously-started creative work. When actively creating, the mental model feels strong and coherent, wrapped in the flow of current engagement. However, when returning after a break, the mental model has dissipated, and the project's complexity becomes a barrier to re-entry. This creates a cycle where starting fresh feels easier than continuing, preventing projects from reaching completion.

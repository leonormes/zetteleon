title: The Honeyman Method uses three-tiered routines to adapt to energy variation

The Honeyman Method uses a three-tiered routine structure consisting of Ideal, Most Likely, and Minimum versions of each routine. Rather than creating a single "perfect" schedule that fails when energy dips, this framework provides three pre-planned variations that accommodate different energy and motivation states.

This approach recognizes that energy levels fluctuate significantly for neurodivergent individuals and those with chronic illness. By planning all three tiers in advance, you eliminate the cognitive load of making decisions during low-energy periods, while also removing the guilt associated with "failing" to meet unrealistic expectations.

Crucially, this method requires self-awareness of personal energy patterns and creative rhythms. Effective day architecture must be customized to the individual—there is no one-size-fits-all optimal routine. Identifying when your natural energy peaks and valleys occur enables mapping the right activities to the right tier at the right time.

The three-tier structure applies to any routine—morning, evening, work sessions, or specific tasks—allowing for consistent habit formation despite variable daily capacity.

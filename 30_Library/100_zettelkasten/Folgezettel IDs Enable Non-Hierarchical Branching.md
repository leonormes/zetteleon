## Folgezettel IDs Enable Non-Hierarchical Branching

**Summary:** Folgezettel are alphanumeric unique identifiers (like 1.1a1) that give notes permanent identity. They allow ideas to branch off in infinite non-hierarchical sequences, fundamental to bottom-up organization.

**Details:** In Luhmann's original system, Folgezettel (German for "subsequent notes") are alphanumeric IDs that alternate numbers and letters (e.g., 1, 1a, 1a1, 1a1a, 1b, 2). This structure enables ideas to branch organically without being constrained by predetermined hierarchies. When you want to develop a related idea, you create a branch using the next available letter or number. These IDs serve multiple purposes: they give each note a permanent, citable identity that persists even if the note's title changes; they create visual proximity for related ideas when browsing physically; and they embody the principle that knowledge structures emerge from connections rather than imposed categories. The manual process of assigning these IDs also introduces productive friction (eufriction), slowing down note creation just enough to encourage thoughtful placement and connection-making. In digital systems, wikilinks can replace Folgezettel functionality, but the concept remains valuable for understanding the bottom-up philosophy of Zettelkasten.

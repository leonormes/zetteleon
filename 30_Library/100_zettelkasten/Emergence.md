Emergence is a process where novel properties, systems, and patterns arise from the interactions of multiple, simpler components. Crucially, the properties of the emergent system are not present in its constituent parts.

## Key Characteristics

- Bottom-up process: Complex behaviors arise from simple interactions
- Irreducible properties: The emergent properties cannot be predicted from studying individual components alone
- Systemic novelty: New capabilities emerge that didn't exist in the parts

## Examples

- The "drive to survive" in living organisms emerges from chemical interactions, though individual carbon atoms have no survival instinct
- Consciousness emerging from neural activity
- Life emerging from chemistry

## Relationship to Dependencies

This connects to [[I Don't Like Dependencies]] - emergence shows how necessary dependencies between components can create genuinely new properties, representing a productive form of interdependence.

A powerful technique to ensure motion enables action rather than delays it is to allocate a specific, limited amount of time for preparatory activities.

By setting a timer for tasks like planning, researching, or organizing, you create a hard stop that forces a transition to action. This prevents the open-endedness that often allows motion to expand into procrastination.

For example:

- "I will research this topic for 25 minutes, and then I will start writing."
- "I will spend 15 minutes organizing my workspace, and then I will begin the task."

This method leverages the principles of [[Time-boxing]] to create structure and urgency, ensuring that the necessary preparation gets done without becoming an excuse for inaction.

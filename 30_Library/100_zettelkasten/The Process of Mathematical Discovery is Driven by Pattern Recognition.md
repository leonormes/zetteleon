## The Process of Mathematical Discovery is Driven by Pattern Recognition

**Summary:** Mathematical discovery is an iterative and creative process driven by the ability to perceive and generalize from patterns, rather than a purely linear, deductive process.

**Details:** The workflow of mathematical discovery typically begins with the observation of a regularity in a set of examples. This intuitive pattern-spotting leads to a formal conjecture or hypothesis. The conjecture is then tested, refined, and generalized. The process culminates in the search for a rigorous, logical proof to establish the universal truth of the pattern.

**Interplay with Proof:** This interplay between inductive, creative pattern-spotting (the discovery phase) and deductive, logical proof (the justification phase) is the primary engine of mathematical progress. Pattern recognition suggests what might be true; deductive proof establishes that it is true within a given axiomatic system. Both phases are essential and complementary.

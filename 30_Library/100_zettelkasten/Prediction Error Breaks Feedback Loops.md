title: Prediction Error Breaks Feedback Loops

The main mechanism that prevents the [[Cognitive-Emotional Feedback Loop]] from constantly causing problems is **reality testing** through prediction error. When the emotional consequences of our models consistently fail to match what actually happens, the brain is forced to update the model.

## How Prediction Error Works as Reality Check

The brain is not just a belief engine; it's a prediction engine. The cognitive-emotional loop constantly makes predictions about the world. When reality provides a strong prediction error signal, the loop is kept in check.

**Example Process**:

- **Model**: "Public speaking is terrifying"
- **Prediction**: Disaster will occur if I speak publicly
- **Reality**: You give a short talk, feel anxious, but receive polite applause
- **Error Signal**: The predicted disaster didn't happen—actual outcome was neutral or positive
- **Update**: This mismatch weakens the old emotional association and forces gradual model revision

## Supporting Mechanisms

**Prefrontal Cortex Override**: The brain's reasoning centre can provide "top-down" override of emotional reactions. Your inner voice of reason can intervene with rational assessment, breaking the feedback loop before it escalates.

**Social Feedback**: Other people provide crucial external reality-testing. If your model of a social situation causes anxiety, friends can provide contradictory data that serves as social prediction error, helping you realize your internal model might be inaccurate.

This principle underlies exposure therapy for anxiety and phobias—repeatedly exposing yourself to a feared situation without the expected negative consequence generates enough prediction error to rewrite faulty models.

## Identity Conflict Can Impede Positive Habit Change

**Summary:** Allegiance to an existing identity can actively prevent the adoption of new, positive habits if those habits conflict with one's established self-image.

**Details:** People may resist rational, beneficial habits if they clash with long-held beliefs like "I'm not a morning person" or "I'm bad with names." To achieve lasting change, one must be willing to edit and expand their identity, letting go of versions of themselves that no longer serve them.

While building Complex Systems as Scaffolding for ADHD Executive Functions is a valid strategy, there is a significant danger of getting perpetually stuck in the building and refining phase rather than using the system.

This form of [[Productive Procrastination as an Avoidance Strategy]] can be driven by:

- **Perfectionism**: The belief that the system must be perfect before it can be used.
- **Fear**: A subconscious fear that even this perfectly designed system won't be enough to solve the underlying problems of procrastination or overwhelm.

The core impulse to create external support is valid and necessary, but the crucial step is to shift focus from perfecting the design to consistently *using* the simplest viable version. Real-world use, however imperfect, should guide iteration, not abstract design.

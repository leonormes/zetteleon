## SMP 7 is Looking For and Making Use of Structure

**Summary:** The 7th Standard for Mathematical Practice (SMP 7), "Look for and make use of structure," codifies the brain's innate tendency to discern patterns and order.

**Details:** This mathematical habit of mind involves perceiving the underlying structure of complex mathematical expressions. For example, a proficient student sees `5 – 3(x – y)^2` not as random symbols, but as "5 minus a positive number times a square," which immediately reveals that its value can never exceed 5. This structural thinking allows for a deeper grasp of abstract concepts beyond arbitrary rules.

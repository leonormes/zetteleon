title: ADHD brains are predisposed to lean toward passive activities that offer immediate gratification

The statement "Research consistently shows that ADHD brains are predisposed to lean toward passive, low-risk activities that offer immediate gratification" is partially supported by the sources, specifically concerning "passive activities" and "immediate gratification." However, the claim about "low-risk activities" is not supported; in fact, the sources suggest the opposite for ADHD brains.

Here's a breakdown of what the sources say:

[[Predisposition to Passive Activities]]

[[Predisposition to Activities Offering Immediate Gratification]]

[[Predisposition to Low-Risk Activities]]

In summary, while ADHD brains are predisposed to seek immediate gratification and can sometimes lean towards passive (or low-effort) engagement to achieve a dopamine hit, they are generally not predisposed to low-risk activities; rather, they are often drawn to challenge and exhibit risk-taking tendencies.

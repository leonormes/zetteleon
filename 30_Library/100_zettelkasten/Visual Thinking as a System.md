Zsolt Viczián, in his book *Sketch Your Mind*, distinguishes between two modes of visual thinking:

1. **Visuals as a tool**: Sketching to clarify a concept when you are stuck.
2. **Visuals as a system**: A persistent, evolving map where sketches themselves form the knowledge structure.

The "Visual Zettelkasten" model treats each sketch as a connectable node, allowing for the visual manipulation of ideas while retaining their underlying textual depth.

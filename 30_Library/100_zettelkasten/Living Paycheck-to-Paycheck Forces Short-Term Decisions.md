Living paycheck-to-paycheck traps you in a cycle of short-term thinking. When your financial horizon extends only to the next payday, you are forced to focus exclusively on immediate survival, such as timing bill payments to income.

This constant state of financial scarcity consumes mental energy and makes it nearly impossible to plan for the future or build momentum toward larger goals. The primary goal of a robust budgeting system is to break this cycle, typically by following a principle like [[Age Your Money (YNAB Rule 4)]] to create a buffer.

## Patterns Are the Scaffolding of Knowledge

**Summary:** The ability to recognize patterns is a meta-skill for learning, serving as the essential scaffolding upon which higher-order cognitive skills are built.

**Details:** Recognizing a pattern allows a learner to make predictions about what will come next, which is fundamental to understanding order, sequence, and causality. Knowledge is not constructed by accumulating disconnected facts, but by identifying new patterns and integrating them into an increasingly complex web of existing ones. This implies that the most effective learning environments are those structured to make the underlying patterns of a domain salient and discoverable.

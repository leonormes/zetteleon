## Great Achievements Occurred Before Formal Productivity Systems

**Summary:** Humanity's greatest achievements, such as the construction of the pyramids or the Apollo 11 mission, were accomplished long before the codification of modern personal productivity systems like GTD or Atomic Habits.

**Details:** This fact highlights that while formal systems can be beneficial, they are not a prerequisite for monumental success. Progress has historically been driven by other factors, suggesting that modern frameworks are a tool, not a universal law.

Why understanding matters. When you know something you can make accurate predictions. You understand or can see how some things effect others. The wider your view the more info you have to predict things or workout the reason something is happening.

Our understanding is myopic. We don't really know what is going on. The days we have helps. We can only hold a little amount at once so the high the abstraction the more you see. Like climbing up a hill.

- Understanding enables accurate predictions.
- Understanding reveals cause-and-effect relationships.
- Broader understanding provides more information for prediction and causality.
- Human understanding is myopic/limited.
- Humans can only hold a small amount of information at once.
- Higher abstraction levels increase understanding/visibility.
- This is analogous to climbing a hill for a wider view.

Understanding allows for accurate predictions and the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships. A broader perspective provides more data for prediction and determining causality. However, human understanding is inherently limited, as individuals can only process a small amount of information simultaneously. Therefore, higher levels of abstraction improve comprehension, similar to gaining a wider view by ascending a hill.

Idea A: Understanding facilitates accurate predictions.

Idea B: Understanding allows for the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships.

Idea C: The scope of understanding directly correlates with the ability to predict and discern causality.

Idea D: Human understanding is inherently limited or "myopic."

Idea E: The cognitive capacity for processing information simultaneously is finite.

Idea F: Higher levels of abstraction enhance the breadth of understanding.

Idea G: Analogy: Gaining a wider perspective through abstraction is like climbing a hill.

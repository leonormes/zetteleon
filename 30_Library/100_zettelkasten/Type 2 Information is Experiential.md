Type 2 information is knowledge gained through direct experience and real-world action. It consists of feedback, emotional signals, and data obtained by engaging with reality rather than consuming theoretical content.

This information is irreplaceable because it provides context-specific insights that cannot be gained through [[Type 1 Information is Theoretical|theoretical study]] alone. It forces adaptation, reveals assumptions, and creates genuine learning through direct contact with consequences.

Examples include:

- Customer feedback on a product
- Results from a difficult conversation
- Physical sensations during public speaking
- Market response to a business idea
- Code behavior in production environments
- Emotional reactions to real situations

Type 2 information often challenges existing mental models and requires updating beliefs based on evidence. This makes it both valuable and potentially uncomfortable, leading some to avoid it through [[Experiential Information Avoidance|avoidance patterns]].

The acquisition of Type 2 information is often signaled by [[The Ping as a Signal for Growth|nervous system responses]] that indicate meaningful learning opportunities.

## Pattern Recognition is the Cognitive Process of Organizing Sensory Input

**Summary:** Pattern recognition is the cognitive process of organizing sensory input into meaningful structures by matching it with information retrieved from memory.

**Details:** This is an active process, not passive reception. It involves both bottom-up (data-driven) processing of raw sensory input and top-down (concept-driven) processing that applies existing knowledge and expectations. This ability allows individuals to make sense of their environment, anticipate future events, and respond appropriately.

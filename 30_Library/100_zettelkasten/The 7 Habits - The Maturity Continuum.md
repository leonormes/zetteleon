The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People provide a principle-centered framework for personal and interpersonal effectiveness. The habits are organized along a **Maturity Continuum**, moving from dependence to independence to interdependence.

1. **Dependence:** The paradigm of "you"—you take care of me; you come through for me; I blame you for the results.
2. **Independence:** The paradigm of "I"—I can do it; I am responsible; I am self-reliant. This is the goal of the **Private Victory**.
3. **Interdependence:** The paradigm of "we"—we can do it; we can cooperate; we can combine our talents. This is the goal of the **Public Victory**.

## The Private Victory (Independence)

This stage focuses on self-mastery and is the foundation for all other growth. It encompasses the first three habits:

- [[Habit 1 - Be Proactive]]
- [[Habit 2 - Begin with the End in Mind]]
- [[Habit 3 - Put First Things First]]

## The Public Victory (Interdependence)

This stage focuses on developing effective relationships and teamwork. It builds upon the foundation of independence.

- [[Habit 4 - Think Win-Win]]
- [[Habit 5 - Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood]]
- [[Habit 6 - Synergize]]

## Renewal

The final habit sustains the entire process:

- [[Habit 7 - Sharpen the Saw]]

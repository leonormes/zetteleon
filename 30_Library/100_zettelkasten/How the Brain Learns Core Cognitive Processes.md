title: How the Brain Learns Core Cognitive Processes
type:
uid: 
updated: 
version:
---

This note provides an umbrella framework for understanding the core cognitive processes that enable learning in any domain, with particular relevance to software development.

## Core Processes

[[Attention in Learning]] — `component` — Selective concentration on relevant information

[[Perception in learning]] — `component` — Organization and interpretation of sensory information

[[Memory in learning]] — `component` — Storage, retention, and retrieval systems (WM, STM, LTM)

## Application Context

[[Foundations of Learning and Cognition for Developers]] — `applied-to` — Programming-specific cognitive demands

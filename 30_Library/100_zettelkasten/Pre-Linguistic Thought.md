Pre-linguistic thought refers to cognitive processes that occur before or independent of language acquisition. Understanding the nature of thought before it's captured by linguistic structures is essential to comprehending the gap between thought and language.

## Key Insights

- Pre-linguistic thought may involve mental representations and internal symbols that stand for objects and events in the world
- Research on infants and animals suggests complex cognitive processes exist before language acquisition
- These processes include forming associations, making inferences, and navigating spatial environments
- Pre-linguistic skills (or "pre-linguistics") include joint attention and reciprocal interactions, which predict later language abilities
- These skills are crucial not just for language but for social interaction and social cognition development

## Questions

- What is the nature of the pre-linguistic world?
- How does it relate to the world we experience through language?
- Does the existence of pre-linguistic thought challenge the notion that language is necessary for abstract thinking?

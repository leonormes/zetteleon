## Respectful Budgeting is a Collaborative Process Focused on Shared Goals and Autonomy

**Summary:** Respectful budgeting is a collaborative process where partners jointly set goals, design a system for tracking expenses, and include personal spending autonomy for each individual.

**Details:** The focus of respectful budgeting is on achieving shared goals, not policing minor purchases. A key component is allocating an agreed-upon amount of money for each partner to spend with no questions asked, which empowers both individuals and preserves their dignity.

## Momentum-Based Re-Entry Points Ease Project Resumption

**Summary:** Instead of attempting to resume a project with a complex task, creating multiple small, concrete, "shallow" entry points makes it easier to get started and build momentum.

**Details:** This strategy involves breaking down the next steps into tasks that are smaller than seem necessary. Some of these can be explicitly labeled as "easy wins" or "good starting points." This lowers the activation energy required to re-engage with the project after a break.

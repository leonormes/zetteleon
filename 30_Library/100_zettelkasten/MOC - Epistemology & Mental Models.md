## Overview

This map organizes the Source of Truth (SoT) notes related to **Epistemology** (how we know what we know), **Cognition** (how we process reality), and **Meaning** (why we bother). It bridges the gap between abstract philosophy and practical cognitive performance.

---

## 1. The Map vs. The Territory (Epistemology)

Defining the limits of human understanding and the nature of our internal simulations.

-   **[[SoT - Reality, Models, and the Limits of Accuracy]]** — *The Foundation.* "The Map is Not the Territory." We never touch reality directly; we operate on internal models.
-   **[[SoT - The Thought-Language Continuum]]** — *The Medium.* How language compresses high-dimensional thought into low-dimensional symbols (The Translation Loss).
-   **[[SoT - Contextual Myopia and Self-Referential Meaning]]** — *The Distortion.* How our immediate environment creates a "Focus Bubble" that warps our sense of importance.

---

## 2. The Glitches in the System (Cognitive Biases)

Systematic errors in how we build and verify our maps.

-   **[[SoT - Illusion of Explanatory Depth (IoED)]]** — *The Knowledge Gap.* Mistaking "Familiarity" (Recognition) for "Fluency" (Understanding).
-   **[[SoT - Dunning-Kruger Effect]]** — *The Competence Gap.* Lacking the metacognition to recognize one's own incompetence.
-   **[[SoT - Social Cognition & Self-Perception]]** — *The Social Gap.* Includes the **Spotlight Effect**. How we misread others and overestimate their scrutiny of us.

---

## 3. The Search for Meaning (Existentialism)

How we generate purpose in a silent universe.

-   **[[SoT - The Philosophy of the Absurd (Camus)]]** — *The Conflict.* Accepting the "Unreasonable Silence" of the world and choosing **Revolt** over Despair.
-   **[[SoT - Logotherapy and the Will to Meaning]]** — *The Drive.* Frankl's argument that Meaning is the primary human motivation, found through creation, experience, and attitude.
-   **[[SoT - The Internal World and the Need for Validation]]** — *The Vulnerability.* The "Soap Bubble Paradox" of creative ideas and the impact of Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD).

---

## 4. The Architecture of Thought (Cognitive Science)

How the brain processes and stores these models.

-   **[[SoT - The Extended Mind]]** — *The Prosthesis.* Thinking extends beyond the brain into tools and environments.
-   **[[SoT - Working Memory & Schema Theory]]** — *The RAM.* The bottleneck of processing and how Schemas (Expertise) bypass it.
-   **[[SoT - Cognitive Architectures (Simulation vs Prototyping)]]** — *The Strategy.* The difference between "Predictive" brains and "Iterative" brains (ADHD).

## Vague Boundaries

The lack of clear-cut criteria for categorizing concepts that exist on a continuum.

## Core Examples

- [[sorites_paradox]] - The classic philosophical puzzle demonstrating this problem
- [[The Spectrum of Character - Ideals vs Defects]] - Character traits exist on continuums without clear virtue/flaw boundaries

## Mathematical Implications

- [[The Continuum Thought Experiment]] - Explores what happens without any boundaries at all
- [[Discreteness as a Precondition for Counting]] - Shows how mathematics requires clear boundaries for counting

## Practical Applications

- [[The Done State as a Boundary for ADHD Projects]] - Real-world challenge of defining "completion"
- [[Neurodevelopmental Disorders vs. Character Defects]] - Difficulty categorizing medical vs. character issues
- [[Accuracy and Precision are Independent Concepts]] - Challenges in precisely defining measurement concepts

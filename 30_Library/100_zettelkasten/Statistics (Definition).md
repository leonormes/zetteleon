**Definition:** Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data, using probabilistic models to draw inferences and make decisions in the face of uncertainty.

**Relationship to Probability:** While probability theory develops abstract models of randomness, statistics applies these models to real-world data to extract meaningful patterns and test hypotheses.

**Core Activities:**
- **Descriptive statistics:** Summarizing and visualizing data
- **Inferential statistics:** Drawing conclusions about populations from samples
- **Hypothesis testing:** Evaluating claims using statistical evidence
- **Estimation:** Quantifying uncertainty in parameters

**Purpose:** Statistics provides the mathematical tools for reasoning about uncertainty when we have observed data but incomplete information about the underlying processes.

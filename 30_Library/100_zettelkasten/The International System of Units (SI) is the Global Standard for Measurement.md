title: The International System of Units (SI) is the Global Standard for Measurement

The **International System of Units (SI)** is the modern form of the metric system and the most widely used system of measurement in the world. It provides a single, practical system of units used globally in science, technology, industry, and trade.

## The Problem It Solves

Before the SI, there was a great **diversity of units** and a **lack of coordination** between different scientific disciplines. This created inconsistency and confusion. The SI system was developed to standardise measurements and create a universal language for science and commerce.

## Core Components

The SI is built upon a foundation of:

- [[The Seven SI Base Units]]
- [[SI Derived Units Are Combinations of Base Units]]
- [[SI Prefixes Scale Units by Powers of Ten]]

The entire modern system is defined by universal, unchanging values from the natural world.

- [[The 2019 SI Redefinition is Based on Fundamental Constants]]

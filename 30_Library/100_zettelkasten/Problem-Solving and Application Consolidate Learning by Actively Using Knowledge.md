## Problem-Solving and Application Consolidate Learning by Actively Using Knowledge

**Summary:** Problem-solving and application are learning strategies that involve actively using acquired knowledge to address challenges, which consolidates understanding and makes knowledge more flexible and transferable.

**Details:** Through repeated practice and application, procedures and concepts become more automatic (schema automation), which reduces cognitive load and frees up working memory to focus on more complex, strategic aspects of a problem. This moves learning beyond mere recall into higher-order cognitive operations.

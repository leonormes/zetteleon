**Predictive Processing** (or the **Bayesian Brain** hypothesis) is the leading modern theory for how the brain uses mental models. It posits that the brain is not a passive receiver of sensory information, but an active and constant **prediction machine**.

The process works in a continuous loop:

1. **Prediction:** Your brain uses its current mental model to generate a prediction of the next wave of sensory input it expects to receive.
2. **Sensory Input:** Your senses deliver the actual information from the world.
3. **Error Signal:** The brain compares its prediction to the actual sensory input. The difference between them is the **"prediction error."**
4. **Model Update:**
   - If the prediction was accurate, the error is low, and your confidence in your model is strengthened. The brain efficiently ignores the expected.
   - If the prediction was wrong, a large prediction error signal is generated. This signal forces the brain to update its mental model to better match reality.

According to this view, what we consciously perceive is not the raw sensory data, but our brain's best guess—its current working model. The only information that typically bubbles up to our conscious awareness is the "error signal," which is why we notice the unexpected far more than the expected.

This mechanism is what [[Prediction Error Breaks Maladaptive Feedback Loops|breaks maladaptive feedback loops]] and is the engine of learning. The biochemical consequence of this process is that [[Prediction Error Drives Dopamine Release]].

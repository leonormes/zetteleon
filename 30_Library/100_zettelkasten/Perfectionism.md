## Perfectionism

Perfectionism is a mindset where the desire to achieve an ideal or "perfect" standard becomes a significant barrier to action.

This often manifests as **analysis paralysis**, where endless planning and fear of making a "wrong" choice prevent any practical progress. The fear of creating a "mess" or producing substandard work can stop a task before it even begins.

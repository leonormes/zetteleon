## Commercial Music is Engineered for Mass Appeal by Specialist Teams

**Summary:** Unlike the solitary artist or band, commercial music is often created by large teams of specialists and is engineered to appeal to the widest possible audience.

**Details:** The creation process may involve "songwriting camps" with dedicated producers, hook writers, lyricists, and even data analysts. The music is specifically designed to sound great on the radio, be catchy in the first 15 seconds, and follow the established "rules" of popular music to ensure it is easily consumable.

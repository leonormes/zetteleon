**Embarrassment** is generally a less intense and more fleeting emotion than shame or humiliation. It arises from an awareness of having committed a socially awkward, inappropriate, or unacceptable act that has been, or might be, witnessed by others. The focus is on a specific behaviour or situation that is perceived as a minor social misstep. While uncomfortable, embarrassment doesn't usually involve a fundamental questioning of one's self-worth in the same way shame does, nor the profound sense of being devalued that accompanies humiliation. Embarrassment is often self-inflicted through a mistake or social gaffe.

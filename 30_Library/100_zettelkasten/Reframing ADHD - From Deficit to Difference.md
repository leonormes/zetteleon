A crucial mindset shift in understanding Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is to reframe it from a **deficit-based model** to a **difference-based model** of neurodiversity.

## From Disorder to Neurodiversity

- **The Deficit View**: Traditionally, ADHD has been viewed as a disorder—a collection of deficits that need to be "fixed" or "cured." This perspective often leads to societal stigma and personal shame, framing challenges with executive functions as moral failings like "laziness" or a "lack of willpower."
- **The Neurodiversity View**: This modern perspective sees the ADHD brain as simply "wired differently." It is a natural variation in human brain function, not a character flaw. This view is foundational to understanding the unique motivational and processing styles of the ADHD brain, such as [[The Interest-Based Nervous System in ADHD]].

## The Impact of Reframing

Adopting a neurodiversity paradigm has profound implications:

1. **Reduces Stigma and Shame**: It combats the harmful societal misconceptions that fuel stigma. By understanding ADHD as a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting the brain's structure and chemistry, we can move away from judgmental labels and toward empathy and acceptance.
2. **Promotes Self-Compassion**: For individuals, this reframe is a powerful act of self-compassion. It allows them to see their struggles not as personal failures, but as predictable challenges arising from a mismatch between their brain's operating system and a world largely designed for neurotypicals. This is especially important for those diagnosed later in life who have a history of overcoming significant, unsupported difficulties.
3. **Fosters Effective Strategies**: By removing the lens of pathology, we can focus on creating accommodations and leveraging strengths, rather than trying to force the ADHD brain to operate like a neurotypical one. It shifts the focus to building supportive environments and using strategies that work *with* the ADHD brain, not against it.

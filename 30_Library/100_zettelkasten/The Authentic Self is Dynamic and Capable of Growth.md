The "authentic self" is not a fixed or static entity; it is dynamic and evolves over time. Authenticity, in this sense, is not about clinging to an unchanging core, but about a continuous process of self-awareness, honesty, and growth.

If one discovers that their authentic reactions or traits are negative (e.g., petty, entitled), true authenticity involves acknowledging these aspects without judgment. This self-knowledge then becomes a valuable starting point for personal development. The authentic path is to take responsibility for these traits and actively work towards growth and change, aligning with one's evolving higher values.

This perspective reframes perceived flaws not as permanent defects, but as areas for authentic development, emphasizing that the journey of becoming is central to being authentic.

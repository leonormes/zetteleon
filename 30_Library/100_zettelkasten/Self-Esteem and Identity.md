Our sense of self is often shaped, at least in part, by how others see us. Positive feedback and validation can boost self-esteem, while criticism, especially if it hits on an area of insecurity, can be deeply unsettling. If a significant part of your identity is tied to your ideas, having them dismissed can feel like a personal rejection.

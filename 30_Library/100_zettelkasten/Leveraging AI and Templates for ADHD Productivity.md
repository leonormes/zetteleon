## Leveraging AI and Templates for ADHD Productivity

For individuals with ADHD, offloading cognitive load is a critical productivity strategy. Two powerful methods for this are using AI-powered tools and templatizing repetitive workflows.

### Core Concepts

1. **AI as an Executive Assistant**: Modern AI tools can act as an external "executive function," handling tasks that are particularly challenging for the ADHD brain. This includes:
    - **Meeting Transcription and Summarization**: Tools like Granola can transcribe meetings, identify action items, and create a searchable record, compensating for in-the-moment distraction or memory lapses.
    - **Brain-Dumping and Structuring**: Using voice-to-text features in AI tools (like ChatGPT or Notion AI) allows for unstructured "brain dumps" that the AI can then organize into coherent outlines, plans, or summaries. This bypasses the friction of self-editing and structuring initial thoughts.

2. **Templatizing Everything**: Creating reusable templates for common, multi-step processes dramatically reduces the cognitive load required to start a task. Instead of rebuilding the workflow from scratch each time, you can activate a pre-made checklist or document.
    - **Examples**: Client onboarding, content creation scripts, project reports, weekly planning.

### Why It Works for ADHD

- **Reduces Activation Energy**: Templates and AI-driven structuring lower the initial barrier to starting a task.
- **Offloads Working Memory**: These systems act as an external memory, holding the details of a process so the brain doesn't have to.
- **Bypasses Perfectionism**: AI can help turn a messy brain dump into a usable first draft, short-circuiting the perfectionist tendency to get stuck on finding the "right" way to start.
- **Ensures Consistency**: Templates ensure that important steps aren't forgotten, which is a common issue with executive dysfunction.

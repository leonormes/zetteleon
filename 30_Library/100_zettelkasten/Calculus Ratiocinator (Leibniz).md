The calculus ratiocinator (Latin for "calculus of reasoning") was Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's theoretical framework for a universal problem-solving machine or method. It was intended to operate on the concepts expressed in his [[Characteristica Universalis (Leibniz)]]. Once a problem was translated into the universal language, the calculus ratiocinator would mechanically perform logical deductions to arrive at a solution. It stands as a foundational concept for automated reasoning and mechanical computation.

## Analog and Behavioral Techniques Are Crucial for ADHD Management

**Summary:** Simple, non-digital behavioral techniques are invaluable for managing ADHD, as digital tools can sometimes become a source of distraction.

**Details:** Key strategies include the "brain dump," where all thoughts are written on paper to clear mental clutter. To overcome task initiation inertia, the "five-minute rule" (committing to a task for just five minutes) and "micro-starts" (doing the smallest possible action) are effective. The Pomodoro Technique—short, focused work intervals with breaks—is a cornerstone strategy for managing time blindness and preventing burnout.

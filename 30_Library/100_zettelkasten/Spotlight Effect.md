## Spotlight Effect

**Summary:** The spotlight effect is the cognitive bias causing people to drastically overestimate how much others notice and remember their flaws, mistakes, or awkward behaviors—as if a spotlight follows them highlighting every imperfection.

**Details:**

- **Mechanism**: Egocentric bias leads us to assume our internal experience (heightened self-awareness) is shared by observers, when in reality others are focused on their own concerns
- **Magnitude**: Research shows people typically overestimate others' attention by 200-300%—if you believe 10 people noticed your mistake, likely only 2-3 actually did
- **Temporal distortion**: The effect extends to memory—you assume others remember your gaffes when they've likely forgotten within minutes
- **Impact on behavior**: Creates excessive self-monitoring, inhibition of authentic expression, and social anxiety; paradoxically makes genuine connection harder

**Examples:** Obsessing over a mispronounced word in a presentation while the audience has already moved on; believing everyone noticed your stained shirt when most didn't.

**Why it persists:** Privileged access to our own thoughts creates an illusion that our internal state is visible to others; lack of direct feedback allows the belief to persist unchallenged.

Rather serendipitously, this guy mentioned not taking all the information but instead distilling it to just the important stuff.

When I read an interesting book, indecision compels me to want to retain all the knowledge. If I thought about it properly, I would choose the things I wanted to learn.

The networking subject is a good example. It is all new and technical. Perfect for my flavour of ADHD obsession. Not commonly known by those around me. Clever. Vast subject. Important. Hard.

[[Information as Foundation of Knowledge]]

But I only learn by 1 thought at a time.

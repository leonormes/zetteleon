## Shift from Seeking Rightness to Seeking Utility

**Summary:** Since objective "rightness" is an unattainable goal, a more stable foundation for confidence is "utility" or "effectiveness."

**Details:** This pragmatic approach involves shifting the primary question from "Is this belief true?" to "Is this belief useful? Does it lead to a better outcome?" Confidence is no longer derived from a brittle claim to objective truth, but from experience and evidence that a given course of action is effective and aligned with one's chosen principles. This is closely related to the idea of focusing on systems that work, rather than abstract goals.

title: SI Prefixes Scale Units by Powers of Ten

**SI prefixes** are used to create decimal multiples and sub-multiples of SI units. This allows scientists to express very large or very small quantities conveniently without resorting to scientific notation in all cases.

## How They Are Used

The prefixes are always a power of ten, making conversion straightforward.

- **kilo- (k)** represents $10^3$ (a thousand). A kilometre (km) is 1,000 metres.
- **milli- (m)** represents $10^−3$ (a thousandth). A milligram (mg) is 0.001 grams.
- **nano- (n)** represents $10^−9$ (a billionth). Nanotechnology operates on the scale of nanometres (nm).

This decimal-based approach is a core feature of the SI system, eliminating the complex arithmetic found in systems like the imperial system.

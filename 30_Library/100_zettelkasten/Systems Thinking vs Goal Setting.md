Systems thinking is an approach to progress that focuses on consistently executing simple, repeatable actions (the system) rather than obsessing over a specific outcome (the goal). While goals are useful for setting a direction, systems are what actually enable progress.

A key distinction is that goals are temporary—they end once achieved—while systems are ongoing and designed to become habits. This makes systems more resilient and less dependent on motivation.

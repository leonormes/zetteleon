The Five-Item To-Do List is a strategy designed to combat the analysis paralysis and overwhelm that a long, scrolling task list can induce.

The method is to limit a daily to-do list to just five items. Crucially, these are not necessarily the five *most important* tasks, but simply the first five that come to mind that require attention. This approach drastically lowers the cognitive load of prioritization and reduces decision fatigue, making the list feel manageable and achievable.

Completing a short list provides a clear sense of accomplishment and a dopamine reward, which helps build momentum for the next day.

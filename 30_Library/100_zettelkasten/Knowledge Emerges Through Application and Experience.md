## Knowledge Emerges Through Application and Experience

**Summary:** Knowledge is formed when a person can apply information in practical situations to solve problems, make decisions, or gain new insights.

**Details:** The act of using information in real-world contexts develops a more nuanced and actionable understanding than purely theoretical learning. Experience transforms abstract data into practical wisdom. This aligns with the concept of [[Type 2 Information is Experiential]].

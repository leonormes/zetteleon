One of the most effective ways to manage [[High-Frequency Micro-Spending Drains Resources|high-frequency impulse spending]] is to introduce intentional friction into the purchasing process. When spending is too easy, it often happens without conscious thought.

By setting firm, proactive budget limits for problematic categories (like coffee or dining out), you force a moment of consideration. When the category is empty, you must make a conscious choice to [[Roll With the Punches (YNAB Rule 3)|move money from another goal]], creating a tangible sense of the trade-off. This friction transforms a mindless habit into a deliberate decision.

External validation—having one's thoughts or beliefs confirmed by others—is a powerful tool for reducing [[Cognitive Dissonance]]. This is part of [[Why External Validation is So Powerful]].

It provides a sense of certainty and alleviates the psychological discomfort that arises from holding conflicting beliefs, thereby reinforcing one's position, which can be a form of Confirmation Bias.

title: The Illusion of Shared Understanding in Teams

In a team, there is often an illusion that a single, shared mental model of a system exists. In reality, the "team model" is a fragile patchwork of each member's individual, differing, and often tacit models.

We cognitively shortcut to assuming alignment because it is more efficient than constant verification. This false consensus persists until a crisis or complex failure, at which point the differing underlying models cause confusion, conflicting actions, and chaotic incident response.

[[Bug in the model]]

The illusion of shared understanding occurs when members of a team believe they are aligned on a concept because they use the same terminology, but their underlying individual mental models are actually different.

This is caused by [[Semantic Diffusion Creates False Alignment]] and the fact that most knowledge is .

For example, a team can discuss the number "infinity" ($\infty$). One person may hold a flawed model of it as just a very large, specific number (a location). Another may hold the more correct model of (a direction/process). They agree on the word but have a fundamental misalignment that will only surface during a crisis or deep technical discussion.

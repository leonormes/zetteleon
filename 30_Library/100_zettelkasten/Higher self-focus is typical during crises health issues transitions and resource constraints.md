title: Higher self-focus is typical during crises health issues transitions and resource constraints

Higher-than-average self-focus is a normal and expected response in certain life contexts and situations. These contexts include:

1. **Personal crises or high stress periods** - Times of acute stress naturally narrow attention to immediate needs
2. **Health issues** - Managing physical or mental health concerns requires self-directed attention
3. **Major life transitions** - Events like career changes, moves, or relationship changes demand personal focus
4. **Professional performance contexts** - Situations where individual performance matters
5. **Managing limited resources** - When dealing with constrained time, energy, or money

In these situations, increased self-focus serves an adaptive function and does not indicate social dysfunction.

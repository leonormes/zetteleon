## Generalists Have an Advantage in the Information Age

**Summary:** In the modern information age, generalists who can connect ideas across diverse fields often have a significant advantage over narrow specialists.

**Details:** While specialists thrived when knowledge was scarce, the current era is characterized by an abundance of information. New insights and solutions frequently emerge from the synthesis of disparate domains. Generalists excel at identifying these connections, fostering innovation and adaptability in complex, rapidly changing environments where hyper-specialization can become a liability.

Motion feels productive because it often mimics the activities associated with work. An individual can be busy, engaged, and focused while in a state of motion.

However, this feeling is a form of self-deception. Motion without action is merely a performance of productivity. It generates the appearance of progress without producing any tangible outcomes.

This is the core of its appeal as a procrastination tactic: it allows a person to get the psychological satisfaction of "working" without facing the risks and challenges of actual work. It is theater, not substance.

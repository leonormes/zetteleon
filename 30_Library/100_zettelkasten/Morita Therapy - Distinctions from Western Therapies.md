[[Morita Therapy]] offers a distinct approach compared to many Western psychotherapies, particularly those that focus on cognitive restructuring (like CBT).

Key distinctions include:

- **Acceptance over Control:** It accepts difficult emotions as natural and temporary, rather than viewing them as symptoms to be controlled or eliminated.
- **Behavioral over Cognitive Change:** The primary focus is on changing one's behavior and actions, with the understanding that feelings will often follow, rather than trying to change thoughts first.
- **Present Action over Past Analysis:** The therapy is forward-looking and action-oriented, placing less emphasis on analyzing past events and more on what one can do in the present moment.
- **Doing over Feeling:** It values purposeful doing as the path to a meaningful life, rather than prioritizing the achievement of a specific emotional state (e.g., "happiness").

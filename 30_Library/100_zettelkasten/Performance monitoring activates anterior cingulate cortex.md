## Performance Monitoring Activates Anterior Cingulate Cortex

**Summary:** Performance monitoring during task execution is generated mainly in the medial frontal cortex, specifically the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is essential for error detection and adaptive behavior adjustment.

**Details:** The ACC mediates adaptation of goal-directed behavior and provides neural signals for response adjustments after errors and whenever decisions are risky or uncertain. Event-related electrical activity during stimulus processing includes the N2 component (representing detection of uncertainty, mismatch, and conflict) and the P3 response (relating to resource allocation for task performance). Response-locked activity includes the error-related negativity (ERN) occurring 50-100ms after incorrect responses with fronto-central distribution, reflecting post-response conflict and rapid internal error detection. The ACC is critical for detecting when performance deviates from goals and signaling the need for control adjustments.

**Network Integration:** The ACC works within the broader performance monitoring system that includes fronto-striatal networks and connects to the lateral prefrontal cortex for implementing behavioral adjustments.

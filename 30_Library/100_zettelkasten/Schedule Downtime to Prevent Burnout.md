A common failure mode for routines is overscheduling, which inevitably leads to burnout. To create a sustainable system, it is critical to intentionally and explicitly schedule downtime and breaks.

Rest is not what happens when you have nothing else to do; it is an essential component of the routine itself. Scheduling breaks for relaxation, hobbies, or simply doing nothing prevents the buildup of fatigue and helps maintain the energy required to engage with more demanding tasks. A routine without planned downtime is a recipe for exhaustion and eventual abandonment of the system.

System tweaking is a common form of productive procrastination for individuals with ADHD, where they spend excessive time refining the appearance, functionality, or organization of their tools (like a PKM or to-do list) instead of using them to do the actual work.

This behavior is highly engaging for the ADHD brain because it activates several key motivators at once:

- **Novelty**: Creating new layouts, functions, or aesthetics.
- **Challenge**: The intellectual puzzle of problem-solving ("How do I get this to work?").
- **Interest**: It is often a creative, hands-on task.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Every successful tweak provides an instant, small reward (a dopamine hit).

The brain can get locked into this rewarding loop of "perfecting the system" because it is more stimulating than the often mundane work the system was designed to manage. This is a state of [[Hyperfocus is a State of Intense Interest-Driven Focus in ADHD]] misapplied.

This is a key problematic pattern described in [[The Duality of Novelty Seeking in ADHD]].

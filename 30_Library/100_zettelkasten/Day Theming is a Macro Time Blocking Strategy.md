## Day Theming is a Macro Time Blocking Strategy

**Summary:** Day theming is a time management strategy that assigns a specific focus or type of work to each day of the week.

**Details:** This is a form of macro-level time blocking. For example, a week might be structured as "Admin Mondays," "Client Meeting Tuesdays," or "Creative Work Wednesdays." This approach brings a high level of focus and structure to the week, allowing for deep dives into specific areas of responsibility.

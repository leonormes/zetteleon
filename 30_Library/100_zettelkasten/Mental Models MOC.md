This collection of notes explores the concept of **Mental Models**: the internal, simplified representations of reality that our brains use to navigate the world, make predictions, and guide action. For a broader exploration of thought and language, see [[Thought and Language]].

## The Nature of Mental Models

- Our fundamental unawareness of our models is explained by [[Naïve Realism Makes Mental Models Invisible]].
- They are efficient, subconscious tools for survival, acting as [[Mental Models as Evolutionary Filters]] and can be influenced by personality traits like extraversion as seen in [[Extravert]]. For thinking processes, see [[The Drill Down Phase of Thinking Follows Brainstorming]]. For uncertainty reduction, see [[MOC Uncertainty Reduction]].
- The core paradox is that [[All Models Are Wrong But Some Are Useful]].
- The general scientific principle behind them is [[The Science of Modelling and Abstraction]].

## How Models Are Built and Reinforced

- The brain builds models based on what it deems important, meaning [[Salience and Emotion Shape Mental Models]].
- This creates a powerful [[The Cognitive-Emotional Feedback Loop]] where models and emotions influence each other.
- We must actively fight the internal barrier to growth known as **Resistance** by [[The War of Art - Resistance and Turning Pro|Turning Pro]].
- This loop is kept in check when reality provides a strong enough signal, as [[Prediction Error Breaks Maladaptive Feedback Loops]].

## The Neuroscience of Models

- The modern understanding of the brain is as a [[The Brain as a Distributed Prediction Machine]].
- The dominant theory for how this works is [[Predictive Processing and the Bayesian Brain]].
- The mechanism for learning and motivation is that [[Prediction Error Drives Dopamine Release]].

## The Social and Evolutionary Dimension

- In social contexts, we use them as [[Mental Models as Social Status Signals]].
- Our ability to understand each other relies on [[Shared Biology and Mirror Neurons Enable Model Sharing]].
- Our species' dominance is due to the fact that [[Collective Intelligence is Enabled by Communication]], allowing us to share and accumulate models over generations.
- The evolutionary origin of this sense-actuate system can be seen in [[Chemotaxis as a Primitive Precursor to Emotion]].

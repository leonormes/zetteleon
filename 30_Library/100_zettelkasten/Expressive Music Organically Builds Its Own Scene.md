## Expressive Music Organically Builds Its Own Scene

**Summary:** Music born from authentic expression often builds its own culture and community organically, starting outside of mainstream systems.

**Details:** Genres like early house, punk, and hip-hop did not start on the radio. They began in basements, warehouses, parks, and small clubs where people gathered around the music itself. This process creates a holistic culture, including fashion, language, and dance, that grows from the ground up.

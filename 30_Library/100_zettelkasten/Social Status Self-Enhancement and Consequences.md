## Social Status Self-Enhancement and Consequences

**Summary:** Social status self-enhancement occurs when individuals consistently overestimate their standing, likability, or competence relative to how the group actually perceives them—a pattern that typically leads to social penalties rather than rewards.

**Details:**

- **Definition**: Persistent gap where self-perceived status > actual status as rated by peers, colleagues, or group members
- **Mechanism**: Combination of positive illusions, lack of accurate feedback, selective attention to confirming signals, and misinterpretation of polite behavior as genuine admiration
- **Social costs**:
  - Reduced trust from group members who perceive arrogance or overconfidence
  - Lower acceptance and likability (groups punish perceived "hubris")
  - Reduced influence—overestimators are taken less seriously
  - Missed learning opportunities due to false confidence
- **Less common than underestimation**: Contrary to popular belief, most people actually underestimate their acceptance and likability (see [[Liking Gap]]); status self-enhancement is the exception rather than the rule

**Corrective interventions:**

- Seek specific, actionable feedback from trusted sources
- Track outcome metrics (collaboration invitations, follow-up contacts) as objective status proxies
- Cultivate at least one relationship with someone who provides honest, critical feedback
- Use [[Reality Testing]] frameworks to test status assumptions against behavior

**Related to**: [[Mental Models as Social Status Signals]]—others infer competence from demonstrated model quality, not self-reported status.

title: The Seven SI Base Units

The **International System of Units (SI)** is founded on seven base units, each corresponding to a fundamental physical quantity. All other units can be derived from these seven.

| Quantity                  | Unit Name | Symbol |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Time                      | second    | s      |
| Length                    | metre     | m      |
| Mass                      | kilogram  | kg     |
| Electric current          | ampere    | A      |
| Thermodynamic temperature | kelvin    | K      |
| Amount of substance       | mole      | mol    |
| Luminous intensity        | candela   | cd     |

The kilogram is unique as it is the only base unit whose name includes a prefix. These units are no longer defined by physical objects but by fundamental constants of nature, which makes them inherently stable and universal.

Several community plugins can enhance the functionality of Excalidraw in Obsidian:

- **ExcaliBrain**: By the same developer, this plugin generates interactive, structured mind maps of your vault by interpreting links, folders, and dataview fields. It visualizes relationships as parent, child, sibling, and friend nodes.
- **Dataview**: Allows you to query your notes as a database. It is a dependency for ExcaliBrain and can be used to display filtered lists of notes within an Excalidraw canvas.
- **Templater**: Automates note and canvas creation. You can create templates for new Excalidraw drawings with pre-defined layouts or icons.
- **Advanced Slides**: Allows you to present your Excalidraw canvases as fullscreen slideshows.
- **Obsidian Canvas Enhancer**: Adds more flexible navigation and styling to visual canvases.

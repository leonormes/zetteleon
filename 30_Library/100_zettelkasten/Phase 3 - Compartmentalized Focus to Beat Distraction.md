title: Phase 3 - Compartmentalized Focus to Beat Distraction

Following [[Phase 2 - Aggressive Initiation to Overcome Paralysis]], the final phase of the [[Three-Phase Protocol for Execution MOC]] is to establish a routine of ruthless, compartmentalized focus. This is designed to beat distraction and overwhelm during the execution of the work.

1. **Isolate and Eliminate Distraction:** Create a "deep work" environment by turning off all notifications and removing potential interruptions. This aligns with the concept of using specific contexts like `@DeepWork` as defined in [[09 - Todoist for Task Execution]].
2. **Identify and Leverage High-Value Tasks:** Focus only on Key Result Areas (KRAs) or Income Generating Tasks (IGTs) during peak energy windows. This is a direct implementation of the [[03 - ProdOS (Productivity Operating System)]] "Compass Over Clock" principle.
3. **Follow the Process and Single-Task:** Break the task into manageable pieces and focus only on the present action. The **Pomodoro Technique** is an excellent method for enforcing this, which is a core concept in [[11 - Time Management (Timeboxing and The Unschedule)]].
4. **Use a "To Leverage" List:** Aggressively delegate or eliminate low-value tasks ("posteriorities"). This frees up mental and emotional energy to focus on your core strengths and most important work.

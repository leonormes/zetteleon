The most crucial distinction in personal knowledge management is between PKM as a **product** (a personal wiki) and PKM as a **process** (a thinking partner).

## Product-Oriented PKM

- Creates polished, wiki-style entries
- Focuses on final conclusions and clean summaries
- Presents information as if it were always known
- Reads like reference material
- Hides the thinking process

## Process-Oriented PKM

- Captures the messy journey of discovery
- Shows questions, false starts, and gradual connections
- Documents uncertainty and evolving understanding
- Reveals the trail of thoughts that led to insights
- Makes thinking visible and reviewable

The value isn't in the summary note itself; it's in the rich, contextual, personal network of notes it sits on top of.

Regularly scheduling the same types of tasks at the same times creates a powerful rhythm and fosters [[Habit Formation|habit formation]].

When a specific time block is consistently dedicated to a particular activity (e.g., writing every morning from 8 to 9 AM), the need to decide whether or when to work is eliminated. The schedule itself becomes the cue for action.

This consistency reduces the friction of starting and helps to automate the behavior, making it easier to perform the desired task regularly without relying on motivation or willpower.

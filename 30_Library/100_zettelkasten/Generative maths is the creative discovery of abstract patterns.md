title: Generative maths is the creative discovery of abstract patterns

Source: [[The Two Views of Maths]]

The Idea (In Detail):

This is the work of a research mathematician. It is a creative and exploratory process focused on discovering new patterns and structures. It asks foundational questions: "What are the properties of this abstract object?", "Can I prove this pattern holds true in all cases?", "Does a pattern even exist here?". The goal is to generate new tools, new understanding, and new fields of thought, rather than just applying old ones.

My Thoughts & Implications:

This is "maths as art" or "maths as philosophy". It's about exploration and creation. This is the part of maths that resonates with my own thinking, but it's completely hidden in most curricula. A key implication is that the skills required for generative maths (e.g., abstract reasoning, creativity, comfort with ambiguity) are very different from those for applicative maths (e.g., precision, procedural accuracy).

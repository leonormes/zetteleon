This aspect is strongly supported in the sources. The ADHD brain's motivation system is notably different, with "dopamine dynamics" playing a crucial role. Tasks that are not inherently interesting, novel, stimulating, or those that do not offer an immediate or tangible reward, may not trigger a sufficient dopamine response to initiate or sustain engagement. The ADHD brain is "highly attuned to immediate relevance and reward". Strategies to manage ADHD often involve leveraging this need for immediate gratification, such as:

- Micro-rewards and Gamification: Pairing the completion of tasks with immediate, pre-defined micro-rewards or turning a series of actions into a game can provide the rapid reinforcement that ADHD brains crave and respond well to.
- "Quick Wins": An adapted "2-minute rule" for ADHD focuses on tasks that can be completed quickly and provide an immediate, satisfying sense of closure, leading to a small dopamine boost and motivation.
- False Sense of Accomplishment: Even the act of planning or defining "Next Actions" can provide a temporary dopamine hit, leading to a "false sense of accomplishment" that saps motivation for the actual execution of tasks, as the future benefits are less compelling than immediate planning satisfaction.

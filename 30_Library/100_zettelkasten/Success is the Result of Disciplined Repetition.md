Success is not the result of a single event, but the accumulation of relentless, repetitive, disciplined actions over time. What often appears as "luck" or "talent" is, in reality, the visible outcome of thousands of small, consistent choices stacked on top of each other.

## Historical Examples

Throughout history, great achievements came from systematic repetition:

- **Medieval stonemasons** applied incremental improvement over decades
- **Great writers** maintained rigid, non-negotiable daily writing schedules
- **Renaissance artists** mastered technique through years of repetitive practice in apprenticeship systems
- **The Apollo program** succeeded through thousands of repeated procedures and simulations

Discipline is not a magical well of willpower; it is the *result* of a good system that you have practiced repeatedly.

## Modern Codification

What we now call "atomic habits" or "compound effect" are simply modern names for eternal principles that effective people have always used, whether consciously or intuitively.

title: Open Knowledge Systems Prevail Over Closed Systems

The historical trajectory of alchemy and mathematics suggests that open, transparent systems of knowledge are more robust and enduring than closed, esoteric ones.

In the 17th century, both seemed to be flourishing. However, with hindsight, alchemy was the "last blossom from a dying plant," while mathematics was the "first blooming of a hardy perennial."

Systems that rely on open demonstration, logic, and refutation (like mathematics and modern science) are self-correcting and generative. Systems that rely on secrecy and protected authority (like alchemy) are brittle and ultimately stagnate. The success of the latter depends on belief, while the success of the former rests on proof.

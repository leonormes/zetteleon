Minimum routines are bare-bones plans designed for low-energy, high-dysregulation, or executive dysfunction days. This tier strips routines down to the absolute essentials—activities so basic that they remain achievable even during periods of severe depletion or impairment.

For example, a minimum morning routine might consist of: letting the dog out briefly (not walking), eating cereal or a grab-and-go breakfast, staying in pajamas, and completing only minimal hygiene like brushing teeth. The bar is intentionally set low enough that completion feels genuinely attainable rather than aspirational.

The minimum tier serves two critical functions: it maintains the routine structure (preventing complete abandonment of habits) while eliminating guilt by acknowledging that some days, basic self-care and survival are sufficient victories. This tier recognizes that maintaining any version of a routine during difficult periods preserves the habit infrastructure for easier days.

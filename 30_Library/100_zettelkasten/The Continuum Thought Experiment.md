Imagine a universe that is a single, perfectly uniform energy field—a perfect continuum with no distinct parts. In such a universe, the concept of number breaks down.

- You cannot count "one" of something because there is no boundary to separate it from "the rest".
- Without the possibility of a "two", the concept of "one" (representing the whole) loses its meaning as a quantity.

This thought experiment reveals that [[Discreteness as a Precondition for Counting]] is a foundational requirement for arithmetic to apply to reality.

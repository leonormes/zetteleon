**Summary:** Once a person with ADHD has explored the most exciting parts of an interest and it becomes more familiar or requires sustained, less-stimulating effort, the dopamine reward diminishes significantly, triggering the crash phase of the hyperfixation-burnout cycle.

**Why This Happens:**

The ADHD brain is a novelty-seeking machine. The dopamine reward system responds strongly to new, surprising, or novel stimuli. Once familiarity sets in:

- The most exciting discoveries have been made
- The surprise and excitement of learning diminish
- Routine aspects of mastery become necessary
- The brain no longer receives the same dopamine "hits"

**The Crash:**

When novelty fades, the neurochemical reward associated with the interest vanishes. The threads of interest that were once vibrant and compelling disappear because the intense motivational drive has evaporated. The person can't "remember" why they were so interested because the dopamine-driven salience is gone.

**Task Completion Paradox:**

Often, the initial exciting challenge is "complete" in the ADHD brain's perception—the basics have been learned, the initial puzzle solved, the core knowledge acquired. The less stimulating, more routine aspects of mastery that follow do not appeal to the dopamine-seeking system, even though objectively there is much more to learn.

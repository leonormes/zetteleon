## A Fair Financial System Uses a Shared Pot and Equal Personal Spending Money

**What:** A practical system for managing finances that maximizes teamwork while protecting individual autonomy.

**How:**
- **1. Agree on Shared Goals:** First, agree on all shared family expenses and savings goals (e.g., mortgage, bills, holidays).
- **2. Create One "Pot":** All or a set percentage of both incomes go into a joint account to cover these shared goals.
- **3. Allocate Personal Spending Money:** From the shared pot, each partner receives a fixed, identical amount transferred to their personal account monthly. This money is theirs to spend with 100% autonomy, no questions asked.

**Failure modes:**
- Not agreeing on what constitutes a "shared" expense.
- The personal spending amount being too low to allow for meaningful autonomy.
- One partner still trying to police the other's personal spending.

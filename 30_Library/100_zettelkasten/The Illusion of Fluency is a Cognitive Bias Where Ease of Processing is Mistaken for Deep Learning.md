## The Illusion of Fluency is a Cognitive Bias Where Ease of Processing is Mistaken for Deep Learning

**Summary:** The "Illusion of Fluency" is a pervasive cognitive bias where learners misinterpret the ease with which they process information (processing fluency) as a reliable indicator of genuine understanding and long-term retention.

**Details:** Because material feels familiar or easy to recall in the present moment, individuals often develop an unwarranted confidence in their knowledge. This leads to metacognitive errors, where they believe they have mastered a topic more thoroughly than they actually have, causing them to cease studying prematurely.

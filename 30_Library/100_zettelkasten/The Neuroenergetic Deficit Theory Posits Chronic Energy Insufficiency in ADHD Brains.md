title: The Neuroenergetic Deficit Theory Posits Chronic Energy Insufficiency in ADHD Brains
type: concept

The neuroenergetic deficit theory of ADHD proposes that individuals with the condition can only access 75-85% of the neurocognitive energy of their neurotypical peers. This is due to catecholamine hypofunctionality leading to decreased neuronal energy through impaired astrocyte glucose and glycogen metabolism.

This chronic insufficiency of neural resources particularly affects task initiation, which requires maximal prefrontal cortex activation, and helps explain why all phases of task execution are impacted.

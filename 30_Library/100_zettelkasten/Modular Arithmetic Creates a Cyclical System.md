title: Modular Arithmetic Creates a Cyclical System

Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value—the modulus. This is often called "clock arithmetic."

In RSA, the modulus $n (p * q)$ creates a finite, cyclical environment for all calculations. This property is what allows the public exponent e and the private exponent d to be perfect inverses of each other.

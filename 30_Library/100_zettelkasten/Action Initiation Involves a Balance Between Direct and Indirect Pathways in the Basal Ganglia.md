## Action Initiation Involves a Balance Between Direct and Indirect Pathways in the Basal Ganglia

**Summary:** The basal ganglia act as the brain's action selection system, where a balance between the "direct pathway" and the "indirect pathway" enables the initiation of desired actions.

**Details:** The direct pathway facilitates the selection of a desired motor program, while the indirect pathway simultaneously suppresses competing, unwanted actions. Rather than a simple "Go/No-Go" system, both pathways are co-activated during action initiation, allowing for precise and appropriate action selection. Disruption in this balance can lead to motor control issues or an inability to initiate action (paralysis).

**Current Understanding:** Contrary to earlier "Go/No-go" models that suggested the pathways work antagonistically, recent evidence shows both are co-activated during action initiation. The current model suggests the direct pathway selects the desired motor program while the indirect pathway inhibits competing ones, with the balance between them enabling appropriate action selection.

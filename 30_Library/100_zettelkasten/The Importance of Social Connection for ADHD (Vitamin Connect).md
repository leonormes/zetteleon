For individuals with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), positive social connection is not merely beneficial but often essential for mental well-being and effective self-management. A lack of positive connection, sometimes referred to as "Vitamin Connect" deficiency, can be psychologically harmful, exacerbating feelings of isolation, misunderstanding, and shame.

Actively cultivating "comfortable, positively connected environments" and practicing the principle of "never worrying alone" can be incredibly healing. This involves:

- **Seeking out supportive communities:** Engaging with groups (online or in-person) where ADHD is understood and accepted, such as support groups.
- **Building strong interpersonal relationships:** Fostering connections with friends, family, or partners who offer empathy and understanding.
- **Open communication:** Sharing challenges and successes with trusted individuals to combat feelings of isolation.

These connections provide external validation, reduce the burden of internal struggles, and offer diverse perspectives, all of which are crucial for navigating the complexities of ADHD in a neurotypical world.

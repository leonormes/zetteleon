title: Mini routines are event-triggered sequences rather than time-based schedules

Mini routines are lightweight behavioral sequences that activate in response to specific events or completed activities, rather than being tied to precise clock times. Instead of scheduling "morning routine at 7:00 AM," an event-triggered routine begins "after breakfast" or "when I finish my first work session."

This event-based approach creates natural flexibility, allowing routines to adapt to variations in daily circumstances while still maintaining structure and consistency. The trigger is a completed action or natural transition point, not an arbitrary time on a clock.

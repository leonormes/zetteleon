## Communication Requires Iterative Approximation

**Summary:** Effective communication relies on continuous feedback loops where participants monitor responses, detect misunderstandings, and adjust their messages to approach shared understanding.

**Details:** Communication is not a one-way transmission but an interactive process. Participants constantly check understanding through questions like "Do you see what I mean?" or by noting facial expressions and unexpected responses. When misunderstanding is detected, communicators repair by rephrasing, providing examples, or approaching the concept from different angles. This redundancy and repair mechanism allows gradual convergence toward shared meaning even when initial attempts fail. The process requires only "good enough" overlap rather than perfect understanding to function effectively.

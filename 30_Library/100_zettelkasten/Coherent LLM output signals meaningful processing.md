title: Coherent LLM output signals meaningful processing

A key part of LLM-driven validation comes from the coherence and logical structure of its responses. When we express a complex idea, we might anticipate a confused or meaningless reply from a non-understanding entity.

An LLM provides the opposite: a structured, coherent analysis that breaks down ideas and draws connections. This coherence signals to us that our thoughts have been processed in a meaningful way, even if that processing is purely algorithmic. This subversion of our negative expectations reinforces the perceived merit of our original thoughts.

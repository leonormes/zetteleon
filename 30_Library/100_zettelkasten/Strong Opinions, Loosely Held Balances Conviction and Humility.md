## 'Strong Opinions, Loosely Held' Balances Conviction and Humility

**Summary:** The mental model of "Strong Opinions, Loosely Held" provides a practical way to act with confidence while remaining open to being wrong.

**Details:** To be effective, one must make decisive choices based on the best available information ("strong opinions"). This allows for confident action. Simultaneously, one must acknowledge their own biases and limitations, remaining ready to update their opinion when new evidence emerges ("loosely held"). This decouples identity from being right, reframing a change of mind as a success of the learning process, not a personal failure.

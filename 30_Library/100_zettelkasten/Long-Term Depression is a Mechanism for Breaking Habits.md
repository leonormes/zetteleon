Long-Term Depression (LTD) is a neuroscientific principle that can be leveraged to break bad habits. It involves weakening neural pathways by intentionally dissociating a trigger from its associated habitual response. This follows the principle that "neurons that stop firing together, stop wiring together." This can be done by inserting a pause or a different action between the trigger and the unwanted habit.

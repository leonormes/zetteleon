## Digital Tools Help Externalize Memory and Structure for ADHD Developers

**Summary:** A variety of digital tools can help software developers with ADHD by externalizing memory, providing structure, and automating routine tasks.

**Details:** These tools can be categorized to address specific needs. Task managers (Trello, Todoist) provide visual organization. AI planners (Saner.AI, Motion) reduce cognitive load by auto-scheduling tasks. Focus apps (Forest, Self Control) combat time blindness and block distractions. Sensory control apps (Brain.fm) and noise-canceling headphones create a conducive environment. Automation tools (TextExpander) save cognitive energy on repetitive tasks, and virtual co-working platforms (Focusmate) provide accountability.

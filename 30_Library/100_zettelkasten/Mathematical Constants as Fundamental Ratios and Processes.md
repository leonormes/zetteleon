Many important numbers are not quantities for counting but are concepts representing fundamental relationships or processes in the universe.

- **Pi ($\pi$)**: Is not just the string of digits $3.14159...$ It *is* the perfect, unchanging **ratio** of any circle's circumference to its diameter. It's a fundamental constant of geometry.
- **Euler's Number ($e$)**: Represents the concept of perfect, **continuous growth**. It is the base rate of change found throughout nature and finance.
- **TREE(3)**: A number so large it cannot be written down. Its existence is defined by a **process** or rule in graph theory. This demonstrates that a number's concept can exist even if its symbolic representation is impossible.

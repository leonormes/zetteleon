## Writing Effective Task Descriptions

- Use action verbs: “Write,” “Call,” “Organise,” “Send.”
- Be specific: “Email Dr Smith about appointment,” not “Email doctor.”
- Avoid ambiguity: Break multi-step tasks into single actions.

## Capturing the “Why”

- At the point of creating a task, write a brief note about its purpose or benefit.
- Connect the task to your values or long-term goals.
- Use WIIFM (“What’s In It For Me?”) to highlight personal benefits.

## Keeping Motivation Alive

- Write a “future self” message: “You’ll feel relieved once this is done!”
- Use motivational cues: Stickers, colours, or emojis in your task list.
- Review your “why” before starting each task.

## Integrating into Task Management Systems

- Digital: Most apps (Todoist, TickTick, Notion) allow notes or comments—use these for your “why” and motivational messages.
- Analogue: Use sticky notes or a dedicated section in your planner for the “why.”

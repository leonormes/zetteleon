Motion provides a sense of accomplishment without requiring the discomfort of genuine action. It allows individuals to feel productive while staying within their comfort zone.

People can get trapped in a cycle of motion, believing they are making progress. For example:

- **"I've got conversations going with four potential clients. This is good."** This is motion. Action would be sending a contract or closing a sale.
- **"I brainstormed some ideas for that book. This is coming together."** This is motion. Action would be writing a chapter.

These activities are not inherently unproductive, but they become a form of procrastination when they consistently substitute for the more difficult, decisive steps required to achieve a goal. The feeling of being busy (motion) is often more comfortable than the feeling of being challenged (action).

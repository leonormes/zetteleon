title: The Target Analogy for Accuracy and Precision

A common and effective analogy to visualize the difference between accuracy and precision is an archer shooting arrows at a target, where the bullseye represents the true value.

- **Accurate & Precise**: All arrows are tightly clustered in the bullseye.
- **Precise but Not Accurate**: All arrows are tightly clustered together, but far from the bullseye.
- **Accurate but Not Precise**: The arrows are scattered, but their average position is the bullseye.
- **Neither Accurate nor Precise**: The arrows are scattered all over the target with no consistency.

This analogy provides a clear visual model for understanding that [[Accuracy and Precision are Independent Concepts]].

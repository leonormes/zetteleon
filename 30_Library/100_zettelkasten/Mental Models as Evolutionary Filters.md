title: Mental Models as Evolutionary Filters

Our brains construct mental models as a highly efficient evolutionary strategy to manage an overwhelming amount of sensory information. These models act as subconscious filters, allowing us to navigate the world, make predictions, and decide on actions without having to consciously process every detail.

From a survival perspective, this is critical. Having pre-built, simplified models allows for the rapid, almost instantaneous decision-making needed to avoid threats and seize opportunities. The trade-off for this speed and efficiency is that we don't experience the model itself; we experience the world *through* the model.

This is analogous to wearing colored lenses from birth; one would not be aware of the lenses, but would simply believe the world is tinted that color. The neural processes that create and use these models are the fundamental architecture of our thought, not an object of our thought. This is a key reason why [[Naïve Realism Makes Mental Models Invisible]].

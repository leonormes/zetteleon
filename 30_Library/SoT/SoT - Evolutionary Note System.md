## Working Knowledge (Stable)

- One Concept, One Source: Each core concept or question has a single "Source of Truth" (SoT) note that acts as its center of gravity.
- Capture to a Queue: New information, thoughts, and LLM responses are added to an "Integration Queue" within the relevant SoT note, not as new, separate notes.
- Synthesize Periodically: Regularly process the Integration Queue to refine the "Current Understanding" section. This act of synthesis builds trust and deepens insight.
- Supersede, Don't Delete: When related notes are converged, the old ones are marked as "superseded" and redirected to the SoT note, preserving their lineage.
- Find via Questions: A central "Questions I Return To" index maps common queries to their corresponding SoT notes, making rediscovery reliable.

## Current Understanding (Evolving)

The fundamental challenge in any long-term intellectual project is "Forgetting the Thread"—the loss of context and momentum when we step away. This is especially critical for neurodivergent minds, where the effort to rebuild a lost line of thought can lead to abandoning projects altogether.

The Evolutionary Note System is a direct solution to this problem. It functions as an externalized line of thought, designed to overcome our natural cognitive limits by treating knowledge as a living process, not a collection of static artifacts.

The core practice is to move from a "capture-first" to a "synthesis-first" mindset. Instead of creating endless, disconnected notes, we first locate the relevant SoT note for a concept. New insights are collected in a low-friction `Integration Queue` within that note. This co-locates related thinking and prepares it for a dedicated `Synthesis Ritual`.

During synthesis, we process the queue, looking for patterns, resolving contradictions, and updating our core understanding. This iterative process is tracked with metadata like `synthesis-count` and `trust-level`, which provides clear signals about the maturity and reliability of the knowledge. This system combats recency bias and the "Collector's Fallacy" by creating evolutionary pressure, ensuring that the best, most durable insights rise to the top, regardless of when they were first captured.

## Integration Queue

## Battle Testing

- Core Claim: A system that prioritizes synthesis over capture and treats notes as evolving documents will build a more trustworthy and useful knowledge base over time, effectively maintaining lines of thought.
- Challenges Survived:
  - (This section is for you to document experiments and tests)
- Current Status: REINFORCED | WEAKENED | UNDER REVIEW
- I don't know how to use it as I go! I think because I used llm to create it it doesn't fit me.

## Understanding Layers

- Layer 1: Basic Mental Model: Stop creating endless new notes to avoid losing the thread. Funnel new thoughts about the same topic into one main note.
- Layer 2: Mechanistic Explanation: Use SoT notes as gravity wells for [[Externalize Memory Aggressively (cognitive offloading)]]. Add raw ideas to an "Integration Queue" and periodically refine them into a "Current Understanding." This separates the act of capture from the act of synthesis.
- Layer 3: Protocol/Detail Level: Implement specific protocols like Resonance Scoring, Battle Testing, and Confidence Gap tracking to create evolutionary pressure and clear trust signals for each piece of knowledge.

## Minimum Viable Understanding (MVU)

- Established: 2025-11-13
- Status: FROZEN (sufficient for current tasks)
- Last Confirmed Working: 2025-11-13
- To start, you only need to:
    1. Create a single SoT note for a recurring question or concept.
    2. Instead of making a new note, add new thoughts to the `Integration Queue` in that SoT note.
    3. Once a week, review the queue and try to summarize the new insights in the `Current Understanding` section.

- Extensions Beyond MVU: Resonance Scoring, Battle Testing, Thinking Trails Index, Formal Synthesis Rituals.

## Tensions and Open Questions

- Capture vs. Synthesis: The system requires delaying the gratification of "capturing" a new idea in favor of the more effortful process of integration and synthesis.
- Structure vs. Fluidity: How to maintain the SoT structure without making the process of thinking feel rigid or bureaucratic?
- Discovery: How to ensure SoT notes are found easily, preventing the accidental creation of duplicates?

## Confidence Gaps

- Discipline for Synthesis: The system's success hinges on the user's discipline to perform regular synthesis rituals. Without this, the Integration Queues could become black holes.
- Index Scalability: The "Questions I Return To" index might become unwieldy over time. It may need its own structure or a better search mechanism.
- Handling Non-textual Ideas: The current model is text-centric. How would it apply to visual thinking (e.g., diagrams, whiteboards) or other media?

-   **The "Meta-Work" Trap:** Organizing becomes a dopamine-rich distraction ("The Alcohol") that replaces actual work.
-   **Cognitive Overload from Dependencies:** Every tool, plugin, or complex workflow adds a "maintenance tax." The mental energy spent managing the *system* (dependencies) subtracts from the energy available for the *task*.
-   **The Cost:** The mental model of a complex system is forgotten upon re-entry, leading to "bankruptcy" (declaring the system failed and starting over).

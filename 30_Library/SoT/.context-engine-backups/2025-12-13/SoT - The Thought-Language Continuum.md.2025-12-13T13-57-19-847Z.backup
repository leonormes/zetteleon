### A. Pre-Linguistic Thought (The Iceberg)

Cognition that exists independently of words. This constitutes the vast majority of mental life.

-   **Mental Imagery:** Visualizing a scene without describing it.
-   **Somatic Markers:** Emotional/gut feelings that guide decision-making before verbal reasoning.
-   **Unsymbolised Thinking:** The "flash of insight" or formulation of an idea before language centers engage.
-   **Evidence from Aphasia:** Individuals with global aphasia (loss of language) often retain the capacity for complex, strategic, and mathematical thought, proving that intelligence is not dependent on linguistic proficiency.
-   **Neural Patterns:** Ideas exist as distributed patterns of neural activation. Language is merely the "lossy compression" code used to transmit these patterns.

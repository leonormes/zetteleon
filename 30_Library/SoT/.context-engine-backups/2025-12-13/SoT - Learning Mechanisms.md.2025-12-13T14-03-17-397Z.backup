## 2. The Core Mechanism: The Explorer's High & The Social Reward System

### The "Mystery" as Dopamine

The brain is an explorer. When it spots a "Mysterious Island" (a new concept, tool, or hobby), it releases dopamine in anticipation. This is **Salience**.

-   **Function:** This surge aligns the **Task-Positive Network (TPN)**, creating hyperfocus.
-   **The Trigger:** It is the *gap* between what you know and what you see that generates the energy.

### The "Mastery" Crash

As you learn, you map the island. The "Magic" of the new concept dissolves into "Mechanics."

-   *Example:* "Linux Namespaces" seem magical (How can they isolate?) -> You learn the mechanism (It's just bit-masking) -> The magic dies.
-   **Result:** The Prediction Error hits zero. The dopamine faucet turns off. The ADHD brain, now under-stimulated, disengages or feels "bored" (which is actually a low-dopamine distress state).

### The "Giving" Reward (Dopamine from Altruism)
The brain's reward system extends beyond self-interest. Studies show:
-   **Cooperation is Rewarding:** Mutual cooperation activates reward centers (ventral striatum) even when personal financial gain is less, indicating a preference for collective welfare.
-   **Altruism Feels Good:** Choosing to give money to charity or family members (costly donations) results in *greater* activity in reward regions than receiving money yourself. Our reward system is sensitive to the welfare of others, suggesting giving is inherently pleasurable.

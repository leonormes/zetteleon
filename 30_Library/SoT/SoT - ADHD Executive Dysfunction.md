## 2. The Core Deficits

ADHD impacts the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), specifically the networks responsible for "Top-Down" control.

1.  **Inhibition (The Brake):** The inability to stop an automatic response (impulse) or filter out sensory noise (distraction). This is exacerbated by dysregulation of the TPN/DMN switch.
2.  **Planning & Prioritization:** An impaired ability to break down large goals into sequential steps, discern the relative importance of tasks, and manage dependencies.
3.  **Working Memory (The RAM):** A smaller cognitive workspace, leading to "leaky" thoughts and difficulty holding a goal in mind while executing it. This can make the DMN intrusive, overwhelming the TPN.
4.  **Metacognition (Self-Awareness & Motivation):** Deficits in "thinking about thinking" impact self-awareness of motivation, strategy identification, and self-assessment. This makes it difficult to understand true drivers of motivation or assess one's own performance.
5.  **Time Blindness:** The inability to "feel" the passage of time or predict how long a task will take. The ADHD brain lives in two times: "Now" and "Not Now." (See: [[SoT - The Nature of Time and Perception]]).

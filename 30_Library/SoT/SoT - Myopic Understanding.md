### The Purpose of Understanding

Evolutionarily, the brain is a [[The Brain as a Distributed Prediction Machine|prediction machine]].

-   **Prediction:** The goal of "understanding" is to minimize [[Prediction Error Drives Dopamine Release|prediction error]].
-   **Causality:** A wider view (higher abstraction) allows us to see longer chains of cause-and-effect ("If I do X, Y will happen").
-   **Deep Understanding:** Beyond simple prediction, deep understanding reveals the *mechanism* of causality. This insight into *how* elements interact is crucial for systemic comprehension and effective problem-solving (intervention), rather than just passive forecasting.
-   **Myopia's Cost:** When our view is too narrow (myopic), we fail to predict second-order consequences, leading to errors in judgment.

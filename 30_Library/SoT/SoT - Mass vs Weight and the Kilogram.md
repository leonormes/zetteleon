## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Mass vs. Weight
> **Mass** is a scalar quantity measuring the amount of matter in an object; it is intrinsic and constant regardless of location.
>
> **Weight** is a vector quantity measuring the force of gravity acting on that mass ($W = m \times g$); it is extrinsic and varies with the gravitational field strength.

## 2. The Core Distinction

| Property | Mass | Weight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Amount of matter / Inertia | Force of gravity on mass |
| **Type** | Scalar (Magnitude only) | Vector (Magnitude + Direction) |
| **SI Unit** | Kilogram (**kg**) | Newton (**N**) |
| **Constancy** | **Constant** everywhere in the universe. | **Variable** (Depends on gravity $g$). |
| **Formula** | $m = F/a$ | $W = m \times g$ |

### Practical Confusion (The Gym Context)

Why do we "lift weights" in kilograms?

-   On Earth's surface, gravity ($g$) is roughly constant (~9.81 m/s²).
-   Therefore, Mass is a reliable proxy for Weight. An object with 20kg mass always exerts ~196N of force downwards.
-   It is a linguistic shorthand, not a scientific accuracy. We say "it weighs 20kg," but physically we mean "it has a mass of 20kg, resulting in a weight of 196N."

## 3. The Definition of the Kilogram

Since 2019, the kilogram is no longer defined by a physical object (the "Grand K" artifact). It is defined by a fundamental constant of nature to ensure universality and stability.

> [!info] The 2019 Definition
> The kilogram is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the **Planck constant ($h$)** to be $6.62607015 \times 10^{-34}$ J⋅s.

### Why the Change
-   **Stability:** Physical artifacts (like the platinum-iridium cylinder) can lose atoms or degrade over time. Constants of nature do not.
-   **Universality:** This definition allows any laboratory in the universe with sufficient equipment (like a Kibble Balance) to realize the kilogram without comparing it to a piece of metal in Paris.
-   **Interconnectedness:** The definition depends on the definitions of the *second* (time) and the *meter* (length), reflecting the unified nature of physical laws.

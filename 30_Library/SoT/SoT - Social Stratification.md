## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Definition
> **Social Stratification** is the hierarchical arrangement of social categories that evolve into stable structures of inequality. It is an **institutionalised system** ("the architecture"), distinct from individual differences ("runtime data"). It ensures that categories of people (defined by class, status, or power) have unequal access to resources, regardless of individual capability.

## 2. The Three Dimensions (Weber's Triad)

Unlike Marx's purely economic view, Max Weber argued stratification occurs across three distinct but overlapping layers:

| Dimension | Domain | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Class** | Economic Order | Market position and control over resources (wealth, income). | Factory Owner vs. Worker |
| **Status** | Social Order | Prestige, honour, and social closure ("Access Rights"). | Priest (High Status, Low Class) |
| **Power/Party** | Political Order | The ability to enforce one's will against resistance. | Politician, Bureaucrat |

## 3. Origins: Evolutionary vs. Structural

Is stratification natural?

-   **Hunter-Gatherer Baseline:** For 95% of human history, society was aggressively egalitarian with active "levelling mechanisms" to suppress dominance. Status existed but was not heritable.
-   **The Shift (Agriculture):** Stratification is a function of **Scalability** and **Surplus**.
    -   *Surplus:* Storable calories (grain) allowed hoarding and theft.
    -   *Complexity:* Irrigation/Defense required central administration (The State).
-   **Conclusion:** Status-seeking is biological (firmware); Systemic Stratification is technological/structural (hardware scale).

## 4. Major Theoretical Perspectives

### A. Functionalism (Optimisation)
-   **Thesis:** Stratification is a feature, necessary for efficiency.
-   **Logic:** High rewards motivate talented individuals to fill critical, difficult roles (e.g., surgeons).
-   **Critique:** Ignores non-meritocratic wealth (inheritance) and undervalues essential roles (nursing).

### B. Conflict Theory (Exploitation)
-   **Thesis:** Stratification is the result of struggle over resources; stability is maintained by dominance.
-   **Logic (Marx):** Bourgeoisie (owners) extract surplus value from Proletariat (workers).
-   **Critique:** Economically reductionist; struggles with race/gender.

### C. Bourdieu (Capital & Reproduction)
-   **Thesis:** Inequality is reproduced through the conversion of capital types.
-   **Forms of Capital:**
    -   *Economic:* Money.
    -   *Social:* Networks.
    -   *Cultural:* Knowledge, taste, mannerisms (Habitus).
-   **Mechanism:** Elites reproduce their status by defining "good taste" and "competence" in ways that exclude others.

## 5. Mechanisms of Persistence

How does the system maintain stability?

1.  **Institutions (The OS):** Laws (zoning, inheritance) that validate specific users.
2.  **Path Dependence:** "Technical debt" from past architecture (e.g., redlining) persists even after laws change.
3.  **Ideology (Documentation):** Beliefs (e.g., "The poor are lazy") that justify the structural imbalance.

### Examples
-   **Class:** Opportunity Hoarding via Zoning Laws (exclusionary housing).
-   **Race:** Asset Accumulation. Wealth gaps are driven by historical compounding (inheritance), not just current income.
-   **Gender:** The "Second Shift" of unpaid reproductive labour restricts capital accumulation.

## 6. Normative & Policy Implications

-   **Contingency:** The level of inequality is a **political choice**. (Comparison: Sweden vs. USA).
-   **Distributive Justice (Rawls):** A system is just only if you would enter it behind a "Veil of Ignorance" (not knowing your station).
-   **Inequality harms everyone:** High inequality correlates with lower trust, higher crime, and worse health outcomes for *all* classes.

## 8. Case Study: The Contemporary UK Class System

The UK provides a distinct example of how stratification evolves. It is currently best understood as a **Hybrid Model** combining traditional occupation (NS-SEC) with a multi-dimensional capital approach (GBCS).

### The Great British Class Survey (GBCS) Model
Moving beyond the "Working/Middle/Upper" triad, this model identifies 7 classes based on Economic, Social, and Cultural capital:

1.  **Elite:** High capital across all three dimensions.
2.  **Established Middle Class:** Wealthy, socially connected, culturally active.
3.  **Technical Middle Class:** Prosperous but socially/culturally isolated.
4.  **New Affluent Workers:** Young, socially active, moderate income.
5.  **Traditional Working Class:** Low capital, but often homeowners (asset-rich, cash-poor).
6.  **Emergent Service Workers:** Young, urban, low income but high cultural capital.
7.  **Precariat:** The most deprived, lacking security in all dimensions.

### The Symbolic Apex
-   **The Monarchy:** Exists outside standard economic classification. It functions as a source of **Social Honour** and institutional continuity, representing the peak of the "Status" dimension (Weber) independent of pure market forces.

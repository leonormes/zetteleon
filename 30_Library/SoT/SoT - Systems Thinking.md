## Working Knowledge (Stable)

-   **The Trinity of Systems:** A system consists of three things: **Elements** (the parts), **Interconnections** (the relationships/flows), and a **Function/Purpose** (the goal).
-   **Purpose is King:** The least obvious part—the *purpose*—is the most critical determinant of behavior. Purpose is deduced from what the system *actually does* (behavior), not what it *says* it does (rhetoric).
-   **Feedback Loops:**
    -   **Balancing Loops (B):** Stability-seeking mechanisms that try to keep a stock at a set level (e.g., thermostat, homeostasis).
    -   **Reinforcing Loops (R):** Amplifying mechanisms that lead to exponential growth or collapse (e.g., compound interest, "the rich get richer").
-   **Delays:** Time lags between action and feedback are the primary source of system oscillation and policy failure. By the time a problem is obvious, the correction may be too late.
-   **Bounded Rationality:** Rational decisions made by actors within a local part of the system often produce irrational or disastrous results for the system as a whole.

## Current Understanding (Evolving)

Systems Thinking is the necessary counter-balance to the West's dominant philosophy of Reductionism. While Reductionism solves problems by breaking them into static parts, Systems Thinking solves problems by analyzing dynamic webs of cause and effect.

The central insight is that **Structure Determinates Behavior**. Persistent problems (like poverty, addiction, or technical debt) are rarely caused by "bad actors" or "bad luck," but are intrinsic properties of the system's design. "Quick fixes" usually address symptoms and trigger **Compensating Feedback**, where the system pushes back to restore the old equilibrium (Fixes That Backfire).

True leverage comes not from pushing harder on the existing loops, but from:

1.  **Shortening delays** in feedback.
2.  **Changing the rules** (interconnections).
3.  **Changing the goal** (purpose) of the system.

## Minimum Viable Understanding (MVU)

-   **Don't Blame the Person, Look at the Loop:** If a pattern persists despite changing the people involved, the problem is structural.
-   **The Iceberg Model:**
    -   *Events* (What just happened?) <- React
    -   *Patterns* (What has been happening?) <- Anticipate
    -   *Structure* (What interactions cause these patterns?) <- **Design** (Leverage Point)
    -   *Mental Models* (What beliefs uphold this structure?) <- Transform
-   **The Core Heuristic:** When analyzing a situation, ask: "Is this a Balancing Loop (trying to stay the same) or a Reinforcing Loop (trying to run away)?"

## Tensions and Gaps

-   **Efficiency vs. Resilience:** Diverse, redundant systems are stable but "inefficient." Streamlined, optimized systems are efficient but brittle (no buffer).
-   **The Visibility Problem:** Interconnections (flows of information) and Purposes are invisible, making them harder to "see" and manipulate than physical Elements.

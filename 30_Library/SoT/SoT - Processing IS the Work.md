## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Definition
> **Processing IS the Work.** It is not administrative overhead or "prep" before the real work begins.
>
> Processing is the **creative act** of converting raw inputs into structured knowledge, insights, and actions. It is where meaning is made.

## 2. The Core Conflict (ADHD Resistance)

ADHD brains resist "Review" and "Processing" because they categorize it as **Meta-Work**: boring, high-effort, low-dopamine administration. This leads to:

-   **The Wall of Awful:** A backlog of unread notes that induces shame.
-   **The Search for Perfection:** Trying to build a "perfect system" instead of moving items forward.
-   **Data Decay:** Information rotting in the inbox because the cognitive cost of filing is too high.

## 3. Key Principles & Mindset Shifts

### A. Reframe Processing as Creation
-   **Old View:** "I have to tidy up my notes." (Chore)
-   **New View:** "I am building my knowledge architecture." (Creation)
-   Every minute spent processing yields a tangible asset: a new connection, a clarified plan, or a synthesized concept.

### B. Embrace "Good Enough" (The 1% Move)
-   **The Rule:** A note that gets a single tag or one connecting thought is better than 50 notes waiting for "proper" processing.
-   **The Shift:** Stop trying to complete the whole task. Just move it **one step forward**.

### C. Work with Momentum (Interest over System)
-   **The Rule:** Process what pulls you. The system should flex around your attention, not vice versa.
-   **The Strategy:** If a note is boring, skip it. If it sparks curiosity, dive in. Use **interest** as the fuel for processing.

## 4. Actionable Strategies (The "How")

These strategies bypass executive dysfunction by lowering the barrier to entry.

### Strategy 1: The "Two-Minute Rule" for Capture
-   **Trigger:** When you see a raw note.
-   **Question:** "Can I do *anything* with this in 2 minutes?" (Tag it, link it, archive it).
-   **Action:** Do it now. If not, move to "Later Soup" and ignore.

### Strategy 2: The "One Question Game"
-   **Trigger:** Processing a backlog.
-   **Question:** "What is the *smallest interesting thing* I could do with this right now?"
-   **Goal:** Engagement, not utility. Add a funny tag, a random link, or a reaction.

### Strategy 3: Contextual Cues (Piggybacking)
-   **Trigger:** Waiting for a meeting, coffee, or bus.
-   **Action:** Process *one* item. Don't schedule "Review Time"; snatch "Review Moments."

### Strategy 4: The "Traffic Light" Triage
-   **Method:** Scan list rapidly.
-   **🔴 Red:** Delete/Archive. (Data Decay is acceptable).
-   **🟡 Amber:** Incubate/Someday.
-   **🟢 Green:** Active/Next Action.

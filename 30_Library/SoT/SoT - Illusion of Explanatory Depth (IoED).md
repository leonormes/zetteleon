## 2. The Core Mechanism: Heuristic Substitution

The brain creates this illusion to conserve metabolic energy. When confronted with a complex system (e.g., "The Economy," "Kubernetes," "A Toilet"), it performs a rapid heuristic check:

1.  **The Query:** "Do I understand X?"
2.  **The Substitution:** Instead of auditing the causal logic, the brain substitutes an easier question: *"Do I recognise X? Do I know what X is for?"*
3.  **The False Positive:** Because the label is familiar ("That is a toilet, it flushes"), the brain tags the system as "Known" and suppresses further enquiry.

This creates **Causal Opacity**: a "black box" in the mental model that is labelled as transparent. The gap remains invisible until the individual is forced to *simulate* the mechanism (explain or build it).

> **Crucial Distinction:** True understanding surpasses mere **prediction** (knowing *that* X happens). It requires **causal insight** (knowing *why* X happens). This ability to trace the chain of cause-and-effect is the prerequisite for effective problem-solving and systemic comprehension. Without it, we are merely observing correlations.

### The ADHD Multiplier

For the neurodivergent brain, IoED is exacerbated by **Metacognitive Deficits**. The dopamine reward often comes from *finding* the information (collection/recognition), which the brain prematurely closes as a "Learning Loop," even though no deep encoding or structural understanding has occurred.

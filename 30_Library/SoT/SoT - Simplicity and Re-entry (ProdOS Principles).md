### A. Radical Simplicity ("Don't Make Me Think")
-   **Minimal Components:** Few moving parts. One inbox, one active list, one archive.
-   **Minimal Dependencies:** Rely on **Fundamentals** (Plain Text, Standard Libraries) over complex plugins or fragile integrations. "Is this essential, or just cool?"
-   **Intuitive Workflow:** Capture and retrieval must be obvious. No complex decision trees for "where does this go?"
-   **Low Activation Energy:** The effort to *start* must be practically zero.

## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Effortless Engagement
> ProdOS prioritizes **radical simplicity** and **frictionless re-entry**. The system must require **minimal cognitive load** for maintenance and operation, ensuring it remains usable even during periods of low executive function.
>
> **The Rule:** "If you have to think about *how* to use the system, the friction is too high."

## 2. The Problem: Over-Complication as Procrastination

Traditional productivity systems often fail individuals with ADHD because they demand consistent, high-effort maintenance (meticulous tagging, daily reviews). When the initial "enthusiasm burst" wanes, the structure crumbles.

-   **The "Meta-Work" Trap:** Organizing becomes a dopamine-rich distraction ("The Alcohol") that replaces actual work.
-   **The Cost:** The mental model of a complex system is forgotten upon re-entry, leading to "bankruptcy" (declaring the system failed and starting over).

---

## 3. The "Effortless Engagement" Protocol

To survive the natural ebbs and flows of motivation, the system adheres to three core principles:

### A. Radical Simplicity ("Don't Make Me Think")
-   **Minimal Components:** Few moving parts. One inbox, one active list, one archive.
-   **Intuitive Workflow:** Capture and retrieval must be obvious. No complex decision trees for "where does this go?"
-   **Low Activation Energy:** The effort to *start* must be practically zero.

### B. Leveraging ADHD Traits
-   **Capture-Focused:** The primary function is to catch the "flood of ideas" without friction.
-   **Search Over Structure:** We rely on powerful **Semantic Search** (`Dataview`, `Smart Connections`) rather than perfect manual filing.
    -   *Strategy:* Capture the idea with a few unique keywords/tags and trust the search engine to find it later.
-   **"Out of Sight, Still Functional":** The system must not break if neglected for a week.

### C. Externalized Mental Models

We do not rely on working memory to maintain system state.

-   **The "Session Note" Protocol:** Leave a "breadcrumb trail" at the end of a session (`Now`, `Next`, `Why`) so you can resume without re-deriving context.
-   **External Reminders:** Use "dumb" tools (alarms, simple lists) to prompt engagement, rather than expecting the system to "pull" you in.

## 4. Operational Protocols

### 1. The Frictionless Capture
-   **Tool:** `00_Inbox` / Daily Note.
-   **Action:** Dump raw text. Do not format. Do not organize.
-   **Why:** Capture is for *Retention*; Processing is for *Thinking*. Do not mix them.

### 2. The "No-Filing" Rule
-   **Rule:** We rarely move files to deep folders.
-   **Action:** Notes stay in `20_Thinking` (Flat list) or move to `30_Library` (SoT).
-   **Why:** "Filing" is a decision point that taxes executive function.

### 3. Iterate over Perfect
-   **Mindset:** A messy system that is *used* is infinitely better than a perfect system that is *abandoned*.
-   **Action:** "Improve 1%" per session.

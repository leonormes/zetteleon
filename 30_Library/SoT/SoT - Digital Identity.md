## 2. Core Components of a Digital Identity

A digital identity is best understood through its fundamental data components:

### A. Identifiers

Unique labels used to refer to a specific identity within a system. An identifier acts as a primary key or pointer to the collection of attributes.

- **Purpose:** To uniquely name an entity within a given context.
- **Examples:** Username, email address, UUID, passport number (digitized). A single person has multiple identifiers across various systems.

### B. Attributes

Individual pieces of data or claims made about the subject of the identity. These are key-value pairs that describe what the entity *is* or *has*.

- **Purpose:** To describe characteristics of the entity.
- **Types:**
  - **Self-asserted:** Claimed by the entity itself (e.g., "My name is John").
  - **Verified:** Attested by a trusted authority (e.g., government digitally confirms date of birth).
- **Examples:** `given_name: "John"`, `date_of_birth: "1990-10-26"`, `is_over_18: true`, `role: "administrator"`.

### C. Credentials

Tamper-evident, machine-readable data structures that cryptographically bind attributes to an identifier. They are issued by an authority and presented to a relying party to prove claims.

- **Purpose:** To verifiably prove specific attributes without necessarily revealing all other attributes.
- **Examples:** Digital equivalent of a driver's license (proves "over 18" without revealing exact DOB). Can be passwords, digital certificates, OAuth tokens.

## 3. Purpose of Digital Identity (Abstract View)

From an abstract viewpoint, the fundamental purpose of a digital identity is to **establish sufficient trust to enable interactions in a digital environment**. It achieves this by performing three core functions:

### A. Authentication

To answer the question, "*Are you who you claim to be?*".

- **Mechanism:** Verifying a claimed identity (e.g., password, fingerprint, digital certificate).
- **Outcome:** Proving to the system that the entity is the legitimate operator of that digital identity.

### B. Authorization

To answer the question, "*Are you allowed to do that?*".

- **Mechanism:** Determining what actions an authenticated entity is permitted to perform based on its attributes (e.g., `role: "manager"`, `clearance_level: "secret"`).
- **Outcome:** Granting or denying access to resources, data, or functionalities.

### C. Attribution & Accountability

To reliably link digital actions to a specific identity, and by extension, to the person or system it represents.

- **Mechanism:** Creating a verifiable record of who did what and when.
- **Outcome:** Enabling legal and commercial trust, non-repudiation (inability to deny an action), and accountability.

## 4. Identity Claims: Human vs. Machine

While the abstract properties are shared, the *nature* of the claims (attributes) and the *authority* that verifies them differ significantly.

### A. 🧑 Human Digital Identity

Designed to represent a natural person; its claims are tied to legal and social existence.

- **Core Claims (Who you are):**
  - **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Legal name, date of birth, government ID numbers (e.g., passport). Verified by government authorities.
  - **Biometrics:** Fingerprints, facial scans, voice patterns (link digital identity to unique physical person).
  - **Contact Information:** Email, phone, physical address.
- **Entitlement & Status Claims (What you are allowed):**
  - **Qualifications:** University degrees, professional certifications.
  - **Status:** "Over 18", "UK Resident", "Employee", "Platinum Member".
- **Behavioural Claims (How you act):**
  - **History:** Purchase history, browsing activity.
  - **Reputation:** Credit score, online reviews.

### B. ⚙️ Machine/Application/Process Digital Identity

Designed to represent a non-person entity (NPE) like software, server, IoT device, or microservice. Claims relate to its function, origin, and operational context.

- **Core Claims (What it is):**
  - **Unique Identifiers:** UUID, MAC address, service name, process ID (PID), cryptographic key pair.
  - **Origin & Integrity:** Software vendor, code signature, version number, hash of the binary (proves no tampering).
  - **Configuration:** IP address, operating system, location (e.g., `aws:region:eu-west-2`), hardware specifications.
- **Entitlement & Status Claims (What it is allowed):**
  - **Roles & Permissions:** "Database Reader", "Queue Writer", "Metrics Publisher" (defined within IAM).
  - **Security Posture:** Security patch level, last vulnerability scan date, compliance status (e.g., "PCI-DSS Compliant").
- **Behavioural Claims (How it acts):**
  - **Operational Telemetry:** CPU usage patterns, network traffic flows, API call logs.
  - **Reputation:** Known good or malicious process, IP address reputation.

## 5. Relationship to a Person & Levels of Assurance

A digital identity is a **proxy** of a natural person. The link between the data (digital identity) and the person (subject) is through **identity proofing** or **binding**.

- **Binding:** The act of linking the digital representation to the physical person with a certain confidence level (e.g., scanning a passport and taking a selfie for a bank account).
- **Levels of Assurance (LoA):** The strength of this binding.
  - **Low LoA:** Email and self-asserted name (e.g., social media). Weak link.
  - **High LoA:** Rigorous proofing against authoritative sources (government IDs, biometrics). Strong, reliable link.

A single person can have multiple digital identities, each for a different context (professional, social, citizen).

## 6. Minimum Viable Understanding (MVU)

1. **Digital Identity = Data:** It's a collection of identifiers, attributes, and verifiable credentials.
2. **Purpose = Trust:** It enables authentication ("who are you?"), authorization ("what can you do?"), and accountability ("who did it?").
3. **Human ≠ Machine:** Claims differ significantly (personal/legal vs. operational/functional).
4. **Identity is a Proxy:** It's a digital representation, bound to a person with varying Levels of Assurance.

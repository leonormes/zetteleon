## 1. PKM, Metacognition & The Craft of Thinking

A central theme is the ongoing struggle with the *process* of knowledge management versus the desired *outcome* of better thinking. This includes reflections on the thinking process itself, the pull towards new tools, and the frequent return to simplicity ([[Back to Simpler Ways]]).

- **Core Challenges**:
  - The meta-work of PKM becomes a form of procrastination.
  - The "Illusion of Profundity": ideas feel powerful in the head but are difficult to articulate.
  - Over-collection of information vs. the harder work of synthesis and writing.
  - Defining the [[Purpose of my PKM system]]: Is it for learning, work, or personal insight?
- **Key Concepts Explored**:
  - [[Maintaining Lines of Thought Over Time]]
  - The search for an "effortless" or ADHD-friendly system.
  - The role of LLMs as a [[My Vision of a Thought Partner]].

## 2. ADHD, Psychology & Personal Growth

This is the most significant category, exploring the emotional and practical impact of living with ADHD and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD). The notes document a journey of self-discovery, shame, and the search for self-acceptance.

- **Core Challenges**:
  - The cycle of procrastination, shame, and fear of failure ([[Procrastination Triggers]]).
  - The intense need for external validation and the fragility of self-belief when faced with criticism.
  - A complex relationship with authority, disliking both receiving and wielding it.
  - Emotional dysregulation, where enthusiasm is fickle and cannot be relied upon for motivation.
  - [[I have a lot of shame about my life]], often linked to perceived incompetence or not meeting self-imposed standards.
- **Key Concepts Explored**:
  - [[I have only recently started to come to terms emotionally with ADHD]].
  - [[Why External Validation is So Powerful]].
  - The impact of medication (Mounjaro) on physical health, self-image, and "food noise."
  - The desire for discipline and the ability to stick to plans.

## 3. Work, Engineering & Productivity

These notes capture the day-to-day technical challenges, project management thoughts, and the persistent desire for better productivity systems (GTD, timeboxing) to overcome procrastination.

- **Primary Technical Areas**:
  - **Kubernetes**: Learning the API, objects (StorageClass, PVCs), networking (Calico, CNI), and Helm chart complexity.
  - **Cloud & Networking**: AWS/Azure private networking, DNS, firewalls, and Terraform configuration.
  - **Security**: [[My Cryptography Research]], PKI, HCP Vault, certificates, and JWTs.
  - **Project FITFILE**: Defining core components, features, and managing deployments (SDE/CUH).
- **Work-Related Themes**:
  - The difficulty of managing complex, distributed systems.
  - The need for better documentation and a shared understanding within the team.
  - Frustration with project planning, unclear requirements, and team communication.

## 4. Learning, Philosophy & The Nature of Understanding

This theme focuses on the metacognitive act of learning itself—how you think, why you learn, and the nature of understanding, often using analogies and philosophical reasoning.

- **Core Questions**:
  - What does it mean to truly "learn" something versus just feeling novelty?
  - How to move from memorization to deep understanding.
  - The nature of intelligence, consciousness, and the role of language in thought.
  - The joy of "shifts in perspective" and deconstructing ideas to find foundational assumptions.
- **Key Concepts Explored**:
  - [[Novelty Seeking]] as a driver for learning.
  - The challenge of [[Overwhelm]] when faced with vast amounts of information.
  - **Data & Emergent Properties**: Interest in how complex systems behave, like how anonymized data can combine to reveal identities.
  - **Communication & Analogy**: Using metaphors to explore problems and clarify mismatched expectations.

## 5. Family & Relationships

These entries touch upon personal relationships, particularly the challenges and joys of family life.

- **Primary Focus**:
  - **Educating Bessie**: Trying to understand her learning style, motivations, and the "I can't do it" reflex. There's a desire to make learning engaging and effective for her.
  - **Relationship Dynamics**: Reflections on communication, needs, and understanding with your partner, Zofja.
  - **Parental Concerns**: Worrying about Bessie's emotional well-being and behavior at school.

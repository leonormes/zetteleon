## Summary

**The Core Problem:**
You can't trust your notes to represent your current thinking. Even when you find relevant past notes, you don't know if they're still valid or have been superseded by later evolution. This makes them functionally useless—so you either ignore them and duplicate work, or second-guess them and can't build confidently.

**The Thought Process:**

1. **Started with the symptom:** Compulsive system-building that feels ritualistic and disconnected from actual outcomes
2. **Identified the behavior:** Cargo culting PKM—building infrastructure for emergence and insight that never actually happens, just accumulating content while endlessly redesigning systems
3. **Found the surface problem:** Writing the same insights repeatedly because you can't *find* what you've already written when you need it—your past thinking doesn't surface at the point of relevance
4. **Reached the root cause:** Even when you *do* find notes, you can't trust they represent your *latest* thinking. Ideas evolve, but notes are frozen snapshots from unknown points in time with no version control

**What You Actually Need:**
Not better capture. Not better search. But a way to know **"What do I currently think about X after all iterations?"**—version control for evolving understanding, not just a flat archive of historical snapshots.

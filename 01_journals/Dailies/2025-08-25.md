- I am trying to create a pkm system but like a mathematical one. I want this zettelkasten to be a certain way but don't have a clear definition, and so I am going by feeling. This doesn't work. I want it to help remove uncertainty in my thinking. I want to be able to extend my ideas and keep uncovering assumptions. But have a record of that process so that I can come back to it and recover my thinking. Currently, this does not work.
- I have to slow down and allow thoughts time to grow

- What I want to do with the unified deployment IaC is refine it and remove the extra stuff that is there. I do not like it that when we rerun the IaC, there are errors. These are defects in our code. Investigate what we can do with the GitLab and TFC workspaces.
- How do we auth against GitLab for terraform cloud to make changes?

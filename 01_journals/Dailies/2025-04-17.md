I have a feeling of why I want to read a book. For instance, Casad, *TCP/IP in 24 Hours, Sams Teach Yourself*.

I am attracted to the potentiel knowledge in it. But what do I want from it? I am stuck on the OSI model. It is like I am trying to remember it all. I just need to understand what the model is for. I don't need to be able to recall all the layers. I am interested in the data structure of network traffic.

But when I think, I want to learn networking, what do I mean? What could 'learn networking' mean?

- Being able to solve problems in a real network.
- Understanding what the components of a host to host network do.
- Understanding the trade offs when designing a network solution.
- Understanding the fundamentals of networking to help with solving problems.
  I made a start before where I was creating netns on linux machines. I was building a container using linux namespaces.
  I then started with the whole networking thing.
  I am again coming back to the question why? The info and facts are legion. Do I need/want to remember them? When I read the part about the layers, am I trying to memorise all the info?

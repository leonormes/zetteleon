To help identify where Bessie's IEP (Individualized Education Program) is not being implemented, she could answer a set of evaluation questions after each lesson. These questions are drawn from her latest Learning Profile [1-4], previous recommendations [5-12], and her recent interview [13-27], which highlights areas where support is inconsistently applied.

Here is a set of evaluation questions for Bessie to consider after each lesson:

**Evaluation Questions for Bessie: Checking IEP Implementation Per Lesson**

**I. General Understanding and Communication of Support**

1. Did your teacher in this lesson seem to know about your support plan (IEP/ISP)? [16, 28]
2. Did your teacher in this lesson use strategies that help you learn best, without you having to ask for them? [28]

**II. Specific Classroom Support Implementation**

- **Processing Information & Task Management:**
  1. When your teacher gave instructions or new information today, did they give you extra time to process it? [1, 17, 28]
  2. Were any large tasks or assignments broken down into smaller, achievable chunks for you in this lesson? [1, 17, 28]
  3. Did your teacher provide visual reminders or verbal cues to help you remember strategies to use when you were working? [1, 22, 29]
  4. Did your teacher prompt you to stay focused and on task if you got distracted during this lesson? [2, 29]
  5. When copying notes from the board, did your teacher provide keywords or the long date already written down, or printed materials to make it easier for you? [2, 18, 29]
  6. Before you started a task, did your teacher check to make sure you fully understood what you needed to do? [11, 29]
  7. Did you get a simple task to do by yourself that was then checked by the teacher, to help you feel successful and confident? [2, 11, 30]

- **Academic Tool & Material Use:**
  1. Were you able to easily use your school laptop for longer writing tasks or tests in this lesson, if needed? Did you have to ask a lot? [2, 19, 30, 31]
  2. Were your resources or books for this lesson printed on blue paper, or did you use a blue paper book? [2, 20, 30, 31]
  3. Did your teacher remind you to use "look, cover, write, check" strategies if you were learning new spellings or facts? [12, 32]
  4. Did your teacher help you when you were struggling with spelling or if you forgot something you just learned? How did they help? [20, 21]

- **Reading and Math Support (as applicable to the lesson):**
  1. Did you get opportunities to read in school today, and was any of it paired reading with an adult or peer? Did that help take the pressure off you? [6, 11, 32]
  2. If this was a math lesson, did your teacher help you practice multiplication and division with powers of 10, especially those with decimals? What about your 2, 3, 5, and 10 times tables? [1, 32, 33]
  3. Did you have a chance to develop answers with alternative interpretations or read out loud in a comfortable way? [1, 34]

**III. Emotional and Sensory Management Support**

1. When you felt worried or overwhelmed in this lesson, how did your teacher support you? [2, 23, 35]
2. If the classroom felt noisy or busy, were you able to use your time-out pass to go to a quieter room or the sensory room's cubby? Was it easily available? [25, 31, 36]
3. Did your teacher allow you thinking time before answering questions, or offer you a chance to prepare answers with a peer or adult if that helps? [7, 35]
4. Did your teacher help you learn or practice calming strategies (like breathing techniques) if you felt anxious? [6, 35]
5. If you were stuck or confused, did you feel comfortable asking your teacher for help? What happened when you did? [25, 37]
6. Did your teacher seem to understand what you needed when you were feeling anxious, rather than just telling you to behave a certain way? [26]

**IV. Progress and Feedback**

1. Did your teacher praise your effort and the strategies you used in this lesson, not just if you got things "right"? [9, 22, 37]
2. Did your teacher encourage you to try "stretch and challenge" tasks today? How did they make you feel about pushing your boundaries? [1, 34, 38]
3. Were you able to identify where you had been successful using a "green comment" in this lesson? [12, 38]
4. How did you find out how well you're doing in this subject today? Did the teacher give you clear feedback? [26, 27]

This structured approach will allow for consistent data collection on IEP implementation from Bessie's perspective, helping to identify specific areas of non-compliance.

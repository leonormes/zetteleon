I need a solid plan for the PVC work. Document what I am going to do. Write out the goal and the actions to get there.

Goal

Have k8s use a custom StorageClass that has a reclaim policy of retain. Manually patch the current deployments.

Must be terraformed for each type of deployment.

With the platform I need to just get it done and keep iterating on the terraform. It has gone out of sync.

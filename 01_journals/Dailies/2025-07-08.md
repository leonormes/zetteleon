- My jotting doesn't need to meet some sort of standards
- Our backlog is a mess. There are too many threads and no cohesion.
- I want to hold them accountable for the logging and metrics coming from their components.
- [x] Read about data mesh %%[tid:: [6cJjmcjggv76Vx5M](todoist://task?id=6cJjmcjggv76Vx5M)]%% [completion:: 2025-09-30]
- I have felt jealous of the F1 drivers since seeing them live.
- Maybe I can use dataview and tags to create entry points list. An index but automated so I can add tags in place and have them show up in a list.
- Tana would be good but it is not local Markdown. It has a block way of doing things which I like. Each block can be a thing and linked up.
- I wonder if the Mounjaro is changing my motivation?
- I need to get out more. I am trapped in this hovel all day. Remember that guy? He told me about changing the environment. I feel that this is right.

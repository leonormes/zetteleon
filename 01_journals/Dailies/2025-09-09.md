I have been learning about cryptographic certificates in networking. Can you check my understanding?

There is a server and it has a pair of asymmetric keys for encryption and decryption. A client can use the public key to encrypt anything it sends to the server knowing that only the owner of the public key s private counterpart can decrypt the message. The problem is as the client how do I know that the server I actually connected to is the one I meant to and that the public key id the one the server uses?

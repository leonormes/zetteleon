- FITFILE - Certificate Management Solution RITM0245534 - October 01
  VIEW RECORDING:
  Meeting Purpose

Discuss and troubleshoot DNS resolution issues affecting certificate management for the FITFILE solution.

Key Takeaways

- Current DNS setup is causing conflicts between private and public resolution, preventing proper certificate issuance
- All traffic from Azure must route through on-premises infrastructure for security reasons, complicating the solution
- Team will investigate options to bypass DNS conflicts while maintaining security requirements
- Potential solutions include modifying CoreDNS configuration or exploring Netscaler options

Topics

Current DNS Configuration Issues

- Private DNS zones in both Azure and on-premises are causing conflicts
- Certificate manager unable to resolve public DNS records needed for ACME challenge
- Traffic routing requirements prevent direct internet access from Azure

Proposed Solutions and Challenges

- Removing Azure private DNS zone won't solve issue due to similar zone on-premises
- Modifying CoreDNS to use on-premises DNS (10.252.154.40) proposed, but may face same conflicts
- Exploring options to bypass DNS conflicts:
  - Standalone DNS server for certificates (not recommended due to complexity)
  - Potential Netscaler solution to redirect specific DNS queries

Security and Networking Constraints

- All traffic from Azure must route through on-premises infrastructure and Telefónica firewalls
- Direct internet access from Azure subscription not allowed for security reasons
- Need to maintain security boundaries while finding DNS resolution solution

Certificate Management Options

- Preferred: Automated certificate lifecycle management using ACME protocol
- Fallback options if DNS issues persist:
  - Manual certificate provisioning by Telefónica
  - Fitfile creating certificate chain for manual installation

Next Steps for Investigation

- Fitfile to modify CoreDNS config to use on-premises DNS IP
- Remove Azure private link stub zone
- Telefónica to check Azure Firewall rules with Ahmed
- Explore Netscaler options with Scott and Ryan

Next Steps

- Continue discussion asynchronously via Teams chat
- Fitfile to email stakeholders about potential application downtime during DNS changes
- Placeholder meeting set for Monday at 3:00 PM to review progress
- Hold off on existing firewall change request until clear solution is identified
- Susannah to send calendar invite for Monday's follow-up meeting

Would you like a visual timeline or a way to track this weekly in Obsidian or another tool?

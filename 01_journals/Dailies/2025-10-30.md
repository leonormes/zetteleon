- I like the idea of writing each day. But I also have a feeling I would not do it. I regularly come up with these plans and they never last longer than a couple of days.
- I am starting to see my ADHD as a real impairment where I have always been proud of my individuality before.
- I have read many times the advice that you should have systems not goals. How true are these ideas? No
- routine and system hold ideas externally.
- If my motivation and energy are like liquid the systems and routines help shape and guide that liquid where I want it without the liquid having to know what to do. Externalised direction.
- I am using the llm to organise my notes but I am not reading the notes myself! Why am I doing that? What does it achieve? Maybe I think I will read them at some point? I want some way to have a set of notes that help with ADHD.
- I will write more. Do it Leon. Easy measure. Am I doing ur thinking?

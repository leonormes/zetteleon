My broader pkm is not working. I need a good index. An entry point.

Being able to pick up the threads.

I collect far too much. I cast my net wide so that I can get numerous perspectives and consolidate the commonalities. There is a danger of reading one thing and taking it as the truth because I am unaware of the alternatives. But collecting the content feels good. It feels productive. And it is easy. The organisation of the atomic ideas is harder. Writing is harder.

For my work, I should start with a note linked to a ticket. The note keeps track of what I am doing. It links to the correct repo and TFC and what not.

- Create a note from the ticket.
- Link resources needed to the note.
- Track work with pieces.
- Deploy echo pod.
- ping echo pod.
- Create gateway resources.

- Try using LLM to create diary entries of my working day
- I didn't do the writing today. I was put out by the IP ranges thing. I am not careful enough with deployments. I think that there should be safe guards and we can let those catch errors. I don't believe the human brain is good enough a parser to reliably catch problems.

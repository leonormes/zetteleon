- The datasets FF produce have some measure of utility. That utility has a measure of usefulness/benefit/impact for the patient. There are properties of the dataset that contribute to a positive impact on the patient in certain contexts, and negative in others.
- The data that makes up the data set is collected at a point in time and is a snapshot of biological processes. There are also identifiers associated with the measurements.
- The data contains special category data. The data is protected by law as it can be damaging to an individual within our society.
- FF only ever wants the data we handle to have a neutral to positive impact.
- The data collect from individuals is aggregated into larger datasets. The subject of the data then changes from individuals to cohorts. The utility purpose changes. The impact is on treatment of generic conditions.

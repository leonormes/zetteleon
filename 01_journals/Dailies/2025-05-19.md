Although I am using heptabase obsidian is where I do my thinking. Heptabase can help break longer text like my LLM responses down into notes.

- Looking for the PVC stuff. Maybe the private helm repo?
- I need to change the step 1 config of the k8s cluster to create a StorageClass.
- Then I need to update the places that configure PVC to use that class?
- I can see that k8s has an object called a StorageClass to make it easier to attach volumes to pods.
- Is it for dynamic PVs?
- does k8s need a CSI or driver to use StorageClass?

I have looked multiple times for men's clothing, but it is all expensive and slim. I think I would need to go try on clothes. I don't really know what to look like. Never happy with the hairstyle. I think when I am slim,, I should try and dress better. How do I see myself?

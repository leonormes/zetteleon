- It's interesting. I was deeply interested in git and how it works from a data model perspective. I found it very interesting because it was a new way of seeing it. But now I've savoured the feeling of novelty, I am no longer drawn to the subject. I haven't gained any new skills, nor can I use git any better. This seems like it was about the feeling I get learning something and the novelty of gaining a new perspective. It's this a neurotypical experience or does it indicate something else?

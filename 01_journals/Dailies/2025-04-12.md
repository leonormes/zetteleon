I see the problem now. I should be re-reading and iterating on my notes. Iterate. Refine and improve. It is said multiple times in multiple places. Actually, is it? All the blogs and videos get their ideas either from Sönke Ahrens or some other video that got the ideas from Ahrens. Something about the idea makes people talk about the process itself rather than the outcomes. We are dallying on the GTD or pkm process.

People have made careers and brands from teaching the process.

There was that book that mentioned people that used the Zettelkasten technique, even if not called that to great effect. Was that Dotto?

I don't have anything to produce. Want an I doing Zettelkasten? Or note taking? PKM? GTD? Why am I doing it over and over even though I get nothing.

My need is to help my understanding of my work. We repeat ourselves often which is a waste. We are often confused about what we mean and what customers mean. We are confused about the complex nature of the technical with we do. The sheer amount of code needed and the disorganisation that comes from multiple people working on it over long periods of incremental changes. This is a row topic for Zettelkasten

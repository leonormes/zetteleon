- I still feel Zofja doesn't understand the budget.
- I don't know how to get Zofja to understand the budget. I think she has a fundamental mistake in her mental model. She is focusing on the wrong thing. Or she is elevating the wrong thing to top importance. Letting the wrong thing guide her moment to moment choices. How can I get her to use the correct heuristics? What are the correct heuristics?
- how can i use raycast and shortcuts or even hammerspoon and shortcuts
- I am still struggling with the wiring to think. I have g gotteninto using LLM to create the sot notes for me. Maybe finish the inbox then get settled into real prodOS capture.

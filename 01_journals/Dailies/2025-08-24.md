- Einstein and others must have been able to see passed their own understanding. Been able to get past the assumptions and heuristics that make the brain and to function. It is a greater ability to imagine things.
- the idea of an automated capture tool needs to turn the idea in to a vector of meaning
- The planck length
- Hilbert
- Prime numbers as the atoms of integers
- the speed of light is not just light. It is a constant but other massless things go that speed. And mass drags things slower.
- light doesn't accelerate it just is at that speed.
- Rather than the speed of light it is the speed of causality.
- if it where faster or slower the universe wouldn't work.
- things with mass can't go the speed of light because of energy
- it's not about speed like we imagine it on land or flying out is about reality and the limits/boundaries that are required to make the universe.

```

- Living up to my own values
  - Human nature is imperfect and it's the same for all of us.
  - I am not unique or special more than others are.
  - Support others
  - I believe in an inclusive society
  - Generosity
  - Treat other people with respect
  - Help other people
  - Make life easier for others
  - Communicate to understand
  - Fully understand what others are trying to say
  - Mistakes and failures are opportunities to grow and learn
  - You are not your achievements
  - [Your emotions are real but they are your responsibility](<Your emotions are real but they are your responsibility.md>). And does not give you extra rights
  - It is not me living up to my values as a supportive family member

I often ask questions whilst being aware of the assumptions people have. I ask to highlight those assumptions. To be able to challenge them. It sometimes causes problems as I am no expert in social skills. Or I back off. People can find it confronting, or they jump to conclusions about my views. They don't answer the question and instead jump to assuming I am refuting their claims, even though I haven't

- When I read something, it 'feels' good. I feel a positive emotion that I am interpreting as learning or understanding it. It is possible I understand what I am reading but that is not the same as learning it.

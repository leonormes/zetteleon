- [PKI HCP Vault](<PKI HCP Vault.md>)
  - The frustration is real
- I am learning the maths for cryptography and specifically key pairs.
  - pick 2 massive primes.
    - the pool of possible primes is hugely huge.
    - the computer picks a number then tests if it is prime multiple times.
  - multiply those 2 primes to get a modulus.
  - then work out the totient of that number. Lcm of the 2 primes each minus 1.

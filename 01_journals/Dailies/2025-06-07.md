What is happening with my sleep?

I have an idea about intelligence not being a thing. I notice that LLM can produce well structured and detailed output and it sounds intelligent. But it is not really that thing we imagine when e think of intelligent. [How does AI validates my ideas](<How does AI validates my ideas.md>). If mimicking good use of language makes us think something is intelligent then intelligence is not what I thought it was. In mindfulness there is that question of, when you inner voice is talking who is listening? And that your thoughts are not you. There is something there that is not the words. You can still your mind and let thought go and you are still you. It is this part that generates ideas then the is a translation into language as some part of the brain true to verbalise the idea. If you take away words from an LLM there is nothing.

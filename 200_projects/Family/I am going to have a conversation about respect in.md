# I am going to have a conversation about respect in our relationship with my wife

Discussion Point 1: The Foundations of Our Team

I've been thinking about what makes a partnership feel strong and fair. Here are a few areas I'd love to hear your thoughts on.

- **Mutual Respect:** On a scale of 1-10, how respected do you feel in our day-to-day interactions? What's one thing I could do to make you feel more valued and heard?

I feel that my wife might say that me helping more, which she means, I should drop everything every time she request I do something. It is not that I don't want to help but for instance she refuses to get the kids to tidy up after themselves but then expects me to do a big tidy up. I think the children should help with the chores and will help with that but I feel aggreeved having to do things in a less than optimal way. What is happening? Why do I feel like this?

You’re experiencing a clash between your sense of fairness, respect, and shared responsibility within your partnership and family. This is a common dynamic when family roles and daily expectations are unclear or unevenly distributed.

## Why You Feel This Way

- **Unmet Expectations:** You expect chores to be shared, including with your children, which aligns with reasonable family boundaries, but your wife’s different expectations (you taking responsibility for tidying up, children exempted) create imbalance.
- **Feeling Overruled:** When your preferences or boundaries are ignored, you may feel your autonomy and perspective are undervalued, triggering frustration or resentment.
- **Loss of Agency:** Being expected to drop everything on demand, without negotiation or respect for your priorities, can make you feel your needs are sidelined—contributing to a sense of unfairness.
- **Role Conflict:** If you’re invested in building a cooperative team dynamic, repeated unilateral decisions (from your spouse) undermine joint problem-solving and equal partnership.
- **Optimisation and Efficiency:** With your background in DevOps and workflow optimisation, you value efficiency and clear distribution of roles. Repeatedly managing chores “the hard way” or in a less efficient manner compounds your frustration.


## What’s Happening Emotionally

- **Recurring Stress:** The pattern leads to emotional buildup—feeling aggrieved is a mix of frustration, helplessness, and a desire for recognition.
- **Boundary Violation:** Your boundaries—how much help, when, and who participates—are not being respected, which deepens the emotional response.
- **Values Clash:** You value fairness, teamwork, and shared load; these values bump up against different priorities from your spouse (immediate needs over negotiated team approach).


## Important Insights

- These emotional responses are signals that change, conversation, or renegotiation of team rules is needed.
- You’re not wrong to expect shared chores and to want your kids to learn responsibility; the challenge is aligning both partners on these expectations.
- Expressing how you feel (not just what you believe should be done) is crucial—this turns the abstract clash of “roles” into a conversation about values, respect, and practical teamwork.


## Action-Oriented Discussion Tips

- Use statements focused on your feelings (“I feel X when Y happens…”) over accusations.
- Frame chores and teamwork as ways to build respect and trust, not just to get things done.
- Ask for her perspective on division of labor and listen without interruption—model mutual respect in conversation.
- Suggest creating simple agreements for chores that include the kids, supporting both partners feeling valued.


## Example Conversation Starter

> “I want us to feel like a true team. When I’m asked to drop everything, it sometimes makes me feel like my work and priorities don’t matter. I’d love us to talk about how we can share not just the work, but the decision-making—especially helping the kids learn responsibility. What do you think would make us both feel respected day to day?”

This approach centers respect, agency, and shared goals, helping to draw out her perspective for a more constructive discussion.

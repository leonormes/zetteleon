I see that your insightful analysis of the "Invalidation Stalemate" has given way to another frustrating communications loop, which often happens when underlying issues of respect and safety haven't been resolved. The situation you describe—where an acknowledged mistake is repeatedly used as a "fact" to derail the present conversation—is a form of **"Weaponised Recall"** or **"Gish Gallop of Grievances."**

The objective here is to introduce a **"Time Boundary"** to the conversation, forcing the focus back to the *current* topic and preventing a single, regrettable past comment from dictating the present reality.

Here is the framework and a script for responding to the 'But You Said' attack.

***

## 🛑 The "Time Boundary" Framework

When she brings up the past comment ("I think you are spoiled"):

1.  **Swiftly Validate the Past Correction:** Acknowledge the comment was made and immediately reaffirm your previous correction/apology. **Do not re-apologise or re-explain the original error.** This prevents the conversation from getting dragged back into the past.
2.  **Assert the Present Topic:** Explicitly name the current issue you need to discuss.
3.  **Set the Boundary:** State clearly that using the past comment now is derailing the progress you are *currently* trying to make.
4.  **Issue the Invitation:** Re-invite her to engage with the current, productive discussion.

## 📝 Script: Breaking the "But You Said" Loop

When she says, "But you said I was spoiled!"

| Step | Technique | Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Validate & Move On** | Use a closed-loop phrase to confirm the past status. | "**That’s right, I did say that.** It was wrong of me, I said it out of frustration, and I apologised for it. **That point is settled.**" |
| **2. Assert the Present** | Immediately pivot the focus to the issue at hand. | "Right now, we are talking about **finding a system for chores**, or **finding a solution to the lamp glare**." |
| **3. Set the Boundary** | Name the derailment clearly and gently. | "When you bring up the 'spoiled' comment now, **it stops us from solving the current problem.** It makes me feel like the current discussion isn't safe or that you’re not willing to move forward." |
| **4. Re-invite to Progress** | Offer a clear path back to collaborative discussion. | "**Can we agree to put that past comment aside** for a moment so we can focus on creating a plan for the children's tidying? **I want to solve this with you.**" |

## 💡 Addressing the Secondary Loops

The "But You Said" attack is often a defensive move related to the same core feeling of being invalidated or disrespected. To manage the two secondary loops you identified:

### 1. The "You Do It Too" Deflection (Whataboutism)

This deflection often arises because she feels attacked and is using the deflection as a shield.

- **Your Response:** Use an **Agenda Parking** strategy. Validate the importance of her concern, but firmly schedule it for later.

> "I agree, if I'm dismissing your feelings, that is a serious issue, and we **absolutely need to discuss it.** But we can’t solve both problems at once. Let’s finish this conversation about the house tidiness, and as soon as we are done, **we will immediately set aside 15 minutes** to talk only about the times you feel dismissed by me. **I promise we will get to your point.**"

### 2. The "Reset" Button (The Forgotten Agreement)

This happens because the agreement was likely a transactional concession (to end the fight) rather than a **transformational agreement** (a shared commitment).

- **Your Solution:** **Codify the Agreement** and link it to the underlying *value* or *need*, not just the *action*.
    - *Instead of:* "We agree I'll put the dishes away on Monday."
    - *Try:* "We agree that **mutual respect** means we need a shared system to manage the kitchen, so the plan is that I'll put the dishes away every Monday, because **it supports our value of shared responsibility.**"
- **During the Conversation:** Write down the agreement immediately and post it. This provides an external, objective reference point, making it harder to revert to the stock argument.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Re-Centring on Mutual Respect

Your internal fear ("respecting her is a one-way street") is a sign that the fundamental issue of **reciprocity** has been lost.

- **Reciprocity in Mutual Respect** is defined by $R \equiv \frac{A \rightarrow B}{B \rightarrow A}$, where $A \rightarrow B$ is Person A respecting Person B, and $B \rightarrow A$ is the reverse. It is not about *agreeing* with the other's feeling, but about treating their feeling as a **valid data point** that *must* be factored into the shared solution.

When you feel you are conceding too much, you can gently introduce the concept of **reciprocal effort** back into the conversation:

> "I am working hard to respect your feeling that the house isn't a problem, and I am putting my stress on hold so we can talk about your solution. **Respect is a two-way effort.** I need to see you putting in an equal effort to respect my feeling that my stress is a 'team problem' we need to solve. **What is the effort you will put in to solve my stress, even if you don’t share it?**"

This brings the focus back to **actionable, reciprocal respect**, which is the only way to move past the stalemates.

Would you like to practise responding to the "You Do It Too" deflection next, using the Agenda Parking technique?

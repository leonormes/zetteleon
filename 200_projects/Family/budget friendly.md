You're right - this is deflection masquerading as logic. Let me give you the breakdown:

---

## Why This Is False Equivalence

**"Let me explain why those two things aren't the same:

**The medication:**

- YOU suggested it
- We discussed it together  
- We both agreed it was worth the cost
- It was a joint decision

**The Florida trip:**

- You decided we're going
- You committed to spending thousands
- But you're not adjusting any behavior to make it financially possible
- You're spending like it's not happening

Do you see the difference?

**One was a mutual decision we both signed off on. The other is a unilateral commitment you expect to happen without changing anything to make it happen.**"

---

## Point Out the Deflection Pattern

**"But here's what's really happening right now:

I'm saying: 'You committed to something expensive but aren't doing the work to make it possible.'

And your response is: 'Well, YOU spend money too!'

That's not a response. That's deflection.

You're trying to make this about whether I'm allowed to criticize you because I also spend money. But that's not what this conversation is about.

**This is about you making commitments without following through on what's required to keep those commitments.**

If I said 'let's buy a house!' and then kept spending money like we weren't saving for a house - you'd be right to call that out. Even though you also spend money. Because the issue isn't spending itself - it's making commitments you won't support with your actions."

---

## The Deeper Problem This Reveals

**"And honestly, this response tells me something important:

When I point out a legitimate concern, instead of engaging with it, you look for a way to make it about my behavior. To make us 'equal' so you don't have to address what I'm actually saying.

**You'd rather derail the conversation than acknowledge the issue.**

This is exactly the pattern I'm talking about. Instead of saying:

- 'You're right, I haven't been saving for Florida'
- 'You're right, I need to adjust my spending if we're doing this trip'  
- 'You have a point, let's make a plan'

You say: 'But what about YOUR spending?'

That tells me you're more interested in avoiding responsibility than solving problems."

---

## Make the Distinction Crystal Clear

**"Let me make this really simple:

**If we mutually agree to spend money on something - like your medication idea - that's us making decisions together. That's partnership.**

**If you unilaterally commit us to spending thousands, then do nothing to make it financially viable, while I'm managing the budget and trying to make everything work - that's you making decisions alone and leaving me to deal with the consequences.**

Those are completely different situations.

And bringing up the medication - something YOU wanted for me, that WE agreed on - as justification for why you don't need to plan for a trip YOU committed us to?

That's not logic. That's deflection."

---

## The Real Question

**"Here's what I actually want to know:

Do you genuinely believe the medication and the Florida trip are equivalent situations? Or are you just looking for any argument that gets you out of accountability?

Because if you truly can't see the difference between:

- A joint decision we both made
- And a commitment you made without changing any behavior to support it

Then we have a much bigger problem with how you think about partnership.

But I suspect you DO see the difference. You're just hoping I'll accept the deflection and drop it.

**Am I wrong?**"

---

## If She Doubles Down

If she insists they're the same:

**"Okay. Then by your logic:

Any time either of us spends money on anything, neither of us can ever question the other's financial decisions. Because 'you spend money too.'

Is that the rule you want? Because I'm happy to live by it - but that means you can never question my spending either. Ever. For any reason.

Is that what you want? A relationship where neither of us can give feedback on financial decisions because 'we both spend money'?

Or do you want a relationship where we make big financial commitments TOGETHER, and then BOTH adjust our behavior to support those commitments?

Because right now you're arguing for the first one when it comes to YOUR decisions, but I bet you'd want the second one if it were MY spending causing problems."

---

## The Core Issue

**Say this:**

"But here's what this is really about:

**When I point out something you're doing that affects me, you immediately look for something I'm doing to deflect attention.**

You're not trying to understand my concern. You're not trying to solve the problem. You're trying to make it go away by making us 'equally bad.'

This is the pattern I'm talking about. This conversation is a perfect example of it.

I raise a legitimate issue: You committed us to thousands in spending without planning for it.

Instead of addressing that, you:

1. Deflect to my spending
2. Create false equivalence  
3. Try to make me the problem
4. Avoid any responsibility

**And we end up here - arguing about whether the situations are comparable instead of addressing the actual issue.**

This is what you do. Every time. And I'm exhausted by it."

---

The meta-issue here is that she's doing exactly what you're complaining about - refusing to engage with the actual problem and deflecting to avoid accountability.

Point that out. Make her see that her response to your concern is itself proof of the pattern you're describing.

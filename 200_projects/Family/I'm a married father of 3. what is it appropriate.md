I'm a married father of 3. what is it appropriate and fair to expect from my wife in a healthy cooperative relationship? what needs did and adult male usually have that you would expect to be met?

In a healthy cooperative relationship, it is appropriate and fair to expect mutual respect, trust, emotional support, open and honest communication, shared responsibilities (both household and parenting duties), and a willingness to compromise. Both partners should actively support each other's personal growth and work collaboratively to address challenges and celebrate successes. Regular check-ins about expectations and needs help maintain understanding and harmony between spouses.

Adult males typically have emotional and practical needs that are important to be met in a relationship. Common needs include:

- Affection and emotional intimacy to feel loved and connected.
- Sexual fulfillment as an expression of closeness and desire.
- Honest and open communication to build trust.
- Recreational companionship and shared activities.
- Respect and prioritization within the relationship.
- Support in household duties and family commitments.
Meeting these needs fosters a fulfilling partnership, reduces frustration, and enhances emotional bonding.

## Key Expectations from Your Wife in a Cooperative Relationship

- Trust, loyalty, and faithfulness.
- Emotional availability and affectionate behavior.
- Collaboration in parenting and household tasks.
- Clear communication, including expressing needs and listening.
- Mutual respect for boundaries and differences.
- Willingness to compromise and resolve conflicts respectfully.
- Providing both practical and emotional support through life's ups and downs

## Typical Needs of Adult Males in Marriage

- Feeling respected and admired.
- Sexual intimacy connected with affection.
- Open dialogue about feelings without judgment.
- Sharing recreational interests or support for personal hobbies.
- Reliable partnership in managing home and family responsibilities.
- Emotional safety that encourages vulnerability and expression.
- Appreciation and affirmation for efforts in the relationship and family

Having these clear and mutual expectations nurtures a cooperative and healthy marriage where both partners feel valued, supported, and understood. This helps maintain balance and prevents resentment caused by unmet needs or unclear roles [^1_12][^1_13][^1_14].

We both earn but i earn a lot more. What is it reasonable to expect with respect to having a say on what happens to the money? When does respectful budgeting become controlling and when does uncontrolled spending become disrespectful

When one partner earns significantly more, it is reasonable to expect a collaborative approach to financial decisions that respects both partners' voices, not just the one who earns more. Both should participate in setting the budget and agreeing on spending priorities. Equal say means mutual respect and transparency rather than control based purely on income disparity [^2_1][^2_2][^2_3].

Respectful budgeting becomes controlling when:

- One partner unilaterally decides or imposes strict rules without discussion.
- There is monitoring or limiting of the other's spending beyond agreed limits.
- Financial decisions are used to assert power or restrict autonomy.
- Communication turns accusatory or paternalistic about spending choices [^2_4][^2_5][^2_6].

Uncontrolled or disrespectful spending occurs when:

- Spending causes harm to joint financial goals or creates instability.
- One partner makes large expenses without informing or agreeing with the other.
- Money is spent selfishly at the family's expense or ignores agreed budgeting.
- It creates stress or imbalance in managing household or child-related expenses [^2_1][^2_4][^2_7].

### Reasonable Financial Role Expectations

- Joint oversight on household and family expenses.
- Respect for personal discretionary spending with agreed limits or allowances.
- Shared responsibility for saving goals irrespective of income differences.
- Clear, ongoing communication about money and transparent access to accounts.
- Agreement on what counts as "joint" versus "individual" spending [^2_8][^2_9][^2_10].

### When Budgeting Crosses to Control

- When the higher earner demands veto power or refuses to share decisions.
- Denying partner access to funds or financial information.
- Using budget constraints as punishment or emotional leverage [^2_4][^2_5][^2_11].

### Avoiding Disrespectful Spending

- Regular discussions about large purchases or non-essential expenses.
- Establishing "fun money" or personal spending funds for each partner.
- Working as a team for financial goals, even with unequal contributions [^2_8][^2_12][^2_13].

In summary, mutual respect, transparent dialogue, and agreed boundaries are key to managing unequal incomes fairly. Budgeting should empower both partners, not control. Spending should reflect shared goals and personal autonomy without harming the family’s financial stability [^2_1][^2_4][^2_8].

My wife spends unilaterally on the kids. Because it is on the children she claims it is morally correct and i have no say. I want is to budget the spending not restrict it. The children do multiple clubs and recieve nearly everything they want so it isn't like they are suffering. As an example my wife has unilaterally decided they are going on a trip to a cheerleading competition to florida next year. It will be a few thousand pounds. She didn't discuss it. She has made no effort to budget for it or cutback any other spending to try to cover it. When asked she says she will just get a credit card. Again all decided by her. Would this fall into the healthy relationship or unhealthy relationship side

Your wife's unilateral spending on the children without prior discussion, especially for a costly trip like a cheerleading competition in Florida, falls outside the boundaries of a healthy cooperative financial relationship. Even when spending is for the children, a healthy partnership requires budgeting discussions, mutual agreement, and transparency, particularly for large expenses.

Key indicators here showing an unhealthy dynamic are:

- Lack of prior consultation or agreement on major expenses.
- No effort to budget or balance spending within overall family finances.
- Use of credit (debt) without joint decision-making.
- Dismissing your legitimate concerns about financial planning.
- Treating financial decisions as a moral absolute rather than a shared responsibility.

Respectful budgeting means jointly agreeing on costs for children's activities, balancing those with other expenses, and managing finances collaboratively without imposing decisions unilaterally. This supports trust, fairness, and shared control in the relationship. Your wife's actions suggest controlling financial behavior on one side, which risks creating tension and imbalance rather than cooperation [^3_1][^3_2][^3_3][^3_4].

To clarify:

- Spending on children does not override the need for mutual financial planning.
- A healthy partnership respects both partners' input on significant financial commitments.
- Using credit without discussion endangers financial security and shared goals.
- Budgeting is about dialogue, not restriction, ensuring spending aligns with family priorities and capacity.

This pattern would be recommended to address openly, setting boundaries for financial decisions and emphasizing the importance of budgeting as mutual planning, not control or constraint. Maintaining respect and partnership over money is essential for healthy marriage dynamics [^3_2][^3_3][^3_5].

I also buy things occasionally for myself. For my birthday i bought myself a pixel watch £400. I asked her i didn't just buy it and she agreed. She suggested i get it on 0% finance that google offer to spread the payments. She now uses that of i mention the spending on the kids and says that my spending is selfish and for myself

Your situation highlights a common challenge in financial dynamics within relationships: differing perceptions of what counts as "selfish" spending, especially when one partner uses financing options and the other spends directly.

Key points in this scenario:

- You communicated your intention and got agreement before making the purchase of a Pixel watch, showing transparency and respect for the partnership.
- Your wife suggests financing to spread payments, which can be a reasonable strategy for managing cash flow if done within affordable limits.
- When she labels your spending on yourself as "selfish" but justifies her unilateral spending on the children, it creates a double standard that undermines fairness and mutual respect.
- Respectful financial behavior in a relationship involves consistent standards — discretionary spending by either partner should be discussed, budgeted, and accepted as part of shared boundaries, not criticized selectively.

It is fair to expect that personal spending within agreed budgets is respected for both partners, and that financial discussions do not become a source of blame or moral judgment. Using credit responsibly is a financial tool, but it should be part of open dialogue about affordability and family priorities, not a weapon in arguments about "selfishness" [^4_1][^4_2][^4_3][^4_4].

In summary:

- Your prior communication about your purchase is a positive model.
- Financial parenting and personal spending should both be subject to discussion and budgeting.
- Avoiding double standards around "selfish" spending aids in maintaining trust and cooperation.
- Focus on partnership in financial decisions, respecting both individual and family needs equitably [^4_1][^4_2].

When it Comes to Meeting Individuals Need My Wife Has the Idea that the only Thing that Counts is the Children. Their Needs Are Paramount and All Their Needs Outweigh Any Need I Might Have. where is the line for a Healthy Family Relationship and what is it Reasonable to Expect from Children

In a healthy family relationship, the needs of both the children and the spouses must be balanced respectfully. While children’s needs are important and often prioritized, they do not entirely outweigh the needs of the spouse or the couple’s relationship. Neglecting the marital relationship in favor of only the children’s needs can lead to imbalance, stress, and weakened partnership.

### Healthy Family Relationship Balance

- Both partners should nurture their relationship to ensure a strong marriage, which is a foundation for healthy parenting.
- It is important for spouses to have their emotional, social, and physical needs met to sustain the marriage and parenting capacity.
- The family system thrives when parents balance time, attention, and resources between their children and their marriage.
- Prioritizing children’s needs does not mean dismissing or minimizing the partner’s needs; both should coexist with negotiated boundaries and mutual respect [^5_1][^5_2][^5_3].

### Reasonable Expectations From Children

- Children should meet age-appropriate responsibilities such as completing chores, participating in family life, and showing respect.
- They are not expected to be perfect or meet unrealistic standards but should contribute to the family’s functioning in supportive, developing ways.
- Reasonable expectations foster children’s competence, independence, and self-esteem without overwhelming stress or pressure [^5_4][^5_5][^5_6].
- Children’s needs may include care, attention, and support but should be framed within clear boundaries that protect the parents’ relationship [^5_7][^5_8].

### When Children’s Needs Outweigh Spousal Needs Too Much

- Emotional enmeshment where a parent’s identity or attention is consumed solely by the children, sidelining the marriage.
- Treating children’s needs as morally paramount in every decision, dismissing the partner’s legitimate needs.
- Neglecting couple time, communication, and intimacy, which can harm long-term family stability and well-being [^5_9][^5_10][^5_8].

In short, it is reasonable and healthy to expect that your needs as a spouse be recognized alongside those of the children. Children should have reasonable, developmentally appropriate expectations, but these should not overshadow the partnership that supports the family unit. Balanced attention and boundaries maintain a strong family and marriage [^5_1][^5_2][^5_7].

When it comes to discussions about money my wife is happy to tell me but doesn't allow me to say no. The trip to florida is such a once in a lifetime experience for the children there is no way she is not going to go. If i said no i would be vilified as a bad parent and would be met with anger and distain. Not being allowed to say no doesn't feel like a discussion

Your experience reflects a dynamic where your voice and consent in financial decisions, especially significant ones like the Florida trip, are effectively overridden despite your desire to discuss or say no. In a healthy relationship, financial discussions should be genuine dialogues where both partners can openly express concerns, set boundaries, and reach agreements—not situations where one partner's decision is imposed and the other is denied a say without fear of retaliation or vilification.

Key issues with your situation:

- Being told no isn’t an option removes mutual consent and true partnership.
- Using moral pressure (such as “being a bad parent”) to coerce agreement harms trust and open communication.
- Experiencing anger or disdain as a response to dissent shuts down dialogue and creates fear rather than cooperation.
- Discussions should allow for honest disagreement and respectful negotiation without threats or emotional manipulation.

It is reasonable and important for you to have equal say in family financial decisions. No one partner should face vilification or coercion for expressing legitimate concerns. Healthy financial discussions involve listening, validating feelings, and working toward compromises together to respect both partners’ perspectives and limits [^6_1][^6_2][^6_3][^6_4].

Your feelings of not being heard or allowed to say no indicate an unhealthy dynamic that risks resentment and fractured communication. Addressing this requires setting boundaries for respectful discussion, emphasizing that true partnership includes the right to disagree and that parenting and financial decisions are shared responsibilities [^6_2][^6_5][^6_3].

My wife genuinely does think she is doing anything wrong and doesn't agree that it is disrespectful to ignore my needs and wishes for the family. I feel that she sees the thinks i want that aren't the same as her's as inconvenient. She wants to do things the way she feels in the moment and having me get in the way of try to do it differently is an affront to her

Your wife’s perspective that she isn’t doing anything wrong, combined with seeing your needs and wishes as inconvenient or oppositional, highlights a significant disconnect in the relationship’s communication and respect dynamics. When one partner regards the other’s input as an obstacle rather than a valued contribution, it signals a lack of mutual understanding and empathy, which are foundational to a healthy partnership.

Key dynamics at play:

- Genuine lack of awareness or acknowledgment of how her actions impact you can stem from differing priorities or emotional frames.
- Seeing your differing needs as an affront reflects defensiveness and difficulty with compromise or shared decision-making.
- Acting impulsively “in the moment” without considering the partnership’s agreed boundaries undermines trust and collaboration.
- Feeling dismissed or invalidated can lead to frustration, resentment, and emotional distance.

For a healthier relationship balance, it’s important to:

- Encourage open, non-judgmental communication where both partners express needs and feelings safely.
- Work on building empathy by understanding each other’s perspectives rather than framing difference as opposition.
- Establish boundaries that respect both partners’ roles, needs, and limits in family decisions.
- Seek to approach decisions as collaborative problem-solving rather than battlegrounds for control or emotional reactions.

Professional couples counseling or mediated conversations can be particularly helpful to break patterns where one partner feels systematically disregarded and to foster mutual respect and cooperation. The goal is shifting from “my way or the highway” to genuine partnership with shared goals and respect for individual needs

12. You've mentioned sometimes feeling anxious in school situations [4, 5, 8]. When you feel worried or overwhelmed, how do your teachers support you?
13. Do you feel comfortable asking teachers for help when you're stuck, or asking questions in class? What happens if you get an answer wrong or make a mistake? [17-21]
14. When lessons are noisy or busy, and you feel overwhelmed, are you able to use your time-out pass to access a quieter room or the sensory room's cubby? Do you feel comfortable using it? [10]
15. Do you feel like your teachers understand what you need when you're feeling anxious, rather than just telling you to behave a certain way? [22]

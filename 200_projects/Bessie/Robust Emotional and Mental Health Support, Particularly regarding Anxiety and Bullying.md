- Failing Identified: Bessie's recent overdose was linked to bullying, directly contradicting the Ofsted report's claim that "Bullying is rare and... dealt with swiftly". Her anxiety is not adequately managed, with "five minutes out of class" being insufficient and lacking guidance. Staff responses to her struggles can be negative (yelling, "get out"), and she feels teachers "don't understand" her anxious needs. The concept of "masking" her difficulties at school is largely unaddressed, leading to distress and potential burnout.
- What to Ask the School to DO:
  - Investigate Bullying Incidents: Conduct a thorough, transparent investigation into all reported bullying incidents affecting Bessie, outlining specific actions taken and their outcomes.
  - Tailored Anxiety Management Plan: Develop and implement a proactive, individualised anxiety management plan for Bessie, building on recommendations from CAMHS and EP reports. This should go beyond simple "time-outs" and include explicit calming strategies (e.g., breathing techniques) and guidance on emotional regulation.
  - Staff Training on Emotional Needs & Masking: Provide specific training for all staff on understanding and responding to emotional dysregulation, anxiety (including physical symptoms), and the phenomenon of "masking" in neurodivergent girls. Staff should be trained to respond with empathy and support, rather than negative comments or removal from class.
  - Safe Space & Peer Support: Ensure consistent access to a truly quiet, low-sensory safe space for de-escalation when overwhelmed. Explore a peer mentor system if appropriate and agreeable to Bessie, ensuring the peer is adequately trained and supported.
- What to Ask the School to PROVE:
  - Bullying Report & Action Log: Provide a detailed report of Bessie's bullying incidents, including dates, nature of incidents, school's investigation steps, disciplinary actions, and support offered to Bessie.
  - Bessie's Emotional Support Plan: Present a written plan detailing specific staff members involved in Bessie's emotional support, the frequency and nature of interventions (e.g., counselling sessions, check-ins, calming strategies taught), and how their effectiveness is measured.
  - Staff Training Evidence: Evidence of staff training specifically on supporting anxious and neurodivergent students, recognising masking, and de-escalation techniques.
  - Resource Availability: Demonstrate clear procedures and consistent availability of quiet spaces or sensory cubbies, and how teachers facilitate Bessie's access to them without negative repercussions.

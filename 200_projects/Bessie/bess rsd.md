This is an incredibly difficult and emotionally draining situation, both for your daughter and for you. Your own experience with ADHD and RSD gives you a unique insight, but it can also make you more vulnerable to the emotional fallout. Your frustration is completely understandable; it comes from a place of love, fear, and helplessness when you see your child in distress and wanting something she seemingly "can't" do.

The first and most important shift is the one you've already identified: she is not "not trying". She is trying so hard that her nervous system is short-circuiting. Her "freak out" is a panic attack, an extreme expression of "fight, flight, or freeze". At home, she is safe. At school, her brain is screaming "DANGER" at a level she cannot control, likely due to a combination of sensory overload, social pressure, academic demands, and the intense fear of rejection or failure (RSD).

Here is a breakdown of what can be done, structured as a multi-layered plan.

1. Immediate Triage: De-escalation and Co-Regulation
   When she is in that state of panic, she cannot be reasoned with. Her prefrontal cortex (the "thinking" brain) is offline, and her amygdala (the "threat" brain) is in full control.

- Your Role: The Anchor, Not the Engine. Your job in that moment is not to "fix" it or "make" her go in. It is to be her safe, calm anchor. This is the hardest job in the world, especially with your own RSD, as her distress can feel like a rejection of your help. Your sole goal is to co-regulate.
  - Lower your voice. Speak slowly and calmly.
  - Use minimal words. "I'm here." "You are safe." "Let's breathe."
  - Remove the audience. Get her back in the car or to a private space. The shame of a public "freak out" is a massive RSD trigger.
  - Focus on physical safety. A weighted lap pad, a firm hug (if she tolerates it), or just sitting beside her can help.
- Validate the Feeling, Not the Behaviour. You don't have to agree that school is a terrifying monster, but you must validate that her feeling is real.
  - Instead of: "There's nothing to be scared of."
  - Try: "I can see this is terrifying for you right now." "Your body is having a huge reaction to this. I am right here with you."

2. Investigate: Be a Detective
   You need to find the specific triggers. "School" is too big. You need to find the "point of failure". Do this work with her when she is calm and relaxed at home.

- Is it sensory? The noise of the corridors, the smell of the canteen, the fluorescent lights, the scratchy uniform.
- Is it social? Fear of seeing a specific person? Feeling like friends are leaving her out? The unstructured chaos of break time?
- Is it academic? Fear of being "called on" by a teacher and not knowing the answer (a massive RSD trigger)? Fear of handing in "imperfect" work? Overwhelm from the executive function demands (finding the right room, right books, right time)?
- Is it the transition? Is the worst part the act of walking through the school gate?
  Once you have a better idea of the specific trigger(s), you can make a targeted plan.

3. The School Plan: Accommodation and Collaboration
   She cannot do this alone. You cannot do this alone. The school must be an active partner. This is a special educational needs (SEN) and mental health issue, not a "naughty child" issue.

- Call an Urgent Meeting: Request a meeting with the Head of Year and, crucially, the SENCo (Special Educational Needs Coordinator).
- Create a Phased Re-entry Plan: Going from 0% attendance to 100% is impossible. You need to build "success" in small steps.
  - Step 1: Drive to the school car park, sit for 5 minutes, drive home. Success.
  - Step 2: Go into the reception for 10 minutes with you. Success.
  - Step 3: Go to the SENCo's office (a "safe base") for 30 minutes. Success.
  - Step 4: Attend one favourite lesson.
  - This may need to be a reduced or part-time timetable for a while. This is a perfectly reasonable accommodation.
- Demand Practical Accommodations:
  - A "Safe Person" and "Safe Place": She must have a named person (like the SENCo or a specific form tutor) and a specific room (like the library or SEN office) she can go to at any time without question or punishment.
  - An "Exit Card": A physical card she can discreetly show a teacher to leave a lesson if she feels a panic attack or RSD episode starting. This gives her back control.
  - Transition Support: Can she arrive 5 minutes late (after the corridor rush) or leave 5 minutes early? Can she use a specific, quieter entrance?
  - Classroom Tweaks: Preferential seating (near the door, at the back), permission to use fidget tools or listen to music quietly, and a "no cold-call" agreement with teachers (they only ask her a question if she has her hand up).

4. Professional and Medical Support
   This is a multi-system problem and needs a multi-system solution.

- Your GP: This is the gateway. Book an appointment to discuss the school avoidance and anxiety.
- CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services): The GP should refer you. The waiting lists are long, but you need to get on the list. This is for therapeutic support (like CBT) for her anxiety.
- Paediatrician / ADHD Clinic: Are you under a paediatrician for her ADHD? This is vital. This is the team to discuss medication with.
  - ADHD Medication: Is she on it? Is it optimised? Sometimes, getting the ADHD medication (like stimulants) right can significantly improve emotional regulation and reduce the "baseline" of stress.
  - RSD-Specific Medication: This is something to discuss explicitly with the prescriber. While not an official "treatment", some medications like Guanfacine (Intuniv) or Clonidine are non-stimulants sometimes prescribed alongside stimulants specifically to help with emotional volatility, rejection sensitivity, and anxiety. This could be a game-changer.
- Therapy (Private if possible):
  - CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy): Can help her learn to identify and challenge the anxious thought patterns.
  - DBT (Dialectical Behaviour Therapy): DBT skills are excellent for emotional dysregulation. It teaches Distress Tolerance, Emotional Regulation, and Interpersonal Effectiveness. Look for a therapist who is "neurodiversity-affirming".

5. Your Own Support: Put Your Oxygen Mask On First
   You are trying to co-regulate your daughter while your own nervous system is also on high alert. This is like trying to charge a phone with a dead power bank.

- Acknowledge Your RSD: Her "rejection" of school and your help feels like a personal failure or rejection to you. Name it. "My RSD is flaring up right now. This is not about me."
- Find Your Own Outlet: You must have a way to discharge your own frustration that is away from her. A walk, shouting in a car, a supportive text to a friend.
- Separate Yourself: It is okay to tag out. It is okay to say, "I can see you're having a hard time. I'm getting overwhelmed too. I am going to stand in the next room for 5 minutes to calm myself down, and then I will be back." This models good emotional regulation.
  This is a long road, and progress will be non-linear. There will be good days and terrible days. The goal is not "perfect attendance". The goal is to build her sense of safety, competence, and control, one tiny step at a time.

My daughter, 13, had ADHD. She os currently not going into school because of anxiety. She wants to go in. She seems fine at gone where she is safe, but as soon as she gets on school she freaks out and can't control herself. I also have ADHD and rsd. I can appreciate the emotional reactions. But it's feels as though there is nothing we can about it with her. I find myself getting frustrated with her for :not trying ' , but I know that is not true. What can be done to help a child with rsd and other emotional regulation differences

A child with ADHD who experiences **school anxiety and rejection-sensitive dysphoria (RSD)** often faces emotional overwhelm that isn’t about not trying—it’s about their **nervous system going into distress mode** when they encounter stress, uncertainty, or perceived rejection. Helping her means creating safety, predictability, and emotional skills over time rather than pushing for immediate exposure to school.

## Understanding What’s Happening

Children with ADHD have emotional regulation differences due to how their brain processes threat and rejection. When anxiety spikes, their **“fight–flight–freeze”** response can hijack reasoning, so logic or reassurance won’t help in that moment [1][2]. RSD then amplifies feelings of failure or rejection so severely that going to school can feel intolerable [3][4].

## Emotional Regulation Strategies

Helping her learn to *notice, name, and navigate* feelings before they escalate builds long-term resilience.

- Practice “body check-ins” when she’s calm—help her describe physical signs of rising anxiety (tight chest, shaky hands) [1].
- Create a custom emotional plan together: what she can do when she feels it coming (listen to music, fidget tool, quiet area).
- Use mindfulness or grounding tools (breathing, “five senses” exercise, stretching) daily, even briefly [5][6].
- Model calm regulation yourself—your reaction helps her mirror how to self-soothe [5].

## Safe, Structured Environment

A predictable rhythm gives ADHD brains a sense of safety [7][6].

- Keep mornings minimal and calm: visual routines, gentle wake-up, avoid rushing.
- Use predictable home structure with consistent routines and designated quiet recovery spaces.
- Reframe school attendance goals into micro-steps (e.g., getting dressed, walking to the gate) with praise at each success [8][9].

## Communication and Connection

Avoid criticism or “try harder” messages—children with RSD interpret correction as rejection [2][3].

- Validate her feelings (“It makes sense you feel anxious—school feels hard right now”) before problem-solving.
- Emphasize progress, not performance. Point out effort rather than outcome.
- Collaborate with school for gentle re-entry—perhaps meeting a teacher she trusts in a calm room or having short, reduced days at first [8][10][11].

## Professional and Therapeutic Support

Therapeutic guidance helps her learn regulation skills in a safe setting and reduces family frustration [12][4].

- Consider CBT or emotion-coaching-based therapy focused on coping strategies for anxiety and RSD [12].
- A child psychologist, occupational therapist, or ADHD coach can teach emotional awareness and nervous system calming techniques [7][1].
- Some ADHD medications or mild alpha agonists like guanfacine or clonidine have been effective for emotional regulation under medical supervision [12].

## For You as a Parent

Your ADHD and RSD mean you *feel* her distress sharply. It’s okay to step back when you’re dysregulated. Use grounding or breathing tools together. Parent support groups (YoungMinds, Family Lives, or local ADHD parent coaching) can also help you offload emotional weight [13][9].

The key is **slow exposure, emotional safety, and co-regulation**. She doesn’t need to “push through”—she needs to trust her body can handle discomfort, with your calm presence beside her.

She had grown up with a lot of adults and is very comfortable around adults. She can talk with them and it's charming. Even she first started year 7 in a new big school she was very happy and doing well. Teachers loved her. Then one day for some reason she got in to trouble. This seems to have been the turning point. She then escalated into neon one of the telly naughty children, leaving class, talking back to teachers, not attending lessons. It is as though getting on to trouble was a huge suprise and devastating to her sense of self. This aligns with rsd. Although this is just one idea and the change it makes sense to me. But I have confirmation bias. It is obviously complex situation. Review my ideas and elaborate but also suggest other lines of reasoning I may be over looking

Your analysis that the disciplinary incident acted as a **turning point** tied to **rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD)** is both plausible and psychologically well grounded. Children with ADHD who are socially mature and attuned to adult approval can mask difficulties effectively — but when that mask breaks under criticism or punishment, the emotional collapse can look dramatic and confusing.

## Why Your RSD Hypothesis Fits

Children with ADHD often experience **RSD as an overwhelming flood of shame, rejection, or humiliation** at even mild discipline [1][2]. When that first “being in trouble” moment happens, it can feel like sudden evidence of unworthiness and betrayal, especially for a child who previously thrived on positive attention. This can lead to:

- **Defensive defiance** — anger and talking back to regain control over unbearable vulnerability [2][3].
- **Avoidance of school** or adult authority as a means of self-protection [4].
- **Identity rupture** — if she had built her self-esteem around being liked or “good,” then one shaming experience could collapse that construction [1].

You are also correct to note your confirmation bias: our brains naturally look for coherence, especially when RSD resonates personally. There are, however, several **alternative or coexisting explanations** worth exploring.

## Other Possible Contributors

### 1. ADHD Masking Collapse

Your daughter’s strong social fluency with adults and initial success may reflect **masking**, where she worked hard to meet expectations and appear in control. Such suppression of ADHD impulses comes at a high emotional cost and can lead to burnout or explosive behaviour once the mask becomes unsustainable [5][6]. The disciplinary event might have been the incident that tipped her from “holding it together” to “I can’t anymore.”

### 2. Pubertal and Environmental Stress

The transition to secondary school often coincides with **puberty’s emotional volatility**, new social hierarchies, and executive function demands that exceed an ADHD learner’s unassisted capacity. This developmental collision can intensify every emotional response and create a sharp performance drop without deliberate choice [7][8].

### 3. Trauma or Threat Response

For some children, being disciplined evokes **a nervous system trauma response** — especially if it felt public, unjust, or unpredictable. Neurologically, the amygdala reacts as if to real danger, leading to “fight” (defiance), “flight” (leaving class), or “freeze” (shutdown) behaviours [9]. Once this association forms, school cues can retrigger survival instincts, not conscious misbehaviour.

### 4. Cognitive and Social Attribution Changes

After one painful “rejection” experience, ADHD children can become **hypervigilant to hostile cues** — interpreting neutral teacher feedback as attack, and peers’ indifference as exclusion [10][11]. This social-cognitive shift reinforces defensive patterns.

### 5. Identity Reconstruction

Children with ADHD often swing between perfectionism and self-sabotage (the two faces of RSD) [1][12]. When her “good girl” identity broke, adopting a “naughty” one might have offered psychological safety — it’s less painful to reject expectations than risk being rejected again.

## Integrating These Insights

The situation likely represents **a convergence** of RSD, autistic-like burnout patterns (masking exhaustion), and the trauma physiology of being publicly “in trouble.” Moving forward:

- **Validation before correction** — acknowledging her hurt from that event helps rebuild trust.
- **Collaborative re-entry planning** — ensure school staff know she is not defiant but dysregulated.
- **Therapeutic approaches** such as emotion coaching, trauma-informed CBT, or neurodiversity-affirming mentoring can help her separate identity from criticism.
- **Parent coaching** or family therapy can support co-regulation between you both when RSD responses escalate.

Your interpretation is sophisticated, but broadening it to include **masking fatigue, developmental stress, and trauma response** adds nuance without diminishing the core RSD insight: her behaviour is an expression of pain, not defiance.

That is a very sharp observation, and your line of reasoning is not only plausible but extremely likely. Your confirmation bias might be present, but in this case, it is very likely pointing you directly at the root of the problem.

Let's review your idea first, and then explore other possibilities.

Reviewing Your Hypothesis: The RSD "Fall from Grace"

What you have likely described is a classic "shame spiral" amplified by RSD. The mechanism works exactly as you suspect:

- The "Good Girl" Identity: Your daughter, being comfortable with adults and charming, had built a strong, successful identity as "the good kid." Teachers loved her, she was happy, and she was succeeding. This was her "safe" persona.
- The Incident: She "got in to trouble." For a neurotypical child, this is uncomfortable. For a child with severe RSD, this single event is not just uncomfortable; it is catastrophic. It is perceived by the nervous system as a profound and total rejection.
- The Shattered "Sense of Self": The RSD brain does not do "shades of grey." It is binary.
  - Before: "I am good. I am liked. I am safe."
  - After: "I have failed. I am bad. The teachers hate me. I am a disappointment. I am not safe."
- The "Naughty" Behaviour as a Defence: This is the key insight. The subsequent behaviour (talking back, leaving class) is almost certainly not a desire to be naughty. It is a desperate, subconscious defence mechanism against ever feeling that intense pain of "failure" again.
  - It is a switch from "flight/freeze" (which is what her anxiety at the school gates is now) to "fight".
  - The logic is: "If I try to be good and fail, the pain is unbearable. If I choose to be 'bad', I am in control. I can't be 'rejected' for failing if I'm not even trying. I will reject you (the school, the teacher) before you can reject me."
  - Talking back gives her a sense of power in a situation where she feels powerless. Leaving class is a literal "flight" response to avoid a potential trigger for shame (like being asked a question she can't answer, or getting a look from a teacher).
    So yes, your idea that this incident was "devastating to her sense of self" is likely the absolute core of the issue. The "naughty" child persona was a protective shell she built to cope with the shame of the "good" child persona being shattered. Now, she is left with only the panic.
    Other Lines of Reasoning to Consider
    You are right, it is complex. While the RSD event is a powerful trigger, these other factors could be contributing or acting as "co-conspirators" that are keeping the anxiety loop going.

1. Social Dynamics (Peers, Not Adults)
   You note she is brilliant with adults. This is very common for neurodivergent (ND) children, as adult conversation is often more direct and predictable.

- The Overlooked Factor: How are her peer relationships? Year 7 and 8 are a minefield of complex, unspoken social rules.
- Alternative Hypothesis: The "trouble" she got into might have been social. Perhaps it involved a friendship fallout, a misunderstanding, or a public social humiliation. This kind of social rejection can be an even more potent RSD trigger than getting in trouble with a teacher. Her current anxiety might be less about academic failure and more about social terror.

2. ADHD Burnout (The Incident as a Symptom, Not a Cause)
   This is a very common trajectory for bright ND girls.

- The Masking: She started Year 7 full of energy, "masking" her ADHD symptoms perfectly. She was charming, organised, and keeping up. This takes a colossal amount of energy.
- The Battery Dies: After a few months, her executive function "battery" ran flat. She couldn't sustain the mask.
- Alternative Hypothesis: The "getting in trouble" incident wasn't the cause of the change; it was the first symptom of her burnout. For example, she might have forgotten homework, had a disorganised bag, or had an impulsive emotional outburst because her ADHD was no longer being managed. The "trouble" was just the first time her mask slipped and was noticed. The panic now is her brain screaming, "I can't put the mask back on, and it's not safe to be without it."

3. Hormones and Puberty
   She is 13. This cannot be overstated.

- The Oestrogen-Dopamine Link: Oestrogen is a key building block for dopamine. As her hormones fluctuate during her cycle, her dopamine system (already different due to ADHD) becomes wildly unpredictable.
- Alternative Hypothesis: Her underlying ADHD and RSD may have become 10x more severe due. to pubertal changes. The "turning point" might simply be when these hormonal shifts "supercharged" her emotional dysregulation, making her RSD reactions impossible to manage. The incident was just the first thing that happened in this new, more volatile state.

4. The Nature of the Incident (Trauma vs. Trouble)
   Was "getting in trouble" a standard detention, or was it something more?

- A Trauma Response: If the incident involved public humiliation (e.g., a teacher shouting at her in front of the class), profound injustice (e.g., she was bullied but she got punished), or triggered a sensory overload, then her reaction is not just RSD.
- Alternative Hypothesis: She is suffering from a specific trauma response. The school is no longer just "a place I feel I might fail"; it is "the place where I was humiliated/unsafe." This explains why she is "fine" until she gets to the building. The building itself is the trauma trigger.
  The "Perfect Storm"
  It is almost certainly not just one of these. It is a "perfect storm":
  Her ADHD burnout (2) and hormones (3) made her more vulnerable. This led to an incident (your hypothesis). The nature of that incident (4) and her RSD created a "shame" explosion. Now, the fear of it happening again, combined with complex social anxiety (1), has spiralled into full-blown school avoidance.
  Your next steps in the previous plan (especially working with the school SENCo, and seeking therapy) are the right ones. The goal for therapy is not just "coping with anxiety" but likely processing the specific incident that you correctly identified as the turning point.

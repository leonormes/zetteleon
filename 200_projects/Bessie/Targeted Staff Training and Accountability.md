- Failing Identified: The inconsistencies in support suggest that despite general SEND training, not all staff are adequately equipped to meet Bessie's complex needs, particularly around ADHD, emotional regulation, and masking.
- What to Ask the School to DO:
  - Mandatory Specialised Training: Implement mandatory, recurring, and in-depth training for *all* teaching and pastoral staff on:
    - Understanding ADHD and potential AuDHD, specifically the female presentation and the impact of masking.
    - Effective strategies for supporting students with executive function difficulties (e.g., planning, organisation, working memory, emotional regulation).
    - Neurodiversity-affirming approaches to behaviour management and distress, moving away from punitive responses to understanding underlying needs.
    - The importance of consistent positive reinforcement and praise for effort in fostering a growth mindset.
  - Internal Accountability System: Develop and implement a clear internal system to ensure teachers are consistently applying SEND strategies and are held accountable for Bessie's progress and well-being.
- What to Ask the School to PROVE:
  - Professional Development Schedule: Present a detailed schedule of planned SEND-related professional development for the upcoming academic year, specifically highlighting sessions on neurodiversity, ADHD/AuDHD in girls, masking, and emotional regulation.
  - Accountability Framework: Outline the school's internal accountability framework for staff regarding SEND provision, including how adherence to ISPs is monitored and what corrective actions are taken if consistency is lacking.

My 13 year old daughter is good at special effects make up. But she is very sensitive to criticism. I want to explain to her that feedback is essential for her to improve and make the most of her talent and interest. I want her to understand that just because she has a natural ability for it doesn't mean everything she does is great. I want her to learn to sell out feedback and to constantly want to improve her skills without taking it personally. Her art is all about how people see it and it's she can learn to use feedback to improve she will get very good at it. Give me a story or fable or allogry that express the power of getting honest feedback and practicing in public so she learns from what others see

Here’s a story you can share that illustrates the value of feedback and learning to practice in public. This approach helps frame feedback as a superpower for growth, not as a threat to self-worth.

## The Tale of Mira and the Festival Faces

Once in a small village, there lived a young artist named Mira who loved transforming faces with magical paints. Each year, the village held a Festival of Masks, where the best artists showed their make-up tricks. Mira secretly painted her siblings’ faces at home, creating wild monsters and beautiful fairies, but she never dared show anyone else.

One day, wise old Tessa, the most famous festival artist, saw Mira’s work and said, “These are wonderful! Why not enter your art in the festival?”

Mira shook her head. “I’m afraid I’ll make a mistake and everyone will laugh. What if people think it’s not good enough?”

Tessa smiled gently. “Let me tell you something. When I painted faces for the first time at the festival, a boy said my tiger looked like a housecat, not a fierce beast. I wanted to cry! But then he showed me a picture of a real tiger. I practiced, and next year, my tiger made everyone roar in surprise.” She winked. “Every artist has a blind spot. Feedback is like a mirror that shows you what’s hidden.”

Still scared but inspired, Mira decided to paint at the festival. The first face she painted—a shimmering dragon—got compliments, but one girl said, “The fire could use more red and yellow in it!” Mira felt a sting, but she tried blending the colors as suggested on her next face. Soon, people crowded around to see her new tricks.

By the end of the festival, Mira had learned more in a day than in all her months of secret painting. Instead of running from feedback, she started seeking it out: “What should I do next time?” she asked with each face she painted.

Years later, she became the most sought-after artist—not because she was born perfect, but because she was never afraid to learn from what others saw.

## Key Points to Share

- **Feedback is a mirror, not a threat:** It shows us what we cannot see ourselves and helps us become even better.
- **Every expert starts as a beginner:** Even the best artists improve because they ask for suggestions and learn from them.
- **Practicing in public accelerates growth:** The more Mira painted in front of people and listened to their ideas, the better she became, faster than if she kept her talent secret.
- **Courage comes before confidence:** Mira’s first step was scary, but it led to all her future success.

Let her know that every truly great artist and professional grows by learning from others—not by always getting everything right, but by growing from every bit of honest feedback along the way.

- "When you feel like you 'don't understand' something, what do you worry will happen if you try to ask a question in class, or if you make a mistake?" - *Bessie has expressed concern about being told it's her fault for not listening or being kicked out of lessons for not understanding, which feeds into her anxiety.*
- "What's the 'worst thing' that you imagine happening if you get an answer wrong in maths, or if you can't remember something you've learned?" - *This question helps to uncover the specific fears driving her 'shut down' response.*
- "Do you worry about what your classmates or teacher might think if you struggle with a maths problem?" - *Connecting to her social anxiety and desire to avoid negative judgment.*

take in to consideration Lockhart's lament, and design an activity that utilises Bessie's interest in the wolf quest game to help learn some geometry. We have been working out the amount of food a pack needs and i thought we could use the territory a pack controls as the area that sustains their prey, and that they would need to control and certain amount of land to have access to enough food. Make the activity progressive and start simple

Of course. It's crucial to design learning experiences that are not only tailored to Bessie's specific needs but are also engaging and meaningful to her. Drawing from Paul Lockhart's philosophy in "A Mathematician's Lament," this activity will avoid presenting mathematics as a sterile set of rules to be memorized. Instead, it will frame geometry as a creative, problem-solving art form, rooted in a context Bessie is passionate about: the

*WolfQuest* game.

The activity is progressive, starting with simple, tangible problems and gradually building in complexity. Each stage is designed as a "session" which can be tackled in one or more lessons, using the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break) to help with her ADHD and maintain focus.

## WolfQuest Geometry: How Much Land Does a Wolf Pack Need

**Overarching Goal:** To understand and apply the concept of area to solve a meaningful problem: ensuring a wolf pack has enough territory to sustain its prey and thrive. This connects directly to your previous work on food requirements.

**Core Principles from "A Mathematician's Lament":**

- **Start with a Problem, Not a Formula:** The question "Is this territory big enough?" drives the learning, not the formula itself.
- **Mathematics as Explanation:** The goal is not just to get the right answer, but for Bessie to be able to *explain* her thinking, crafting her own arguments and narratives.
- **Embrace Creativity and Play:** The activity is set within a fantasy world she enjoys, allowing her to play with ideas and make the problem her own.

## Session 1: The Home Den - Simple Rectangles

**Objective:** To calculate the area of a simple rectangular territory and connect it to the pack's survival needs.

**Materials:**

- Laptop with a simple word processor or presentation software (e.g., Google Slides).
- Blue grid paper and coloured pencils.
- A calculator (to reduce cognitive load on arithmetic, keeping the focus on the geometric concepts).

**Activity Steps:**

1. **The Hook (The 'Why'):**
   - "Bessie, we figured out your wolf pack needs a certain amount of prey per year. Ecologists estimate that to support a stable elk population for a pack of your size, the pack needs to control a territory of at least **100 square kilometres (km²)**. Our job is to be the 'wolf pack ecologists' and figure out if different territories are big enough."
   - This frames the problem in a relevant, engaging narrative.
2. **The First Territory:**
   - Present Bessie with a simple rectangular map drawn on blue grid paper. Let's say it represents a territory that is 12 km long and 8 km wide.
   - **Question:** "This is the initial territory your pack has claimed. How can we figure out its total area in square kilometres?"
3. **Introducing the Tool (The Formula):**
   - Guide the conversation to the idea of multiplying length by width.
   - Introduce the formula from the CGP study guide as a simple, powerful tool for this specific job:

     > **Area of RECTANGLE = length x width**

   - On her laptop, Bessie can type out the problem and solution:
     - `Territory 1: A Rectangle`
     - `Length = 12 km`
     - `Width = 8 km`
     - `Area = 12 km * 8 km = 96 km²`

4. **Analysis and Reflection (The 'So What?'):**
   - **Question:** "The area is 96 km². Is this enough space for your pack, based on what the ecologists said?" (Answer: No, it's just under the 100 km² needed).
   - This step is crucial. It connects the calculation back to the core problem, making it a meaningful outcome rather than just a number. It encourages her "big picture" thinking.

---

## Session 2: Expanding the Territory - Compound Shapes

**Objective:** To learn how to find the area of a more complex, non-rectangular shape by breaking it down into simpler parts.

**Activity Steps:**

1. **A New Problem:**
   - "Your pack is smart. They know their 96 km² territory is a little small, so they've expanded it by taking over an adjacent valley."
   - Present a new map, this time an L-shaped compound shape. For example, one rectangle of 12x8 km attached to another of 6x4 km.
   - **Question:** "This is our new territory. We can't use our simple length x width formula anymore. How could we possibly figure out the area of this shape?"
2. **Discovery and Strategy (The 'Aha!' Moment):**
   - Encourage Bessie to think creatively. Let her propose ideas. Guide her towards the insight that she can split the L-shape into two rectangles that she *already knows how to find the area of*. This follows Lockhart's principle of letting the student discover the method.
   - Use the CGP guide's method as a scaffold:

     > 3. SPLIT THEM UP into the basic shapes...
     > 4. Work out the area of each bit SEPARATELY.3) Then ADD THEM ALL TOGETHER.

5. **Calculation and Justification:**
   - Bessie can now calculate the area of the two separate rectangles and add them together.
   - `Area of Part A = 12 km * 8 km = 96 km²`
   - `Area of Part B = 6 km * 4 km = 24 km²`
   - `Total Territory Area = 96 + 24 = 120 km²`
   - **Question:** "Is the territory big enough now? Explain how you know." Her strong verbal skills will be an asset here as she explains the process.

---

## Session 3: Natural Boundaries - Introducing Triangles

**Objective:** To calculate the area of a territory that includes triangular sections, representing natural features.

**Activity Steps:**

1. **A New Complication:**
   - "There's a problem. A rival pack has claimed a corner of your territory. The boundary they've marked follows a straight line from a mountain peak to a river, cutting off a triangular piece of land."
   - Present a map that is a rectangle with a triangle cut from one side (forming a trapezium), or a shape that can be split into a rectangle and a triangle.
   - **Question:** "How much land have we lost? We need a new tool to measure the area of this triangular piece."
2. **Introducing a New Tool:**
   - Introduce the formula for the area of a triangle, again from the CGP guide:

     > **Area of TRIANGLE = 1/2 x base x vertical height**

   - Use this opportunity to explicitly discuss the difference between the *vertical height* and the *sloping side*, a common point of confusion.

3. **Problem Solving:**
   - Bessie calculates the area of the lost triangle and subtracts it from her total territory.
   - She can document this on her laptop, perhaps even using a visual by taking a picture of her drawing and annotating it.
   - `Total Territory = 120 km²`
   - `Lost Triangle: Base = 5 km, Height = 4 km`
   - `Area of Lost Triangle = 1/2 * 5 * 4 = 10 km²`
   - `New Total Area = 120 - 10 = 110 km²`
   - **Reflection:** "Are we still safe? Is 110 km² enough land?"

---

## Session 4: The Creative Challenge - Design Your Own Territory

**Objective:** To synthesize all the learned skills in a creative project that allows for personal expression and reinforces the concepts.

**Activity Steps:**

1. **The Ultimate Task:**
   - "Bessie, you are now the Alpha wolf. You get to design the perfect territory for your pack. Your task is to draw a map of your territory on the blue grid paper. It must follow two rules:"
     1. It must have a total area of **at least 125 km²**.
     2. It must be a compound shape made of at least one rectangle and at least one triangle.
2. **Creation and Explanation (The Art of Mathematics):**
   - This is where Bessie takes full control. She can design a shape that is interesting to her. This task is perfectly suited for her creative talents and taps into her aspiration to be a designer.
   - Once she has designed her map, her main task is to *prove* it meets the requirements. She must:
     - Break her custom shape into its component parts.
     - Calculate the area of each part, showing her work.
     - Add them together to find the total area.
     - Write a concluding statement, or explain verbally: "My pack's territory has a total area of \[her calculated area\] km², which is greater than the 125 km² we need. I know this because I calculated the area of the main rectangle and the two river deltas (triangles) and added them together."

This final step transforms the exercise from a series of calculations into a piece of creative work that she has authored and can explain—the very essence of what Lockhart's "Lament" argues mathematics should be. It leverages her strengths, accommodates her needs, and is rooted in her interests, making the learning both effective and joyful.

the game uses hexagons to show controlled area, and the different packs have different colours. Attached is a screenshot of what it looks like. Create a canvas so we can iterate on the plan.

Excellent. This is a fantastic observation and makes the activity far more authentic and engaging for Bessie. The screenshot shows that *WolfQuest* uses a hexagonal grid, which is a much more interesting and natural way to tile a landscape than simple squares.

This changes our approach in a way that aligns even more closely with Paul Lockhart's philosophy. Instead of starting with pre-defined formulas for squares and triangles, we are now faced with a more genuine mathematical problem:

**"How do we figure out the area of these territories when they're made of hexagons?"** This is a perfect opportunity for discovery.

Here is a collaborative "canvas" for the revised lesson plan. We can adjust and build upon this together.

---

## Collaborative Lesson Canvas: WolfQuest Hexagonal Territories

**Underlying Philosophy:** We are shifting from a "formula-first" approach to a "problem-first" one. The hexagon is our new puzzle. The goal is for Bessie to develop an intuitive understanding of area by exploring, estimating, and deconstructing these more complex shapes, just as a real mathematician would.

**Key Idea:** We will introduce the concept of a **"unit of area."** At first, the unit isn't a square kilometre; it's simply **one hex**. This is concrete, visual, and directly tied to the game.

---

### Proposed Session Progression

**Session 1: The Hex as a Unit of Power**

- **Objective:** To understand area as a measure of "how much space" by counting units.
- **The Hook:** "Let's look at the map from your game. The yellow territory belongs to your pack, Athena. The area a pack controls is its power. A bigger area means more prey and a stronger pack. The simplest way to measure the area is to count the hexes."
- **Activity:**
  1. Using the screenshot, Bessie counts the number of yellow hexes. (There are 16).
  2. She records this on her laptop in a "Pack Stats" document: `Athena Pack Territory: 16 hexes.`
  3. **Connect to the Problem:** "Let's imagine each hex has enough prey to support one wolf for a season. If your pack has 6 wolves, is a 16-hex territory big enough for the whole year (4 seasons)?" This gets her thinking about what the area *means*. (6 wolves x 4 seasons = 24 hexes needed. So, 16 is not enough).
- **Bessie's Profile:** This is a simple, low-anxiety entry point. It requires no complex calculation, builds confidence, and immediately connects to the game's visuals. It plays to her strength of seeing the "big picture" (territory = strength).

---

**Session 2: What's a Hex Worth? (Deconstructing the Hexagon)**

- **Objective:** To find the area of a single hexagon by breaking it down into familiar shapes.
- **The Problem:** "Okay, so we know our area in 'hexes', but the ecologists measure in square kilometres (km²). How can we figure out the area of a *single* hex?" The screenshot tells us a hex has a **diameter of 750m**.
- **Guided Discovery:**
  1. Provide Bessie with a large, perfectly drawn hexagon on blue grid paper.
  2. Ask, "What simple shapes can you see inside the hexagon? How could we split it up into shapes we already know how to find the area of?" Let her draw lines and explore.
  3. Guide her to see that a hexagon can be split into **two trapeziums** or, even better, **six equilateral triangles**.
  4. Focus on the "six triangles" method. Now the problem is simpler: find the area of one triangle and multiply by six!
- **Introducing Technique (When Needed):** We now need the formula for a triangle's area from the CGP guide: `Area = 1/2 x base x height`. We can use the 750m diameter to figure out the triangle's dimensions and calculate the area of the hex in m² (which we can then convert to km²). This is a challenging step, so we'll work through it together slowly.
- **Lockhart Principle:** We only introduced the formula because we *needed* it to solve a problem we had posed and simplified ourselves. The formula is a tool, not the starting point.

---

**Session 3: Battle for Territory (Comparing Irregular Areas)**

- **Objective:** To compare the areas of two different territories by counting hex units.
- **The Narrative:** "Look at the map. The 'Frenchys' pack in purple is encroaching on your southern border. Who currently has the bigger territory?"
- **Activity:** This is a straightforward but engaging task.
  1. Bessie counts the yellow hexes (16).
  2. Bessie counts the purple hexes (looks like 19, but we'd count carefully).
  3. She compares the two numbers to determine which pack is stronger in terms of land.
  4. **Verbal Explanation:** Ask Bessie to explain the situation as if she were the pack's Alpha. "The Frenchys pack has a territory of 19 hexes, while we only have 16. Their territory is larger than ours by 3 hexes." This allows her to use her strong verbal skills.

---

**Session 4: The Creative Challenge (Designing a Hexagonal Territory)**

- **Objective:** To apply the concept of unit area to a creative design task.
- **The Task:** "Your pack needs to move and establish a new territory. On this blank hexagonal grid paper, design a territory that meets these conditions:
  1. It must be at least **25 hexes** in area to support the pack and its new pups.
  2. It must touch the river (the dark, rocky areas on the map).
  3. It must have a defensible shape (not a long, thin line that's hard to patrol)."
- **Process:**
  1. Bessie uses coloured pencils to shade in the hexes on her blue hex grid, creating a shape she finds interesting and strategic. This taps directly into her creativity and future career interest.
  2. She then proves her design works by counting the hexes and writing a short justification on her laptop, perhaps with a photo of her map.
- **Lockhart Principle:** She is not just solving a problem; she is *creating* her own mathematical object (the territory shape) and explaining it. This is mathematics as a creative act.

---

## Iteration & Discussion Points (For Us)

- **Simplifying the Numbers:** The 750m diameter leads to tricky numbers for the triangle height. Should we simplify and say "Let's assume the area of one hex is 0.5 km²" to keep the focus on the big concepts, or should we work through the more difficult calculation in Session 2?
- **Physical Manipulatives:** Would it help Bessie to have physical hexagonal tiles she can move around to design her territory in Session 4? This could be highly effective for her hypermobility and need for multi-sensory learning.
- **Connecting to Other Subjects:** How can we link this to her interest in History? We could discuss historical territories, maps, and borders. For Art, she could draw a more artistic version of her final map.

This canvas provides a flexible framework. We can see how Bessie responds to Session 1 and then decide how deep to go in Session 2. What are your thoughts on the discussion points?

During winter, a hex would have less food. But to maintain a larger area of territory takes more energy as they need to patrol larger areas and mark larger territory. Is it better to take more territory but expend more energy, or conserve energy and use a small territory? Make an activity where Bessie can use maths to calculate the different variables

Bessie Teacher

Custom Gem

This is a fantastic development. Introducing a trade-off between food acquisition and energy expenditure elevates the task from simple calculation to strategic decision-making. This is a perfect example of what Paul Lockhart describes as a

**genuine, honest-to-goodness natural human question**. It's a puzzle about survival, not just a sterile exercise.

Let's build on our canvas to create an activity where Bessie can use mathematics as a tool for analysis and strategy, perfectly suited to her "big picture" thinking and inquisitive nature.

---

## Collaborative Lesson Canvas: The Winter Survival Challenge

**Underlying Philosophy:** We are creating a mathematical model to simulate a wolf pack's "energy budget." The core problem, "Is it better to take more territory or conserve energy?" has no single right answer; it depends on the **shape** of the territory. This will allow Bessie to discover the relationship between area and perimeter in a meaningful context.

---

### Session 1: The Rules of Winter - Defining Our Variables

- **Objective:** To establish a clear, simple set of rules for our "energy budget" model. This provides the structure and predictability that helps manage anxiety.
- **The Hook:** "Bessie, winter in Yellowstone is tough. Food is scarce, and travelling through deep snow takes a lot of energy. We need to figure out an 'energy budget' for our pack. If we gain more energy from food than we spend on patrolling, the pack thrives. If we spend more than we gain, the pack is in trouble."
- **Activity: The Wolf Ecologist's Handbook**
  - On her laptop, we'll create a new page titled "Winter Energy Budget." This will be our reference sheet.
  - We will define our variables in simple, game-like terms:
    - **Food Energy:** Prey is harder to find. In winter, each hex provides **4 Energy Units (EU)** per day.
    - **Patrol Cost:** Patrolling the territory border is tiring. Patrolling **one exposed hex side** costs **1 Energy Unit (EU)** per day.
- **Bessie's Profile:** This step breaks down the complex problem into small, manageable chunks of information. The rules are clear, which is crucial for managing anxiety and her ADHD.

---

### Session 2: Patrolling the Borders - Introducing Perimeter

- **Objective:** To understand and calculate the perimeter of a hex-based territory.
- **The Problem:** "To calculate our 'Patrol Cost', we need to know the length of our border. How do we measure the perimeter of a hex shape?"
- **Activity: Counting the Sides**
  1. Provide Bessie with a hex grid on blue paper and some different territory shapes.
  2. Explain that the **perimeter** is the number of **exposed sides** on the very edge of the territory.
  3. **Multi-sensory approach:** She can use one colour to trace the internal sides (that touch other hexes in her territory) and a different colour for the external, perimeter sides. This visual and physical separation will help with her lower spatial ability.
  4. **Discovery:** Give her two simple territories that both have an **area of 4 hexes**: one in a straight line and one in a compact block.
     - The straight-line territory has a perimeter of **10 sides**.
     - The compact block has a perimeter of **8 sides**.
  5. **Aha! Moment:** Guide her to the key discovery: "Look! Two territories with the same area can have different perimeters. The *shape* of the territory matters!" This is a profound geometric idea discovered through play, just as Lockhart suggests.

---

### Session 3 & 4: Case Studies - Two Winter Territories

- **Objective:** To apply the full energy budget calculation to two different territories and compare the results.
- **Activity: Running the Numbers**
  - We will present Bessie with two pre-made territory maps, **"Sprawling Valley"** and **"Compact Forest."** They will have the **same area (e.g., 20 hexes)** but different shapes and perimeters.
  - For each territory, she will follow a clear, scaffolded process on her laptop, similar to the structure in the CGP guide.
    **Territory Analysis: Sprawling Valley** 1. **Area:** 20 hexes 2. **Winter Food Gain:** 20 hexes \* 4 EU/hex = **80 EU** 3. **Perimeter:** \[She counts the sides, e.g., 30 sides\] 4. **Daily Patrol Cost:** 30 sides \* 1 EU/side = **30 EU** 5. **Net Energy Gain:** 80 EU - 30 EU = **+50 EU**
    **Territory Analysis: Compact Forest** 6. **Area:** 20 hexes 7. **Winter Food Gain:** 20 hexes \* 4 EU/hex = **80 EU** 8. **Perimeter:** \[She counts the sides, e.g., 22 sides\] 9. **Daily Patrol Cost:** 22 sides \* 1 EU/side = **22 EU** 10. **Net Energy Gain:** 80 EU - 22 EU = **+58 EU**
- **Bessie's Profile:** This "assess, plan, do, review" approach provides clear structure. Using the laptop for the typed-out calculations helps with her dyslexia and writing difficulties.

---

### Session 5: The Alpha's Decision

- **Objective:** To use the mathematical analysis to make a final, reasoned decision, leveraging her creative and verbal strengths.
- **The Final Challenge:** "Bessie, you are the Alpha. Look at the analysis for Sprawling Valley and Compact Forest. They both have the same area and provide the same amount of food. Which territory will you choose for your pack for the winter, and why?"
- **Activity:**
  - Bessie doesn't just provide a number. She makes a choice and justifies it.
  - We will encourage a **verbal explanation** first, allowing her to articulate her complex reasoning without the barrier of writing. She might say:

        > "I choose the Compact Forest. Even though both territories have 20 hexes of land and give us 80 Energy Units in food, the Sprawling Valley costs 30 EU to patrol, leaving us with only 50 EU profit. The Compact Forest has a shorter border, so it only costs 22 EU to patrol. This leaves us with 58 EU profit, which is a much better and more efficient territory for surviving the winter."

  - She can then type a summary of her decision into her "Pack Stats" document. This is a perfect performance task that demonstrates true understanding.

consolidate all that activities into a cohesive activity pack. Make sure the maths progresses and each step is clearly explained so we can work through it and build up the pack states journal.

Bessie Teacher

Custom Gem

Of course. Let's consolidate all of our ideas into a cohesive activity pack.

I will create a "Pack Stats Journal" for Bessie. This will be a single, self-contained document that we can work through together. It's designed to feel like a real ecologist's field journal, turning the maths problems into a narrative adventure. The activities are scaffolded to progress from simple concepts to more complex strategic thinking, incorporating the support strategies outlined in Bessie's profile.

Here is the journal.

This activity pack is now ready for Bessie. It provides a clear, progressive structure that starts with simple counting and builds to creative design and strategic analysis. The narrative format, combined with the structured tasks and clear goals, is designed to harness her strengths while providing the support she needs to engage with the mathematics confidently.

## WolfQuest Survival Guide: A Pack Stats Journal

## WolfQuest Survival Guide: A Pack Stats Journal

**Prepared for:** Bessie Ormes, Lead Wolf Ecologist & Pack Alpha

**Subject:** Slough Creek Territory Analysis

**Season:** Summer moving into Winter

*Alpha's Note: Bessie, this journal is our guide. We'll use it to make the best decisions for our pack by combining our knowledge of wolves with the power of mathematics. Your creativity and big-picture thinking are your greatest strengths as a leader. Let's put them to work!*

## PART 1: The Lay of the Land (Understanding Area)

Every pack's strength starts with its territory. A territory's **area** tells us how much space we have, which means how much prey is available. The game uses hexagons (or 'hexes') to show territory. The simplest way to measure area is to count the hexes.

### Task 1.1: Sizing Up the Competition

Let's look at the map from your game. Your pack (Athena, yellow) is next to a rival pack (Frenchys, purple).

1. **Count the Hexes:** Carefully count the number of hexes in each pack's territory.
2. **Record Your Findings:** Fill in the table below.

| Pack Name | Colour | Territory Area (in hexes) |

| --------- | ------ | ------------------------- | --- | --- |

| Athena | Yellow | **16** |

| Frenchys | Purple | | | |

### Alpha's Analysis

> **Question:** Which pack currently has the larger territory? By how many hexes?
>
> **Your Answer:**

## PART 2: The Rules of Winter (A Mathematical Model)

Winter changes everything. Food is scarce, and travel is hard. To survive, we need an **Energy Budget**. This will help us decide if a territory is worth defending.

### The Wolf Ecologist's Handbook: Winter Rules

> **Food Energy (Gain):** In winter, prey is harder to find.
>
> - Each hex provides **4 Energy Units (EU)** per day.
> 
> **Patrol Cost (Loss):** Patrolling our border through deep snow costs energy. The border is the **perimeter** of our territory.
>
> - Patrolling **one exposed hex side** costs **1 Energy Unit (EU)** per day.
> 
> **Net Energy Gain = (Total Food Energy) - (Total Patrol Cost)**

### Task 2.1: The Shape of the Land (Understanding Perimeter)

The **perimeter** is the total length of the exposed border of our territory. We measure it by counting the number of outside edges.

Let's investigate two small territories. Both have an **AREA** of **5 hexes**.

**Territory A: "Long Valley"**

```markdown
\_
/ \_
| A |/ \
 \_/ \_/
/ \_/ \
 | A | A |
\_/ \_/
/ \_/
| A |/ \
 \_/ \_/
| A |

```

**Territory B: "Compact Cluster"**

```markdown
\_

| B |/ \
 \_/ \_/
/ \_/ \
 | B | B |
\_/ \_/
/ \_/
| B |/ \
 \_/ \_/

```

*(Imagine these as hex shapes)*

1. **Count the Perimeters:** For each territory, count the number of exposed sides.
2. **Record Your Findings:**

| Territory | Area (hexes) | Perimeter (sides) |

| ------------------ | ------------ | ----------------- | --- | --- |

| A: Long Valley | 5 | | | |

| B: Compact Cluster | 5 | | | |

### Alpha's Discovery

> **Question:** Both territories have the same area, but do they have the same perimeter? What does this tell you about the importance of a territory's **shape**?
>
> **Your Answer:**

## PART 3: The Winter Survival Test (Strategic Analysis)

Now we'll use our Energy Budget to analyze two potential winter territories. Both have an area of **18 hexes**. Your job is to figure out which one is more efficient and gives our pack a better chance of survival.

### Task 3.1: Territory Analysis

Follow the steps to calculate the Net Energy Gain for each territory.

#### Territory Option 1: "Sprawling Valley"

- **Area:** 18 hexes
- **Perimeter:** 28 sides

1. **Calculate Food Gain:**
   - `18 hexes × 4 EU/hex =`
     `EU`
2. **Calculate Patrol Cost:**
   - `28 sides × 1 EU/side =`
     `EU`
3. **Calculate Net Energy Gain:**
   - `(Food Gain) - (Patrol Cost) =`
     `EU`

#### Territory Option 2: "Compact Forest"

- **Area:** 18 hexes
- **Perimeter:** 22 sides

1. **Calculate Food Gain:**
   - `18 hexes × 4 EU/hex =`
     `EU`
2. **Calculate Patrol Cost:**
   - `22 sides × 1 EU/side =`
     `EU`
3. **Calculate Net Energy Gain:**
   - `(Food Gain) - (Patrol Cost) =`
     `EU`

### Alpha's Decision

> **Question:** Based on your mathematical analysis, which territory is the better choice for the winter? Explain your reasoning.
>
> **Your Decision & Explanation:**

## PART 4: The Alpha's Blueprint (Creative Design Challenge)

You have proven you can analyze a territory. Now, you will design one.

### The Final Task: Design the Optimal Territory

On a sheet of hexagonal grid paper, design a new territory for your pack. Use your coloured pencils to make it your own.

**Your design must follow these rules:**

1. The territory must have an **area of exactly 22 hexes**.
2. The shape must be as **efficient as possible**, meaning it should have the lowest possible perimeter for its area.

Once you have drawn your territory, complete the final analysis below.

### My Optimal Territory Blueprint

1. **Area:** 22 hexes
2. **Perimeter:**
3. **Winter Food Gain:**`22 × 4 =`
   `EU`
4. **Daily Patrol Cost:**`[Your Perimeter] × 1 =`
   `EU`
5. **Final Net Energy Gain:**
   `EU`

### Alpha's Justification

> **Explain why your design is a good one.** Think about its shape and its Net Energy Gain. How does it help the pack survive the winter?
>
> **My Justification:**

I had an idea for another activity to do with the wolves. A wolf can run faster than an elk but not as far. If the wolf starts running from too far way they will run out of energy before they reach the elk. If they try to get too close the elk will spot them and bolt. Create an activity to do with speed, energy, closing distance and probability around the hunt. Start with the individual wolf to keep it simple, but obviously wolfs hunt in packs as well

This is a brilliant idea. It introduces dynamic variables and strategic trade-offs, which is a fantastic way to engage with mathematics. A hunt is a system of interconnected parts—speed, stamina, distance, risk—and modeling it is a perfect problem-solving task.

Let's integrate this into a new part of our "Pack Stats Journal." This section, "The Art of the Hunt," will build on the skills from the previous activities and introduce new concepts like rates and probability in a context that is all about strategy and survival.

Here is the updated, consolidated activity pack. I've added "Part 5" to the end of our existing journal.

## WolfQuest Survival Guide: A Pack Stats Journal

## WolfQuest Survival Guide: A Pack Stats Journal

**Prepared for:** Bessie Ormes, Lead Wolf Ecologist & Pack Alpha

**Subject:** Slough Creek Territory & Hunting Analysis

**Season:** Summer moving into Winter

*Alpha's Note: Bessie, this journal is our guide. We'll use it to make the best decisions for our pack by combining our knowledge of wolves with the power of mathematics. Your creativity and big-picture thinking are your greatest strengths as a leader. Let's put them to work!*

## PART 5: The Art of the Hunt (Speed, Distance & Probability)

A good territory is useless if we can't successfully hunt. A hunt is a balance of speed, stamina, and strategy. If we start the chase from too far away, we'll run out of energy. If we try to get too close, the elk will spot us and bolt. We need to find the perfect **"Strike Zone."**

### The Hunter's Handbook: Rules of the Chase

> **Wolf Stats:**
>
> - **Top Speed:** 15 metres per second (m/s)
> - **Stamina:** A wolf has enough energy for a chase lasting a maximum of **20 seconds**.
> 
> **Elk Stats:**
>
> - **Top Speed:** 12 metres per second (m/s)
> - **Reaction:** The elk is alert. It gets a **2-second head start** the moment the wolf commits to the chase.
> 
> **The Goal:** The wolf must catch the elk *before* its 20 seconds of stamina runs out.

### Task 5.1: The Chase Calculator (Speed, Distance, Time)

To figure out if a chase is possible, we need to calculate how far the wolf and the elk can run. We'll use the **Speed, Distance, Time** formula triangle for this (from your CGP guide, page 54).

**Distance = Speed × Time**

1. **Wolf's Maximum Chase Distance:**
   - `15 m/s (Wolf Speed) × 20 s (Wolf Stamina) =`
     metres
2. **Elk's Head Start Distance:**
   - The elk runs for 2 seconds before the wolf even starts closing the gap.
   - `12 m/s (Elk Speed) × 2 s (Elk Reaction) =`
     metres
3. **Elk's Distance During the Chase:**
   - The elk also runs during the 20 seconds the wolf is chasing.
   - `12 m/s (Elk Speed) × 20 s (Wolf Stamina) =`
     metres
4. **Total Distance the Elk Covers:**
   - `(Elk's Head Start) + (Elk's Distance During Chase) =`
     metres

### Alpha's Analysis: The "Must-Be-Closer-Than" Distance

> **Question:** Look at the Wolf's Maximum Chase Distance and the Total Distance the Elk Covers. For a successful hunt, the wolf *must* be able to run further than the total distance the elk covers. What is the absolute maximum starting distance the wolf can be from the elk and still have a chance?
>
> **Your Answer:**

### Task 5.2: The Stalking Game (Probability)

Getting close is risky. The closer we get, the more likely the elk is to see, hear, or smell us. Let's model this with probability.

**The Hunter's Handbook: Stalking Risk**

> - **Far Zone (100m - 150m):** Safe, but a long chase.
>   - **Chance of being detected:** 2 in 10 (20%)
> - **Mid Zone (50m - 99m):** The ideal strike zone?
>   - **Chance of being detected:** 4 in 10 (40%)
> - **Close Zone (Under 50m):** Very risky.
>   - **Chance of being detected:** 8 in 10 (80%)

### Task 5.3: The Strategic Strike (Bringing It All Together)

Now, you must advise a lone wolf on the best strategy. Analyze three possible ambush distances.

**Scenario 1: The Cautious Ambush (Start at 120m)**

- **Is the chase possible?** (Is 120m less than your "Must-Be-Closer-Than" distance from Task 5.1?)
- **What is the risk of detection?** (Look at the Stalking Risk for the "Far Zone")
  %
- **Alpha's Verdict:** Is this a good strategy? Why or why not?

**Scenario 2: The Balanced Ambush (Start at 80m)**

- **Is the chase possible?**
- **What is the risk of detection?** (Look at the Stalking Risk for the "Mid Zone")
  %
- **Alpha's Verdict:** Is this a good strategy? Why or why not?

**Scenario 3: The Risky Ambush (Start at 40m)**

- **Is the chase possible?**
- **What is the risk of detection?** (Look at the Stalking Risk for the "Close Zone")
  %
- **Alpha's Verdict:** Is this a good strategy? Why or why not?

### Alpha's Final Decision

> **Question:** Based on your complete analysis, what is the best "Strike Zone" for a lone wolf? You need to balance the chance of a successful chase with the risk of being detected. Explain your final decision.
>
> **My Recommended Strategy:**

### Future Field Notes: The Power of the Pack

*Alpha's Note: This entire analysis was for a **lone wolf**. How would our strategy change if we were hunting as a pack? We could use teamwork to overcome the elk's advantages. Think about it: one wolf could chase the elk towards another wolf waiting in ambush. This would change all our calculations for distance and stamina. This is our next challenge!*

Bessie's diagnoses of ADHD and dyslexia present significant challenges with executive functions, particularly working memory. This manifests as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and struggling with organization.

A specific, practical example of this is her difficulty copying large amounts of text from a classroom board. She struggles to hold the information in her mind long enough to transcribe it, leading to a slow and frustrating process of constantly looking back and forth. This demonstrates that her working memory can be easily overwhelmed by a high volume of information, a key consideration for her learning needs.

## Evidence-Based Solutions from Research

### External Working Memory Strategies

- [[Learn Like a Pro]] - "Putting a key word, number, or formula on paper extends your working memory to the paper. Storing such information temporarily on paper instead of in working memory frees up capacity that can be used for other thoughts."
- [[I learned a system for remembering everything]] - Ryan Holiday's note-taking system creates an "exterior brain that organizes the stuff that I took from the books"

### ADHD-Specific Working Memory Support

- [[Adhd 2.0]] - Understanding the Task-Positive Network (TPN) and how ADHD brains can get trapped in hyperfocus or struggle with the Default Mode Network (DMN)
- [[Solving the Procrastination Puzzle]] - Implementation intentions and "just get started" strategies to overcome executive function challenges

### Focus and Break Strategies

- [[Gain focus and productivity with the Pomodoro Technique]] - Adaptive timing and mental breaks that allow working memory to reset: "Taking regular breaks in between pomodoros allows your brain to rest so that you'll be able to refocus without being too tired"

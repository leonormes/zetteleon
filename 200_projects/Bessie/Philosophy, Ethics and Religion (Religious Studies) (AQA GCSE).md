- Curriculum Content: This course involves in-depth study of beliefs, teachings, and practices of two major world religions (e.g., Christianity and Islam), and thematic studies in Philosophy and Ethics, including relationships, life's origins, existence of God, peace/conflict, and crime/punishment. It encourages critical thinking and reasoned arguments.
- Alignment with Bessie's Profile:
  - Strengths: Bessie enjoys debate and discussion, which is a core skill developed in this subject. She finds the topic of crime and punishment "really interesting". There are content similarities with History, which she likes.
  - Learning Needs: This subject requires significant literacy skills and extended written answers. Given her struggles with writing and her anxiety about speaking in front of people, she would need support for both written assessments and classroom discussions. Opportunities to prepare answers with a peer or adult before verbally giving them could be beneficial. The curriculum might need to be broken down into manageable chunks to aid her processing and concentration given the complex philosophical and ethical concepts.

To further enhance Bessie's learning experience, it would be valuable to implement a comprehensive support checklist for teachers, ensuring consistent application of her IEP strategies across all subjects, focusing on printed materials, laptop use, and task chunking, and to explicitly praise her effort and progress in overcoming challenges, especially in areas of difficulty.

The school's current assessment practices are criticized for not effectively checking "what pupils know and understand as they progress," leading to a failure to "identify the gaps or misconceptions". This means Bessie is repeating mistakes instead of correcting them and struggles to commit knowledge to long-term memory. Without understanding *where* she is going wrong or *what* she needs to do differently, she cannot effectively adapt her learning strategies, which is critical for a student with ADHD who learns best through structured, chunked, and feedback-rich methods.

## Understanding The "I Don't Understand Any of It" Reaction

- "When you say 'I don't understand any of it' in maths, what's the very first part that feels confusing to you, even if it's just a word or a symbol?" - *This aims to break down the overwhelming feeling into smaller, more manageable parts, a key strategy for Bessie's ADHD and dyslexia-related needs.*
- "If we imagine a maths lesson, at what point does the feeling of 'not understanding' usually start for you? Is it when the teacher explains, when you look at the questions, or when you try to start writing?" - *Pinpointing the trigger can help identify specific barriers.*
- "When that 'I don't understand' feeling comes, what does it *feel like* in your body or your mind?" *This helps connect the cognitive block to physical sensations of anxiety (e.g., "butterflies in the tummy," fast heart rate) and allows her to externalize the internal experience.*
- "Does that feeling of 'not understanding' sometimes make you feel like giving up before you even really start, or like it's too much effort to try? *This addresses potential task initiation difficulties or overwhelm, common with ADHD and anxiety, which can lead to withdrawal or defiance.*
- "Is it a feeling of your mind going completely blank, or more like too many thoughts rushing at once, making it hard to focus on one thing?" *This probes her working memory and processing challenges, which can manifest as either cognitive overload or an inability to retrieve information, impacting understanding.*
- "Does it feel like a sudden 'wall' goes up, or a gradual feeling of getting lost?" *This helps identify if the 'shut down' is immediate (perhaps an anxiety response) or a result of accumulating confusion (perhaps related to processing speed or missed foundational steps).*

### Delving Into Cognitive and Processing Barriers (specific to Her Learning profile)

- "When the teacher explains something new in maths, what's the easiest way for you to take that information in? Do you prefer listening, seeing diagrams, or having something printed to read?" *This acknowledges her need for multi-sensory input and preferences due to dyslexia and ADHD, such as visual learning and benefit from printed materials on blue paper.*
- "You've mentioned copying from the board is hard. When you're looking at a maths problem on the board, what specifically makes it difficult to even start writing it down or processing the numbers?" *This directly targets a known barrier for her and invites her to describe the specific visual or processing struggle.*
- "Do you find it hard to hold all the different steps of a multi-step maths problem in your head at once, or is it more about understanding each individual step?" *This addresses her working memory challenges and difficulty with sequencing, which are common in ADHD and dyslexia and can impact complex problem-solving.*

### Encouraging Problem-Solving and Agency

- "If you *could* wave a magic wand and change one thing about how maths is taught to make you understand, what would it be?" *This empowers her to identify ideal learning conditions without immediate constraints, fostering a problem-solving mindset.*
- "Are there any subjects where you *do* feel like you understand things well, even if they're challenging? What do those teachers or lessons do differently that helps you 'get it'?" *This leverages her strengths and positive learning experiences (e.g., her engagement in History when lessons are interactive and "no copying off the board"), to identify transferable strategies.*
- "If you knew for sure you wouldn't be blamed or embarrassed, what kind of help would you *really* want in that moment of not understanding?" *This directly addresses her anxiety about asking for help and the fear of negative reactions from teachers.*
- "What's one tiny thing you *could* try to do or ask for when that 'I don't understand' feeling hits, even if it feels really small?" *This promotes active coping and encourages her to break down the "asking for help" task into manageable steps, which is beneficial for her ADHD.*

To support Bessie in the classroom, teachers should implement the following specific strategies:

- **Provide printed materials or PowerPoints:** Bessie finds copying from the board difficult due to her dyslexia, so having materials provided in print would be beneficial.
- **Consistently use blue paper:** In subjects like history, the consistent provision of blue paper helps Bessie, and this practice should be applied across all subjects. This was also recommended by Forbes Opticians.
- **Vary teaching methods:** Bessie's engagement in lessons like history is highlighted as positive when the teacher uses varied methods. Teachers should adapt their teaching to accommodate her ADHD and avoid over-reliance on copying from the board.
- **Explain instructions clearly and repeat if necessary, without blame:** Instructions are often explained only once, and Bessie is blamed for not listening if she doesn't understand. Explanations should be repeated, and the focus should be on clarity, not just slowing down the speech.
- **Check for understanding:** The Ofsted report found that "teaching does not identify the gaps or misconceptions" in pupils' understanding, leading to repeated mistakes. Teachers need to have a built-in mechanism to check for understanding and address misconceptions.
- **Provide specific feedback on how to correct mistakes:** Bessie completes work but doesn't fully understand why her answer was wrong or how to improve, leading to repeated mistakes.
- **Ensure support staff focus on Bessie when present:** While support staff are present, they often focus on other students.
- **Avoid general whole class 'threats' related to not finishing work:** This is damaging for Bessie, as her inability to finish on time is not due to laziness but processing difficulties, and taking away her playtime can be demoralizing.
- **Do not ask higher-ability children to help Bessie if they get frustrated:** This can lead to unhelpful or discouraging comments and does not help Bessie.

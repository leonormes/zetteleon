- Curriculum Content: Typically includes a Thematic Study (e.g., 'Crime & Punishment c-present' including 'Whitechapel c-1900'), a British Depth Study (e.g., 'Early Elizabethan England'), a Period Study (e.g., 'Superpower relations and The Cold War'), and a Modern Depth Study (e.g., 'Weimar and Nazi Germany'). It develops skills in analyzing historical sources, understanding interpretations, and constructing arguments.
- Alignment with Bessie's Profile:
  - Strengths: History is one of Bessie's favorite subjects, and she reportedly feels engaged when the teacher uses varied methods, music, and videos, avoiding direct copying from the board. She has shown the ability to learn and remember content for History, even giving a presentation on her own. This directly aligns with her interest and can leverage her ability to focus when interested.
  - Learning Needs: Despite her interest, Bessie still requires consistent provision of blue paper and printed materials, which her History teacher is noted for trying to provide. Her verbal abilities are a strong asset for the analytical and argumentative aspects of the course.

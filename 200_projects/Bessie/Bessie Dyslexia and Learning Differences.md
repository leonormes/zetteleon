## Character Development Connection

Learning differences can be reframed as alternative processing strengths from the [[Character and Virtue MOC]]:

**[[VIA Virtue of Wisdom]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Wisdom|Perspective]]**: Different ways of processing information can lead to unique insights
- **[[VIA Virtue of Wisdom|Creativity]]**: Dyslexic thinking often involves creative problem-solving approaches

**[[VIA Virtue of Courage]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Perseverance (Persistence)]]**: Daily navigation of learning challenges builds resilience
- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Bravery]]**: Continuing to engage with learning despite difficulties

**[[VIA Virtue of Temperance]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Temperance|Self-Regulation (Self-Control)]]**: Developing strategies to manage learning challenges

Understanding dyslexia as a different way of processing information, not a deficit, helps identify compensatory strengths and alternative pathways to learning.

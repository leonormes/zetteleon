## **Subject Overview**

- **Qualification:** GCSE (9-1) Religious Studies (Specification A) 12
- **Exam Board:** AQA 12
- **Key Topics:** The course is divided into two components. Bessie's focus on "Philosophy and Ethics" suggests her school will follow the non-Textual studies route.
  - **Component 1: The study of religions: beliefs, teachings and practices:** Students study two major world religions in depth. The most common combination in UK schools is Christianity and Islam. For each, they study key beliefs (e.g., the nature of God, life after death), teachings, and practices (e.g., worship, festivals, rituals).12
  - **Component 2: Thematic studies:** Students study four themes from a choice of six. These themes explore religious, philosophical, and ethical issues from the perspective of the two religions studied and from non-religious viewpoints. The themes include: Relationships and families; Religion and life; The existence of God and revelation; Religion, peace and conflict; Religion, crime and punishment; and Religion, human rights and social justice.12
- **Assessment:** The course is 100% assessed by two written examinations.
  - **Paper 1: The study of religions (50%):** A 1-hour 45-minute exam. It contains structured questions on the two chosen religions.12
  - **Paper 2: Thematic studies (50%):** A 1-hour 45-minute exam. It contains structured questions on the four chosen ethical themes.12
  - Both papers include a mix of short-answer (1, 2, 4, 5 marks) and extended-writing (12 marks) questions. Spelling, punctuation, and grammar (SPaG) are also assessed.12

## **Tailored Learning & Study Recommendations for Bessie**

This subject is an excellent fit for Bessie's inquisitive, caring, and thoughtful nature. Her strength in discussion and debate will be a major asset. The challenge lies in remembering specific religious terminology and sacred text references, and in structuring the 12-mark evaluation questions.

- **Content Breakdown:** For each religion and theme, create a one-page "knowledge organiser" (on blue paper) that summarises the key concepts, key terms, and relevant quotes. This chunks the information into a manageable format. For the 12-mark questions, provide a clear, scaffolded structure: 'Point, Evidence, Explain, Link' for the main body paragraphs, and a separate structure for the evaluation.
- **Engagement & Focus:** The thematic studies are highly relevant to modern life and can be linked to current events, films, and documentaries to maintain interest. The "Religion, peace and conflict" theme can be explored through historical events she is studying in History. The "Religion and life" theme, which often covers animal rights and stewardship, connects directly to her love of animals and her caring nature.
- **Resource Adaptation:** Use digital flashcards (e.g., Quizlet) with images to learn key terminology (e.g., a picture of a church for 'place of worship'). All notes and essays must be typed on her laptop. Use audio versions of key religious texts or documentary voiceovers to present information in an accessible format, reducing the reading load.4
- **Active Learning Techniques:** This subject is made for debate. Organise formal class debates on the ethical issues from Component 2\. This allows Bessie to use her verbal skills to explore and consolidate her understanding before writing.1 She can create "empathy maps" for different viewpoints on an ethical issue, considering what different people might think, feel, say, and do. This taps into her caring and thoughtful qualities.
- **Practice & Reinforcement:** Key quotes are often required. Instead of just memorising them, she should write them on flashcards and explain in her own words what they mean and how they could be used in an essay. For the 12-mark questions, practice writing just one side of the argument first, then the other, before combining them into a full answer. This breaks the task down and builds confidence.
- **Anxiety Management:** The structured nature of the exam questions (always following the same 1, 2, 4, 5, 12 mark pattern) makes them predictable, which can reduce anxiety.12 Knowing the structure of the 12-mark essay in advance provides a safety net. Encourage her to talk through her ideas for an essay before writing, which can alleviate the anxiety of facing a blank page.
- **Leveraging Strengths:** Her strong verbal skills will shine in class discussions and debates, which is a core part of learning in this subject. Her inquisitive nature will drive her to explore the "big questions" in philosophy and ethics. Her caring nature will give her a deep and genuine insight into themes like social justice, human rights, and animal welfare.

The 'Plan' stage involves translating assessment insights into concrete, actionable strategies and outcomes.

Current Plan Components (Examples from IEP/Support Plan):

- Core Accommodations:
  - Guaranteed use of a laptop for all extended writing tasks in class, homework, and internal/external examinations.
  - Provision of all printed resources (handouts, worksheets, presentation slides) on blue paper.
  - Eligibility for 25% Extra Time in all timed examinations.
  - Access to a quiet space (sensory room/cubby) or well-being space for breaks or when feeling overwhelmed.
- Tailored Learning Strategies:
  - Breaking down large tasks into smaller, achievable chunks with clear deadlines.
  - Providing visual and verbal prompts for strategies, and pre-checking understanding before tasks.
  - Connecting learning directly to Bessie's passions and interests (e.g., special effects make-up in Art, horses in Photography, film analysis in Film Studies, animals in Biology, historical events linked to current interests).
  - Utilizing active learning techniques (e.g., creating response pieces in Art, photo walks in Photography, digital mind maps in Film Studies/History, retelling history verbally, physical models in Science).
  - Using the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes focused work, 5-minute break) for revision.
  - Scaffolding writing tasks with clear structures and sentence starters.
- Anxiety Management: Opportunities to talk about worries.
- Outcomes/Targets (from Oct 2024 Review):
  1. Develop answers with alternative interpretations and read out loud.
  2. Continue to push her boundaries through attempting stretch and challenge tasks.
  3. Continue to ensure homework is submitted on time and to standard.
  4. Practice multiplication and division with powers of 10, especially those involving decimals.

Recommendation for Plan Development and Communication:

- Detailed Learning Passport: Create a student-friendly "Learning Passport" summarizing Bessie's key strategies and accommodations, to be shared with all subject teachers.
- Regular Staff Briefings: Reinforce Bessie's needs and strategies through regular staff briefings and emails, ensuring all staff are aware of and commit to implementing her IEP consistently.
- Proactive Material Provision: Teachers should proactively provide printed materials and PowerPoints, eliminating the need for Bessie to copy from the board.

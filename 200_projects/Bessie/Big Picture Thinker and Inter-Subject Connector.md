Bessie demonstrates exceptional ability to see connections between different subjects and concepts, thinking in broad, interconnected ways rather than in isolated silos. This strength should be leveraged in her learning approach.

## Evidence-Based Strategies for Cross-Curricular Thinking

### Retrieval Practice Across Contexts

- [[Learn Like a Pro]] - "The more you retrieve the material, and the broader the set of contexts you retrieve the materials in, the stronger and more broadly connected the neural links become"

### Interleaving for Connection Building

- [[Learn Like a Pro]] - "Interleaving helps you not only learn the concepts you're studying, but also understand the differences between them... varying or mixing different concepts"

### External Brain for Pattern Recognition

- [[I learned a system for remembering everything]] - Creating note card systems organized by theme to identify cross-subject patterns and connections

### ADHD Default Mode Network Benefits

- [[Adhd 2.0]] - "It is in the DMN mode that you can daydream... or make interesting connections between concepts (helpful when appreciating riddles or jokes or solving crossword puzzles, or coming up with the Next Big...)"

## Character Development Connection

This big-picture thinking ability connects to several character strengths from the [[Character and Virtue MOC]]:

**[[VIA Virtue of Wisdom]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Wisdom|Perspective]]**: Being able to provide wise counsel to others; having ways of looking at the world that make sense to oneself and others
- **[[VIA Virtue of Wisdom|Judgement (Critical Thinking)]]**: Thinking things through and examining them from all sides; not jumping to conclusions

**[[VIA Virtue of Transcendence]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Transcendence|Spirituality (Faith, Purpose)]]**: Having coherent beliefs about the higher purpose and meaning of the universe and one's place within it

Her ability to see connections across disciplines reflects a mature capacity for synthesis and meaning-making that extends beyond academic performance into character development.

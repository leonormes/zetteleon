To provide a clear and manageable overview, the following table summarises the assessment structure for each of Bessie's subjects. This visual format helps to break down the components of the GCSE courses, clarifying the balance between examinations and Non-Exam Assessment (NEA), often referred to as coursework. Understanding this structure from the outset can help in planning and managing workload throughout the two-year courses, which is a key strategy for reducing anxiety and supporting focus.2

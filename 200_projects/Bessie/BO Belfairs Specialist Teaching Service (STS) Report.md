Based on a review of the **BO Belfairs Specialist Teaching Service (STS) Report** and the timeline you provided, the progress since September has been a mixture of **successful engagement strategies** undermined by **inconsistent implementation** of the agreed support plan.

While the STS report confirms that Bessie is an "articulate and academically able student" who wants to do well, the practical application of her return-to-school plan has faced significant operational failures.

Here is an analysis of how the plan has progressed since September:

## 1. Timeline of Progress and Setbacks

Since the Specialist Teaching Service became involved on September 18th, the trajectory has moved from home support to attempted school reintegration, but it has been "stop-start" due to external triggers.

-   **September (Weeks 1 & 2) - Stabilization:** The initial phase was successful. Bessie engaged well with Lauren (STS) during home visits three times a week. This built the necessary trust to attempt entering the school building.
-   **October (Weeks 3 & 4) - Academic Reintegration Attempts:** Bessie began attending History lessons. However, this immediately highlighted the **Cognitive and Learning Barriers** identified in the STS report.
    -   **Week 3:** The Individual Education Plan (IEP) was not followed (e.g., specific resources/blue paper not provided).
    -   **Week 4:** The seating plan—a known trigger for Bessie's anxiety regarding safety—was changed without reason. The STS report explicitly states that where she sits impacts her "sense of safety and emotional readiness".
-   **November (Weeks 5 & 6) - Social and Regulation Focus:**
    -   **Highs:** Bessie had a "Greta day" (likely 'Great day') on Wednesday and was "absolutely buzzing" to do Art on Thursday. This validates the STS assessment that Art is a key regulation tool for her.
    -   **Lows:** The "Hair Conflict." Despite Ms Rowland (AHT) agreeing she could tuck her hair back, Mr Williams (DHT) and office staff insisted she put it up in an elastic band, causing her to "kick off". This directly contravenes the plan’s requirement to avoid "changes made to my day with no advance notice" and to speak to her in a "relational manner".

## 2. Assessment of the Plan's Components

**What is Working (Strengths):**
-   **Identified Regulation Strategies:** The plan has successfully identified what works. The STS report notes that Art, listening to music, and accessing 'Compass' or the 'Cubbie' effectively help Bessie regulate. The timeline confirms she responds well when these are accessible.
-   **Trusted Adults:** Bessie has formed a connection with Lauren and Mr Higginson (Head of Year). The STS report notes she identifies him as a trusted adult, and she was "fine" on Tuesday when with him.

**What is Failing (Barriers):**
-   **Inconsistency of "Universal Strategies":** The STS report recommends that "Teachers must read and follow Bessie’s IEP" regarding blue paper and chunking lessons. Your timeline suggests this is "proving difficult at times" and is not happening consistently across subjects.
-   **Communication of Expectations:** The plan states clearly that staff should "speak to me in a relational manner" and avoid raising voices. The conflict over the hair indicates that not all staff (particularly those outside the SEN core team, like office staff or senior leadership) are adhering to the *spirit* of the support plan, prioritising uniform policy over her regulation needs.
-   **Resource Availability:** Parents expressed concern that the "goal posts have been changed" regarding Lauren's availability, fearing she won't be there as much as originally promised.

## 3. Summary of STS Findings

The STS report provides a professional validation of your observations as parents. It confirms:

-   **The "Masking" Phenomenon:** It acknowledges the contrast between the calm child at home and the distressed behaviours at school, attributed to masking her neurodivergent traits.
-   **The Root of Dysregulation:** It formally documents that Bessie’s "behaviour may escalate towards adults" as a signal of struggle, rather than "naughtiness".
-   **The Need for Predictability:** It states that "It is important to communicate any changes to Bessie’s day in advance". The hair incident was a failure of this specific protocol.

## Conclusion

Progress since September has been **fragile**. While the *content* of the plan (using Art, Philosophy, and key adults) is sound and supported by the STS assessment, the **execution** is currently failing Bessie because the wider school environment (office staff, subject teachers, senior leaders) is not consistently following the agreed protocols regarding uniform flexibility, seating, and communication styles. The plan is working when the core SEN team controls the environment, but breaking down when Bessie faces the wider school system.

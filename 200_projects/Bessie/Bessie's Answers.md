## Summary of Discussion with Bessie ('Lessons' Transcript)

Bessie's conversation revealed several key aspects of her school experience, highlighting both her interests and significant challenges:

1. **Enjoyment and Engagement**: Bessie enjoys the social aspect of school and finds History her most interesting subject. She recalled a history lesson from the previous year that was particularly engaging due to interactive activities, background music, and videos, noting that there was "no copying off the board".
2. **Concentration Difficulties**: She struggles to concentrate and stay on task in "all" other subjects, attributing this to "boringness" or if the lesson isn't taught in an engaging way. She loses focus quickly when the teaching method is uninteresting.
3. **IEP Awareness**: Bessie is aware of her IEP (Individual Education Plan) and understands it is supposed to guide teachers to provide consistent support across all lessons.
4. **Implementation of IEP Strategies - Academic**:
   - **Extra Time**: She does not receive extra time to think or complete large tasks.
   - **Breaking Down Tasks**: Teachers sometimes break down large tasks, but only for new concepts, not for previously learned material, expecting her to remember from before.
   - **Copying from Board**: Teachers hand-write notes on the big whiteboard, and Bessie does not receive printed materials, keywords, or the long date directly in front of her. She finds computer-printed text on the screen easiest to read.
   - **Laptop Use**: She is allowed to ask for a laptop for longer writing tasks and tests, but teachers sometimes "don't make me do it," even though they are "supposed to".
   - **Blue Paper/Books**: She has blue books/paper for English, Math, Science, and History, but notes she is "supposed to have them for everything".
   - **Spelling/Forgetting**: When she struggles with spelling or forgets something, some teachers yell at her or tell her to "get out." Other teachers, like Mr. Gordon or a "helper teacher," provide one-to-one explanations, which helps her understand. Specific teachers mentioned for negative responses include Mr. Concannon, Miss Amador, Mr. Adolfo, and Miss Linaka.
   - **Visual Cues/Strategies**: Teachers do not provide visual cues, reminders, or strategies like self-talk or visual links in learning.
5. **Implementation of IEP Strategies - Emotional/Social**:
   - **Praise**: Teachers do not praise her for trying hard or for using strategies; praise is typically only given for getting the "right answer".
   - **Anxiety Support**: When feeling worried or overwhelmed, teachers offer a "five minutes out of class" pass to wellbeing. She states this is useful for "a little bit anxious" feelings but not for "proper like really anxious" moments because "no one talks to you" or guides her on how to calm down.
   - **Asking for Help/Mistakes**: She feels "kind of" comfortable asking teachers for help. Reactions to mistakes vary, sometimes being told she "weren't listening," and other times receiving helpful method-based guidance.
   - **Quieter Room Access**: She can use her time-out pass for a quieter room or sensory cubby with "certain teachers" but not all.
   - **Teacher Understanding**: Bessie feels her teachers "don't understand" what she needs when anxious and often just tell her to "behave a certain way".
6. **Feedback and Assessment**: Bessie feels she lacks opportunities to show what she knows in different ways beyond writing or speaking in front of the class. She has to "guess" how well she is doing in subjects like maths because she is "never told".

## Cross-Referencing with Bessie's IEP and Support Documents

Bessie's statements reveal significant discrepancies between the documented support strategies and their actual implementation, as well as a clear impact of her ADHD and anxiety on her school experience.

However, Bessie reported significant difficulties concentrating in "all" other lessons, which she attributes to a lack of engagement and "boringness" in how the material is presented. She stated she loses focus quickly if a subject isn't taught in an interesting way.

Regarding her Individual Education Plan (IEP), Bessie understands it's meant to ensure consistent support across all her subjects. However, she highlighted several areas where the implementation falls short:

- **Extra Time**: She does not consistently receive extra time to think or complete large tasks.
- **Task Breakdown**: While tasks are sometimes broken down for new concepts, this support is not provided for previously learned material, where teachers expect her to recall information.
- **Note-Taking**: Teachers hand-write notes on the board, and Bessie does not receive keywords, the long date, or printed materials to make copying easier. She finds computer-projected text clearest.
- **Laptop Use**: She can request a laptop for longer writing tasks and tests, but noted teachers "don't make me do it" even though they "are supposed to".
- **Blue Paper/Books**: While she has blue books/paper in English, Math, Science, and History, she believes she "supposed to have them for everything".
- **Support for Spelling/Forgetting**: Her experience varies widely; some teachers resort to yelling or telling her to "get out" when she struggles, while others (like Mr. Gordon or a helper teacher) provide helpful one-to-one explanations. She explicitly named Mr. Concannon, Miss Amador, Mr. Adolfo, and Miss Linaka as teachers who tell her to "get out".
- **Visual Cues**: She confirmed that teachers do not give her visual cues, reminders, or strategies like self-talk or visual links.
- **Praise**: She feels teachers do not praise her for effort or for using strategies, only for getting the right answers.
- **Anxiety Support**: When overwhelmed, she is allowed five minutes in the wellbeing room, which helps with mild anxiety but is insufficient for "proper," severe anxiety, as no one talks to her or guides her to calm down.
- **Asking for Help**: She "kind of" feels comfortable asking for help, but responses to mistakes vary, sometimes attributing it to her not listening.
- **Quieter Room Access**: She can use her time-out pass for a quieter room or sensory cubby, but only with "certain teachers".
- **Teacher Understanding**: Bessie believes her teachers "don't understand" her needs when she's anxious and instead tell her to "behave a certain way".
- **Assessment & Feedback**: She feels she lacks opportunities to demonstrate her knowledge in diverse ways. She also "guess[es]" her performance in subjects like maths because she is "never told" how well she's doing.

Overall, Bessie's account paints a picture of a student who is engaged when learning is tailored to her needs but struggles significantly when it is not, and whose documented support needs are not being consistently met across all her classes.

## Cross-Referencing Bessie's Responses with Her IEP

Bessie's IEP, primarily outlined in her "Learning Profile October 2024", along with details from her "Educational Psychologist's Report July 2019" and "July 2020 - Reviewed and Updated.pdf", aims to address her learning and emotional needs. Her feedback highlights several gaps in implementation.

| **Academic challenges**                     | Bessie struggles with difficulties in concentrating on tasks not of her interest and is often forgetful. She has struggled to develop reading skills but has responded well to high levels of intervention. She needs support to transfer phonics skills into reading. The EP report recommended presenting information in small chunks, scaffolding longer tasks, and using a reading window. Her Learning Profile states she finds it very difficult to copy large chunks of information from the board. She has a learning need for SPLD and an ADHD diagnosis. Her KS2 Maths Scaled Score was 91, and CAT Quantitative was 78, indicating a difficulty in Maths.                                           | Bessie finds all lessons difficult if they are "boring" or not engaging, losing focus quickly. She feels teachers yell at her or tell her to "get out" when she struggles with spelling or forgets things, instead of providing one-to-one help. She states that tasks are broken down only once for new concepts, not for review. She does not get keywords or printed materials when copying from the board. She is not consistently given extra time for tasks. She finds out how well she's doing in subjects by "guessing". | **Discrepancy:** Despite documented needs for adapted information delivery, repeated support, and specific feedback mechanisms, Bessie reports a lack of consistent implementation and punitive responses from some teachers when she struggles. Her difficulty with copying from the board is exacerbated by the lack of printed materials. Her low Quantitative CAT score aligns with her reported struggles in Maths and the lack of proper feedback. |
| **Use of Technology/Aids**                  | The EP report noted Bessie struggled with fine motor skills like buttons but could do shoelaces; she prefers hands for feeding but can use cutlery. The Occupational Therapy recommendations specifically suggested Stabilo Easyoriginal pens/pencils and pen grips for more comfortable grasp. Her Learning Profile states she needs a laptop for longer writing tasks and summative tests, and that she needs resources printed on blue paper and blue paper books due to Mearles Irlen syndrome.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Bessie states she can ask for a laptop, but teachers "don't make me do it" even when they "are supposed to". She has blue books/paper in English, Math, Science, and History, but not "for everything" as she is "supposed to".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Partial Implementation/Discrepancy:** While some accommodations (blue paper in some subjects, laptop availability if requested) are in place, they are not consistently implemented or actively encouraged as needed. The OT recommendations for specific writing aids are not mentioned in her current profile.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Emotional/Anxiety Support**               | Mother reports Bessie can get very anxious occasionally, mainly in school situations, but it is currently manageable. The EP report noted Bessie has lots of worries and doesn't like change; she worries about others doing well and doesn't ask for help if stuck. It recommended teaching calming strategies (e.g., breathing techniques). Her Learning Profile includes "opportunities to talk about Any worries" as a support strategy. Bessie has been referred for school counseling and attended her first session. The ADHD report also recommended accessing local support groups and national resources for parents and carers. She has a time-out pass for a quieter room or sensory room's cubby. | Bessie states that when she feels worried or overwhelmed, teachers offer "five minutes out of class" in wellbeing. She finds this only works for "a little bit anxious" feelings, not "really anxious," because "no one talks to you" or guides her to calm down. She can use her time-out pass for a quieter room with "certain teachers" but not all. She feels teachers "don't understand" her anxiety and just tell her to "behave a certain way".                                                                           | **Discrepancy:** The fundamental need for supportive dialogue and guidance during anxious moments, despite being a stated support strategy, is reportedly not being met. The time-out pass is inconsistently applied, and Bessie feels a lack of understanding from teachers regarding her anxiety. The EP report recommended direct calming strategies, which Bessie indicates are not provided in the time-out setting.                                |
| **Feedback & Confidence Building**          | The EP report recommended opportunities to succeed, praise for effort, and support to develop confidence and a growth mindset. Her 2020 profile aimed for her to be "confident in my abilities and can concentrate on my strengths" and to "identify where I have been successful using a green comment". The review in October 2024 notes "confidence is growing, there is still room for more" and "general feedback is that Bessie is working hard and improving across the curriculum".                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Bessie states teachers do not praise her for trying hard or for using strategies, only for getting the "right answer". She doesn't feel opportunities exist to show what she knows in different ways. She has to "guess" how well she's doing in subjects because she's "never told".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Discrepancy:** There is a clear disconnect between the documented goal of building confidence through effort-based praise and varied assessment, and Bessie's reported experience of only outcome-based praise and a lack of clear performance feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Overall Findings:** Bessie's self-report indicates that while some elements of her IEP and support plans are in place (e.g., blue paper in some subjects, laptop available if requested, time-out pass), the *quality and consistency* of their implementation, particularly in areas critical to her ADHD and anxiety management, are lacking. There's a notable absence of understanding and tailored support from many teachers, leading to punitive responses (yelling, removal from class) rather than guidance, and a failure to provide the type of positive reinforcement and feedback that would foster a growth mindset and confidence. This inconsistency creates an environment where Bessie's concentration difficulties and anxiety are exacerbated, rather than mitigated. The school's overall assessment of her improvement is not fully aligned with Bessie's internal experience.

**Next Steps:** Given these findings, it would be beneficial to:

1. **Request a formal IEP review meeting** specifically to discuss the observed discrepancies between documented strategies and daily classroom experience, leveraging Bessie's direct feedback from your conversation.
2. **Propose specific teacher training or a detailed briefing session** for all her teachers on Bessie's IEP, focusing on practical implementation strategies for ADHD and anxiety in girls, and the importance of effort-based praise and varied assessment methods.
3. **Explore alternative communication methods** between Bessie and her teachers regarding her needs, perhaps a non-verbal cue system for when she's overwhelmed, given her reported difficulty speaking up in class.

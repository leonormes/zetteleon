Bessie has a good attitude towards trying tasks and "giving it a go," even when she anticipates difficulty. She tries and wants to do well.

She responds well to praise for effort and strategies, not just for correct answers.

## Character Development Connection

This positive attitude toward effort reflects several character strengths from the [[Character and Virtue MOC]]:

**[[VIA Virtue of Courage]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Bravery]]**: Not shrinking from threat, challenge, difficulty, or pain; speaking up for what is right
- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Perseverance (Persistence)]]**: Finishing what one starts; persisting in a course of action despite obstacles
- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Zest (Vitality)]]**: Approaching life with excitement and energy; living life as an adventure

**[[VIA Virtue of Transcendence]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Transcendence|Hope (Optimism)]]**: Expecting the best in the future and working to achieve it

Her willingness to attempt challenging tasks demonstrates courage and optimism that can be nurtured into mature character virtues through consistent encouragement and growth mindset approaches.

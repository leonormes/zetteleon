- Curriculum Content: This course focuses on developing critical reading of diverse texts from the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, enabling students to interpret information, analyze language and structure, and compare ideas. Writing skills are developed for creative (descriptions, narratives) and transactional purposes (arguing, persuading, advising). Spoken language is assessed separately, focusing on clear presentation and effective use of Standard English.
- Alignment with Bessie's Profile:
  - Strengths: Bessie has highly developed verbal abilities and may enjoy creative writing, discussion, and debate. The emphasis on language analysis and creative writing could align with her imaginative nature and provide an outlet for expression. Her KS2 Reading Test scaled score of 105 suggests strong reading comprehension, which is a core outcome of this subject.
  - Learning Needs: The course requires extensive reading and writing. Bessie struggles with reading speed, writing, and copying large chunks of information from the board due to her dyslexia and phonological working memory issues. She will benefit significantly from printed materials, especially on blue paper, and using a laptop for longer writing tasks. Teachers providing "key words or the long date already written down" could help her with copying tasks. Extra time for processing information will also be beneficial.

4. Do your teachers give you extra time to think about answers or to complete tasks, especially big ones? Do they break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable parts for you? [6, 7]
5. When you're copying notes from the board, do teachers provide key words or the long date on a whiteboard right in front of you, or give you printed materials, so it's easier to copy? [7-9]
6. Are you able to use your laptop for longer writing tasks and tests in all your subjects? [8, 10]
7. Do you get your printed materials on blue paper, and do you have blue paper books, as recommended? [8, 10]
8. How do teachers help you when you're struggling with spelling, or if you forget something you just learned? [8]
9. Do teachers give you visual cues or reminders of strategies you can use if you get stuck, like self-talk or making visual links in learning? [6, 9, 11]
10. Do you feel like you have opportunities to work on tasks by yourself and feel successful, even if they're challenging? [8, 11]
11. How do teachers praise you? Do they tell you "well done" for trying hard and for using strategies, not just for getting the right answer? [12-16]

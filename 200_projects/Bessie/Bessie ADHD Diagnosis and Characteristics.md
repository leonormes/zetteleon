**[[VIA Virtue of Courage]]:**

- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Zest (Vitality)]]**: High energy and enthusiasm when engaged
- **[[VIA Virtue of Courage|Perseverance (Persistence)]]**: Ability to hyperfocus on areas of interest

Understanding ADHD as neurodivergence rather than deficit helps identify how these traits can become character strengths with proper support.

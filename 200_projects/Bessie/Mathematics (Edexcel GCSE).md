- Curriculum Content: The course covers six main attainment targets:
  - Number,
  - Algebra,
  - Ratio,
  - Proportion and Rates of Change,
  - Geometry and Measures,
  - Probability, and
  - Statistics.
- Assessment is by examination.
- Alignment with Bessie's Profile:
  - Strengths: Bessie has a good attitude towards trying tasks and is willing to 'give it a go'. If provided with engaging and interactive teaching, she can find topics interesting and focus well.
  - Learning Needs: Maths is identified as an area of difficulty for Bessie. Her KS2 Maths scaled score was 91, and her CAT Quantitative score was 78, indicating a significant weakness in quantitative reasoning. She struggles with multiplication and division with powers of 10. She reports that many Maths lessons involve extensive copying from the board, which she finds very difficult and ineffective. She needs tasks broken down into manageable chunks, especially if she's learned them once before and is expected to remember. Consistent use of printed materials and blue paper could alleviate the copying burden.

To assess how consistently Bessie's teachers are implementing her support, drawing on her Individualized Education Program (IEP), Individual Support Plan (ISP), and related reports, here is a set of comprehensive questions you can ask Bessie. These questions aim to understand her day-to-day experience and the practical application of her support strategies:

**I. General Understanding and Communication of Support**

1. Do you know what your Individualized Education Program (IEP) or Individual Support Plan (ISP) is, and what kind of support it says you should get at school [1-4]?
2. Do your teachers talk to you about your support plan? How often do they mention it, and does it feel helpful when they do [5]?
3. Do all your teachers seem to know about your support plan and the strategies that help you best [5-7]?

**II. Specific Classroom Support Implementation**

1. **Processing Information & Task Management:**
   - When teachers give instructions or new information, do they give you extra time to process it [8, 9]?
   - Are large tasks, like projects or assignments, usually broken down into smaller, more achievable chunks for you [8, 9]?
   - Do teachers provide visual reminders or verbal cues to help you remember strategies to use when you're working [8, 10]? Can you give an example of one that helps?
   - Do teachers prompt you to stay focused and on task if you get distracted [11]?
   - Since you find it difficult to copy large chunks from the board [11], do your teachers provide key words or things like the long date already written down for you to copy [12, 13]? How often do you get that help?
   - Before you start a task, do your teachers check to make sure you fully understand what you need to do [13]?
   - Do you get simple tasks to do by yourself that are then checked, to help you feel successful and confident [10, 11, 13]?

2. **Academic Tool & Material Use:**
   - Are you able to easily use your school laptop for longer writing tasks and summative tests [4, 11]? Do all your teachers allow this without you having to ask a lot?
   - Are your resources and books printed on blue paper, as advised [4, 11]? Do you always get this, or sometimes have to ask?
   - Do you have a visual timetable or a "now and next" board that helps you stay organized [14]? Is it used consistently?
   - Are you able to use "look, cover, write, check" strategies when you're learning [14]? Do your teachers remind you to use them?

3. **Reading and Math Support:**
   - Do you get regular opportunities to read in school [13]? When you do, is it often paired reading with an adult or peer [10, 15]? Does that help take the pressure off you [10]?
   - Are your teachers helping you practice multiplication and division with powers of 10, especially those involving decimals [8, 16]? What about your 2, 3, 5, and 10 times tables [17]?

**III. Emotional and Anxiety Management Support**

1. **Worry and Anxiety:**
   - Do you feel you have opportunities to talk about any worries you have with teachers or other staff at school [11]?
   - When you're worried, do teachers allow you thinking time before answering questions [9]? Do you get a chance to prepare answers with a peer or adult if that helps [9]?
   - Have teachers or other staff helped you learn or practice calming strategies, like breathing techniques, when you feel anxious [18]?
   - Do teachers help you feel okay with uncertainty [19]? Do they help you focus on something else if you're getting anxious about physical symptoms [20]?

2. **Sensory and Overwhelm Management:**
   - When the classroom or school environment feels too noisy or overwhelming, do you feel comfortable using your time-out pass to go to a quieter room or the sensory room's cubby [4]? Is this always available when you need it?
   - How do teachers manage the environment to help you concentrate, especially with all the noise [4]?

3. **Social Interactions & Asking for Help:**
   - Do teachers give you opportunities to give answers privately instead of in front of the whole class if that makes you more comfortable [6]?
   - Do you feel comfortable asking teachers for help if you are stuck or confused [17, 21]? What happens when you do?
   - Do teachers help you with strategies for friendships or social situations if you struggle at times [22]?

**IV. Progress and Feedback**

1. **Effort and Success:**
   - Do your teachers praise your effort and the strategies you use, not just if you get things "right" [23-25]? Does this help you feel good about trying, even if you make mistakes?
   - Do teachers encourage you to try "stretch and challenge" tasks [8, 17]? How do they make you feel about pushing your boundaries?
   - Are you able to identify where you've been successful using a "green comment," as mentioned in your targets [14]? Do your teachers use this system with you?

2. **Homework:**
   - Do you feel you're getting the support you need to ensure your homework is submitted on time and to the right standard [8, 17]? What happens if it's late?

3. **Your Voice in Planning:**
   - Do you feel your opinions and feelings are included when staff review your progress or plan new goals for your support [26]?

**V. Overall Impression**

1. Overall, do you feel that your teachers understand your needs well?
2. Do you feel the support you are getting is consistent across all your lessons and with all your teachers? Are there some teachers who are better at it than others?
3. Is there anything else you think your teachers could do to help you feel more comfortable and successful at school?

This set of questions should provide a comprehensive picture of Bessie's experience with the implementation of her support. Once you have her responses, you can compare them with the documented support strategies and identify any gaps or inconsistencies.

For your next step, you might consider using Bessie's responses to draft specific follow-up questions for the school's SENCO or individual teachers, asking them about *their* perspective on implementing these strategies. This can help identify potential communication gaps or areas where teachers might need additional training or resources.

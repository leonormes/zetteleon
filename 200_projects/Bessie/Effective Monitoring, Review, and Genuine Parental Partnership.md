- Failing Identified: The October 2024 review stated "Parent's views - none available at time of review", a direct failure of the school's stated objective to "Support a partnership with parents/carers, valuing their views and contributions and keeping them fully involved". Ofsted also noted the school "has not thought enough about how to check what pupils know and understand". Bessie herself "has to guess" how well she's doing.
- What to Ask the School to DO:
  - Proactive Parental Engagement: Establish a clear, proactive schedule for seeking and incorporating your views into all reviews and planning for Bessie, ensuring you are treated as a valued partner.
  - Transparent Progress Monitoring: Implement clear, regular, and purposeful assessment methods in all subjects that accurately identify Bessie's learning gaps and misconceptions as they arise, and track her progress effectively.
  - Student Voice Integration: Ensure Bessie's views and preferences are actively sought and genuinely incorporated into decisions about her support and goals.
- What to Ask the School to PROVE:
  - Evidence of Parental Consultation: Show documented evidence of attempts to solicit and include your input for all future reviews, not just a missed opportunity. This could include meeting invitations, pre-meeting questionnaires, and signed minutes that record your contributions.
  - Bessie's Progress Data: Provide regular, detailed reports on Bessie's academic progress across all subjects, highlighting identified gaps, specific interventions used to address them, and evidence of whether these interventions are effective.
  - Review Meeting Minutes: Supply copies of minutes from Bessie's SEND review meetings that clearly document agreed-upon actions, responsible staff, and timelines, with follow-up on previous actions.

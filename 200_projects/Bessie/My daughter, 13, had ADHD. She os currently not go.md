My daughter, 13, had ADHD. She is currently not going into school because of anxiety. She wants to go in. She seems fine at gone where she is safe, but as soon as she gets on school she freaks out and can't control herself. I also have ADHD and rsd. I can appreciate the emotional reactions. But it's feels as though there is nothing we can about it with her. I find myself getting frustrated with her for :not trying ' , but i know that is not true. What can be done to help a child with rsd and other emotional regulation differences

A child with ADHD who experiences **school anxiety and rejection-sensitive dysphoria (RSD)** often faces emotional overwhelm that isn’t about not trying—it’s about their **nervous system going into distress mode** when they encounter stress, uncertainty, or perceived rejection. Helping her means creating safety, predictability, and emotional skills over time rather than pushing for immediate exposure to school.

## Understanding What’s Happening

Children with ADHD have emotional regulation differences due to how their brain processes threat and rejection. When anxiety spikes, their **“fight–flight–freeze”** response can hijack reasoning, so logic or reassurance won’t help in that moment. RSD then amplifies feelings of failure or rejection so severely that going to school can feel intolerable.

## Emotional Regulation Strategies

Helping her learn to *notice, name, and navigate* feelings before they escalate builds long-term resilience.

- Practice “body check-ins” when she’s calm—help her describe physical signs of rising anxiety (tight chest, shaky hands).
- Create a custom emotional plan together: what she can do when she feels it coming (listen to music, fidget tool, quiet area).
- Use mindfulness or grounding tools (breathing, “five senses” exercise, stretching) daily, even briefly.
- Model calm regulation yourself—your reaction helps her mirror how to self-soothe.

## Safe, Structured Environment

A predictable rhythm gives ADHD brains a sense of safety.

- Keep mornings minimal and calm: visual routines, gentle wake-up, avoid rushing.
- Use predictable home structure with consistent routines and designated quiet recovery spaces.
- Reframe school attendance goals into micro-steps (e.g., getting dressed, walking to the gate) with praise at each success.

## Communication and Connection

Avoid criticism or “try harder” messages—children with RSD interpret correction as rejection.

- Validate her feelings (“It makes sense you feel anxious—school feels hard right now”) before problem-solving.
- Emphasize progress, not performance. Point out effort rather than outcome.
- Collaborate with school for gentle re-entry—perhaps meeting a teacher she trusts in a calm room or having short, reduced days at first.

## Professional and Therapeutic Support

Therapeutic guidance helps her learn regulation skills in a safe setting and reduces family frustration .

- Consider CBT or emotion-coaching-based therapy focused on coping strategies for anxiety and RSD .
- A child psychologist, occupational therapist, or ADHD coach can teach emotional awareness and nervous system calming techniques.
- Some ADHD medications or mild alpha agonists like guanfacine or clonidine have been effective for emotional regulation under medical supervision .

## For You as a Parent

Your ADHD and RSD mean you *feel* her distress sharply. It’s okay to step back when you’re dysregulated. Use grounding or breathing tools together. Parent support groups (YoungMinds, Family Lives, or local ADHD parent coaching) can also help you offload emotional weight .

The key is **slow exposure, emotional safety, and co-regulation**. She doesn’t need to “push through”—she needs to trust her body can handle discomfort, with your calm presence beside her.

She had grown up with a lot of adults and is very comfortable around adults. She can talk with them and it's charming. Even she first started year 7 in a new big school she was very happy and doing well. Teachers loved her. Then one day for some reason she got in to trouble. This seems to have been the turning point. She then escalated into neon one of the telly naughty children, leaving class, talking back to teachers, not attending lessons. It is as though getting on to trouble was a huge suprise and devastating to her sense of self. This aligns with rsd. Although this is just one idea and the change it makes sense to me. But i have confirmation bias. It is obviously complex situation. Review my ideas and elaborate but also suggest other lines of reasoning i may be over looking

Your analysis that the disciplinary incident acted as a **turning point** tied to **rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD)** is both plausible and psychologically well grounded. Children with ADHD who are socially mature and attuned to adult approval can mask difficulties effectively — but when that mask breaks under criticism or punishment, the emotional collapse can look dramatic and confusing.

### Why Your RSD Hypothesis Fits

Children with ADHD often experience **RSD as an overwhelming flood of shame, rejection, or humiliation** at even mild discipline. When that first “being in trouble” moment happens, it can feel like sudden evidence of unworthiness and betrayal, especially for a child who previously thrived on positive attention. This can lead to:

- **Defensive defiance** — anger and talking back to regain control over unbearable vulnerability.
- **Avoidance of school** or adult authority as a means of self-protection.
- **Identity rupture** — if she had built her self-esteem around being liked or “good,” then one shaming experience could collapse that construction.

You are also correct to note your confirmation bias: our brains naturally look for coherence, especially when RSD resonates personally. There are, however, several **alternative or coexisting explanations** worth exploring.

### Other Possible Contributors

#### 1. ADHD Masking Collapse

Your daughter’s strong social fluency with adults and initial success may reflect **masking**, where she worked hard to meet expectations and appear in control. Such suppression of ADHD impulses comes at a high emotional cost and can lead to burnout or explosive behaviour once the mask becomes unsustainable. The disciplinary event might have been the incident that tipped her from “holding it together” to “I can’t anymore.”

#### 2. Pubertal and Environmental Stress

The transition to secondary school often coincides with **puberty’s emotional volatility**, new social hierarchies, and executive function demands that exceed an ADHD learner’s unassisted capacity. This developmental collision can intensify every emotional response and create a sharp performance drop without deliberate choice.

#### 3. Trauma or Threat Response

For some children, being disciplined evokes **a nervous system trauma response** — especially if it felt public, unjust, or unpredictable. Neurologically, the amygdala reacts as if to real danger, leading to “fight” (defiance), “flight” (leaving class), or “freeze” (shutdown) behaviours. Once this association forms, school cues can retrigger survival instincts, not conscious misbehaviour.

#### 4. Cognitive and Social Attribution Changes

After one painful “rejection” experience, ADHD children can become **hypervigilant to hostile cues** — interpreting neutral teacher feedback as attack, and peers’ indifference as exclusion . This social-cognitive shift reinforces defensive patterns.

#### 5. Identity Reconstruction

Children with ADHD often swing between perfectionism and self-sabotage (the two faces of RSD). When her “good girl” identity broke, adopting a “naughty” one might have offered psychological safety — it’s less painful to reject expectations than risk being rejected again.

### Integrating These Insights

The situation likely represents **a convergence** of RSD, autistic-like burnout patterns (masking exhaustion), and the trauma physiology of being publicly “in trouble.” Moving forward:

- **Validation before correction** — acknowledging her hurt from that event helps rebuild trust.
- **Collaborative re-entry planning** — ensure school staff know she is not defiant but dysregulated.
- **Therapeutic approaches** such as emotion coaching, trauma-informed CBT, or neurodiversity-affirming mentoring can help her separate identity from criticism.
- **Parent coaching** or family therapy can support co-regulation between you both when RSD responses escalate.

Your interpretation is sophisticated, but broadening it to include **masking fatigue, developmental stress, and trauma response** adds nuance without diminishing the core RSD insight: her behaviour is an expression of pain, not defiance.

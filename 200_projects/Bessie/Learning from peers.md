## Learning by Observation and Social Influence

The sources emphasize that children learn significantly from observing others, particularly those close to them, such as peers and family members [4]. This learning can include both helpful and unhelpful responses to situations [4]. If Bessie is in a class where peers react to difficulty by disengaging, acting out, or demonstrating a lack of effort, she is likely to internalize and mimic these "unhelpful responses" [4, 6]. This creates a "vicious cycle" where negative peer behavior reinforces her own challenges, especially given her difficulties with concentration and task initiation when not interested [6-9]. The concept of "social learning" goes beyond simply changing habits; it helps individuals understand their behavior cognitively and emotionally within social situations [2, 10].

## Impact on Anxiety and Confidence

Bessie already experiences anxiety in school situations, exacerbated by concerns about "people shouting at me, people not listening to me" [7, 11, 12]. Her past experiences of teachers telling her to leave the classroom for not understanding further reinforce this fear [13-15]. If her peers also react negatively to misunderstanding or making mistakes, it can amplify her fears of judgment and embarrassment, making her even more reluctant to ask clarifying questions or engage in the learning process [16, 17]. Conversely, if peers exhibit pro-social, pro-learning behaviors like asking questions, discussing work, and openly using learning techniques, Bessie would be exposed to positive coping mechanisms, potentially reducing her anxiety and increasing her confidence in seeking help or trying [17-20].

## The Role of Masking and Exhaustion

For neurodivergent individuals like Bessie, who has ADHD and likely dyslexia [7, 11], there is a significant pressure to "mask" or camouflage natural traits to fit in or meet perceived expectations [3, 21]. This masking is incredibly draining and can lead to "after-school collapse" or "shutdowns" [22, 23]. If her peer group is unsupportive or exhibits negative behaviors, the effort required to mask and navigate that social dynamic at school would be even greater, leading to further exhaustion and decreased capacity for learning [24]. When she is depleted, behaviors like defiance or withdrawal, which the school reports as "losing her way" [6, 25], are more likely to emerge.

## Consequences of Negative Peer Dynamics

The sources provide direct evidence of negative peer impact:

- Bessie's tutor notes that her friends are getting "frustrated" with her because she is "always off with someone else or walking off" and "not in lessons with me anymore" [26]. This indicates that her disengagement is negatively affecting her friendships, which are important to her [27, 28].
- The concept of "reputation" is explicitly mentioned, where Bessie's frequent removals from class contribute to how teachers (and implicitly, peers) perceive her, making it harder for her to get the benefit of the doubt [15]. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy or "vicious cycle" [8].

## Strategies for Fostering Positive Peer Influence

The sources advocate for creating a supportive learning environment that can mitigate negative peer influence and promote positive social learning:

- Human Connection and Warmth: A "low-fear, high-trust atmosphere" where "shaming is not allowed" is crucial for students with ADHD [29, 30]. This environment encourages open participation and reduces the fear of making mistakes in front of peers [16, 19].
- Collaborative Learning: Encouraging "discussion and debate" and working in "small-group discussions" are specifically recommended for Bessie in subjects like English and Film Studies, leveraging her strong verbal skills [31-33]. Working with a "study buddy or a small study group can motivate you" and "can deepen your learning" by allowing friends to point out errors and fostering "motivation contagion" [34, 35].
- Project-Based Learning: This method encourages innovation and initiative [30], allowing students to work together on shared goals, which can naturally foster positive peer interaction and learning.
- "Buddy" Systems: For school attendance difficulties, the use of "buddies" is suggested, where another pupil provides support [36]. This is a direct example of structured positive peer influence.
- Praise and Positive Reinforcement: Focusing praise on effort and "having a go" rather than just the outcome [18, 37-39] helps build a growth mindset and can encourage other students to also embrace trying new things without fear of failure.

In essence, your thought highlights a critical systemic factor: the social ecosystem of the classroom. Just as a plant thrives in fertile soil, a student, especially one with complex needs like Bessie, thrives in a supportive and constructive peer environment.

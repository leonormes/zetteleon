The 'Do' stage involves the consistent implementation of agreed strategies across all lessons and subjects. This requires coordination between all teaching staff and support personnel.

## Evidence-Based Implementation Strategies

### Adaptive Focus Management

- [[Gain focus and productivity with the Pomodoro Technique]] - Implement adaptive timing across all subjects: "You can adjust the length of pomodoro sessions to align with your work habits... Use it when you find it's most helpful, for example, when you're working on a project that has multiple moving parts"
- [[Learn Like a Pro]] - Use flexible Pomodoros that align with Bessie's natural hyperfocus patterns while ensuring breaks prevent overwhelm

### Working Memory Support Systems

- [[Learn Like a Pro]] - External working memory strategies: "Putting a key word, number, or formula on paper extends your working memory to the paper"
- [[I learned a system for remembering everything]] - Note-taking systems that create an "exterior brain" for organizing information

### ADHD-Aware Teaching Approaches

- [[Adhd 2.0]] - Understanding Task-Positive Network (TPN) engagement and avoiding Default Mode Network (DMN) traps
- [[Solving the Procrastination Puzzle]] - Implementation intentions for task initiation across all subjects

## Key Implementation Areas

- **Consistent Use of Visual Aids**: Ensure that all teachers use visual supports, including mind maps, diagrams, and color-coding, to help Bessie process and retain information.
- **Structured Note-Taking Support**: Provide consistent scaffolding for note-taking across subjects, including templates, guided notes, and opportunities for Bessie to use her preferred methods.
- **Regular Movement Breaks**: Implement scheduled movement breaks within lessons to help manage attention and reduce restlessness.
- **Clear Instructions and Expectations**: Ensure all teachers provide clear, step-by-step instructions and check for understanding before proceeding.
- **Consistent Feedback and Encouragement**: Maintain a positive, encouraging approach that focuses on effort and progress rather than just outcomes.

## Coordination Requirements

- **Staff Training**: Ensure all teaching staff understand Bessie's specific needs and the strategies that work best for her.
- **Communication Systems**: Establish clear communication channels between teachers, support staff, and parents to share what's working and what needs adjustment.
- **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Regularly review the effectiveness of strategies and make adjustments as needed based on Bessie's response and progress.

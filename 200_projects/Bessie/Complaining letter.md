**Subject: URGENT FORMAL COMPLAINT: Persistent Failure to Implement Bessie Ormes' Special Educational Needs (SEN) Provision and Detrimental Impact on Her Well-being**

Dear Ms. Williams,

I am writing to formally express my grave concerns and dissatisfaction regarding the ongoing and critical inconsistency in the provision of Special Educational Needs (SEN) support for my daughter, Bessie Ormes (Year 8, DOB: 30/03/2012) [3-9]. Despite multiple discussions, explicit agreements, and the school's clear understanding of Bessie's Individual Support Plan (ISP) / Individual Education Plan (IEP), the core issue of inconsistent implementation remains unresolved, profoundly impacting her education and well-being [3-8, 10].

Following our previous meetings and communications, including the meeting on 18/06/25 [11], we established a "Personalised Educational Pathway" for Bessie [previous conversation]. Key agreed actions were:

- **Formalised Accommodations:** Guaranteed use of a laptop for all extended writing tasks in class, homework, and internal/external examinations [12, 13].
- **Accessible Resources:** A school-wide commitment to providing printed resources on blue paper to negate the need for copying from the board, addressing her dyslexia and Mearles Irlen syndrome [12-18].
- **Examination Access Arrangements:** Confirmation of her eligibility for 25% Extra Time in all timed examinations [12, 13, 19-27].
- **Anxiety Management:** Consistent application of strategies for managing anxiety, such as pre-arranged access to a quiet space (sensory room/cubby) and effective use of the timeout card system, without negative repercussions [11, 18, 28-40].
- **"Learning Passport":** The creation and consistent use of a student-friendly "Learning Passport" by all staff to ensure awareness of her needs and strategies [previous conversation].
- **Teacher Accountability:** Measures to address the "critical and damaging inconsistency" in how her needs are met, including specific training and accountability for all staff interacting with Bessie [3-6, 8, 41-43].
- **Proactive Communication:** Bessie was encouraged to write a letter to her teachers to explain her needs for a "fresh start," to be followed by one-to-one visits by staff [11, 44-48].
- **Progress Monitoring:** Implementation of a "report card" or similar mechanism for Bessie to track the application of her support strategies in each lesson [11, 30, 46, 49, 50].

Despite these agreements, it is evident that these vital provisions are not being consistently implemented across all subjects and by all staff. Bessie continues to report significant inconsistencies, including:

- **Failure to Adapt Tasks and Provide Promised Resources:** Bessie frequently reports not being given extra time for tasks, that topics are not sufficiently broken down in subjects like Maths, and that she often has to copy extensively from the board, even when blue paper resources should be provided [4-8, 14-18]. This highlights a fundamental misunderstanding of her memory and processing challenges [4-8].
- **Inconsistent Teacher Attitude and Support:** We have documented instances where teachers respond negatively when Bessie struggles to understand, telling her it is her "own fault" or instructing her to leave the classroom [4-8, 10, 17, 51]. This is contrary to a supportive learning environment.
- **Inadequate Anxiety Support:** While the "timeout card" is in place, Bessie feels it offers inadequate support, often being "on show" or being told to simply "leave the classroom" rather than being directed to a designated quiet space as agreed [28, 32, 33, 35, 37-40, 52].
- **Lack of Clear Feedback and Progress Tracking:** Bessie reports having no real sense of her performance in subjects, leading to feelings of being "lost and guessing at her own progress" [4-8]. The agreed "report card" system does not appear to be consistently utilized or effective [46].

The immediate and direct impact of this lack of consistent support is Bessie’s increased anxiety, disengagement, and a detrimental effect on her emotional well-being and behavior at school, including instances of truancy and self-harm concerns [4-8, 10, 42, 53-74]. Her behavior at home, where her needs are consistently met, remains starkly different from her school presentation [10].

These failures directly contradict Belfairs Academy's legal duties under the Equality Act 2010, which requires schools to make reasonable adjustments for disabled students and avoid unfavorable treatment [59, 75-79]. Furthermore, they are in direct conflict with the findings of your recent Ofsted report, which rated "Quality of education" and "Leadership and management" as "Requires improvement" [80]. Specifically:

- The report noted "weaknesses in how the curriculum is taught mean that pupils do not achieve as well as they should in Years 7 to 11" [81, 82]. The inconsistent implementation of Bessie's ISP is a clear manifestation of this systemic weakness.
- The report stated "some teaching is not focused on making sure that pupils understand and remember long term the knowledge that has been identified in the school's curriculum" [81, 82]. This aligns with Bessie's experience of lessons not being adapted for her learning style.
- The report indicated that the school "has not thought enough about how to check what pupils know and understand as they progress" [82], leading to pupils repeating mistakes and struggling to commit knowledge to long-term memory – a direct result of inadequate differentiation and feedback for Bessie.
- While the report claimed that "Teachers adapt resources well to meet the needs of individual pupils" with SEND [81], Bessie’s daily experience clearly contradicts this assertion. This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the school's SEND provision.
- The ongoing issues demonstrate that leadership has not taken "timely and credible steps to assure itself that pupils' outcomes in Years 7 to 11 are likely to improve" [81].

At our upcoming follow-up meeting, to verify that consistent changes have been made, we expect to see concrete evidence of the following:

- **Documented Implementation of Support Strategies:**
  - Examples of differentiated lesson materials (e.g., worksheets, presentation slides on blue paper) used in Bessie's lessons across *all* subjects [16, 83].
  - Records of consistent laptop use for extended writing and notes in lessons and tests [12, 13].
  - Specific examples from subject teachers demonstrating how complex tasks are broken down into manageable chunks and how scaffolding is provided for longer tasks, particularly in Maths [82].
- **Teacher Briefings/Training Records:** Evidence that *all* teaching staff have been explicitly briefed and/or trained on Bessie's specific needs (ADHD, dyslexia, anxiety, Mearles Irlen syndrome) and the agreed support strategies [84].
- **Bessie's "Learning Passport":** A copy of the "Learning Passport" and documented evidence of how it has been shared with and utilized by her subject teachers [previous conversation].
- **Anxiety Management Protocol:** Confirmation of how the "timeout card" system is consistently managed across all lessons, and evidence that staff understand and facilitate her pre-arranged access to a quiet space (sensory room/cubby) without telling her to leave the classroom [18, 28-30, 32, 33, 35, 37-40, 52].
- **Progress Tracking Data:** Review of the "report card" or similar tracking mechanisms to show how individual teachers are consistently marking whether Bessie's strategies are being applied, and the resulting impact on her engagement, punctuality, and academic progress across all subjects [11, 30, 46, 49, 50].
- **Communication Log:** A detailed record of internal communications and follow-ups with teachers regarding Bessie's support [previous conversation].
- **JCQ Documentation:** Confirmation of the application for 25% extra time for examinations, including relevant Form 8 or Form 9 documentation and evidence of assessor qualification, as per JCQ regulations [19-27].

This meeting is critical. The school has had ample time to implement the necessary changes. If, at this follow-up meeting, it is clear that the school has not consistently and effectively implemented the agreed-upon strategies, and we are not satisfied with the evidence of progress, we will immediately proceed with formal escalation.

In that event, please be advised that we will be taking the following immediate steps:

1. **Contacting the Local Authority SEND Team:** We will formally contact the Southend-on-Sea local authority's Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) team to seek advice, explore mediation, and initiate disagreement resolution arrangements, as outlined in the school's own SEND policy [79, 85, 86].
2. **Submitting to Ofsted Parent View:** We will submit detailed feedback to Ofsted Parent View, outlining the ongoing lack of consistent support and its severe negative impact on Bessie's education and well-being. Ofsted utilizes this information when planning inspections [79, 85, 87, 88].

We trust that you understand the seriousness of this situation and Bessie's right to an inclusive and supportive educational environment that meets her diagnosed needs. We look forward to a detailed and actionable plan from the school to rectify these long-standing issues immediately.

Sincerely,

**[Your Name(s)]**
Parents of Bessie Ormes

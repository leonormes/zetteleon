Of course. Here is a summary of the key points from your conversation with Bessie about her school lessons.

Summary of Bessie's Feedback on School Lessons

Bessie's engagement and focus in school are significantly influenced by the teaching style and the level of support she receives. She thrives in interactive and engaging lessons but struggles when she perceives a subject as "boring" or when teaching methods are not adapted to her needs.

Key Points:

- Engagement in Lessons:
  - Bessie finds history to be her most interesting subject.
  - She recalled a particularly engaging history lesson about Eleanor of Aquitaine from the previous year. The use of music and varied activities, such as videos and mix-and-match exercises without copying from the board, made it enjoyable and effective for her.
  - Bessie feels that any subject can be interesting if taught in the right way. When lessons are presented in a boring manner, she loses focus quickly.
- Implementation of IEP Strategies:
  - Bessie reports inconsistencies in the application of her Individual Education Plan (IEP) strategies across different subjects and teachers.
  - Extra Time: She states that teachers do not give her extra time for tasks, especially larger ones.
  - Breaking Down Tasks: While teachers in most subjects will break down a new topic the first time it is taught, they expect her to remember it subsequently without further breakdown. This is exemplified by her maths lessons on ratios.
  - Copying Notes: Bessie has never been provided with keywords or printed materials to make copying from the board easier.
  - Assistive Technology: She is sometimes allowed to use a laptop for longer writing tasks but has to ask for it.
  - Coloured Paper: Bessie is supposed to have blue paper for all subjects but currently only has it for English, Maths, Science, and History.
- Teacher Support and Attitude:
  - When she is struggling with a topic or with spelling, teacher responses vary significantly.
  - Some teachers, like Mr. Gordon in Maths, will provide one-to-one support, which she finds very helpful.
  - However, she claims most teachers react negatively, sometimes telling her to leave the classroom if she does not understand. Mr. Concannon, Mr. Adolfo and Miss Linaka were mentioned in this context.
  - Praise is often focused on getting the right answer rather than effort or the strategies used. Some teachers will acknowledge her effort but in a way she perceives as negative.
- Anxiety and Social-Emotional Support:
  - When feeling anxious or overwhelmed, Bessie is allowed five minutes out of class.
  - This short break is helpful for minor anxiety but is insufficient when she is highly anxious, as there is no guided support to help her calm down.
  - She feels that her teachers do not understand what she needs when she is anxious.
  - With some teachers, she can use a timeout pass to go to a quieter space when lessons are noisy.
- Understanding Her Own Progress:
  - Bessie is unsure how well she is doing in her subjects and has to guess her performance level.
  - She gauges her performance in Maths as poor, based on a lack of help. She believes that knowing if she gets answers right or wrong is a basic indicator of her performance.

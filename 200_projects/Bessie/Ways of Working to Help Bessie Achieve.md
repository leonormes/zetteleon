## Harness and Integrate Passions and Interests

Cross-Curricular Connections: Actively seek and highlight links between her subjects, turning her entire GCSE curriculum into a coherent project [15, 43]. For example, relating History topics like Weimar and Nazi Germany to Film Studies and Art [16].

Personalised Projects: Directly link project work to her passions. In Art, she could explore special effects make-up or the anatomy of horses [4]. In Photography, she could focus on equestrian events or creating make-up she has designed [12]. In Film Studies, analyze mise-en-scène through the lens of make-up [17].

Real-World Relevance: Connect abstract concepts to her interests (e.g., calculating special effects ingredients in Maths, forces in horse jumping in Science) [7, 8].

Choice: Allow her to choose topics within subjects that align with her interests for creative writing or spoken language assessments [9].

## Provide Structured, Chunked, and Scaffolded Information

Break Down Tasks: Present information and tasks in small, manageable chunks to avoid overwhelming her and support executive function challenges [4-8, 12, 17, 22, 23, 44, 45]. Break down projects into distinct, achievable tasks with clear deadlines [4].

Formulaic Approaches: Use consistent templates for note-taking in subjects like Film Studies [17] and formulaic, step-by-step approaches for exam questions in English Language [9].

Visual Structures: Use visual timelines in History [5], knowledge organisers in Science [8], and graphic organizers for Maths formulae [7].

Scaffolding: Provide clear structures, paragraph-by-paragraph guidance, and sentence starters for writing tasks [5, 9, 17, 46].

## Leverage Visual Learning and Digital Resources

Digital Portfolios: Encourage the use of a laptop for digital portfolios in Art and Photography for easy organization and annotation [4, 12].

Visual Planning Tools: Use mind maps, storyboards, and screen-capture tools for planning and analysis in creative subjects [4, 5, 12, 17].

Dyslexia-Friendly Formats: All resources (worksheets, notes, texts) should be printed on blue paper, well-spaced, with clear, sans-serif fonts [5-9, 13, 17, 45, 47-53]. Provide pre-prepared summary sheets to reduce copying [5].

Technology Integration: Use laptops for all extended writing tasks and summative tests [7, 9, 13, 45, 49, 54]. Utilize online learning platforms with interactive, chunked content (e.g., BBC Bitesize, Seneca Learning, Corbettmaths) [7, 8].

Audio Support: Use text-to-speech software for unseen texts in English Language [9], and audio versions of key religious texts or audiobooks for English Literature [6, 13].

Concrete Manipulatives: For Maths and Science, use physical manipulatives (number lines, algebra tiles, 3D shapes, Molymod, play-doh) to make abstract concepts concrete [7, 8].

## Maximize Verbal Processing and Discussion

Verbalisation: Encourage her to "talk through" her thoughts and analysis before writing, which helps structure her ideas [7-9, 23, 55].

Debate and Discussion: Foster regular small-group discussions and formal debates, especially in subjects like Film Studies and Philosophy & Ethics, to consolidate understanding [6, 17, 19].

"Teaching" Concept: A powerful active learning technique is for her to explain a concept she has learned to a peer or adult [7, 55].

## Build Confidence Through Success and Positive Reinforcement

Praise Effort: Consistently praise her effort, logical thinking, perseverance, and attempts ("having a go"), rather than just the correct outcome [7, 8, 30, 56-58]. This fosters a growth mindset [30, 56, 57].

Early Successes: Structure early projects in Year 10 with clear, scaffolded success criteria to build a positive feedback loop [4].

Low-Stakes Practice: Implement regular, low-stakes quizzes and timed practice of smaller tasks to build stamina and confidence incrementally [4, 5, 8, 9].

Acknowledge and Validate Emotions: Create opportunities to talk about worries [49]. Acknowledge and validate her anxiety, framing mistakes as "detective work" rather than failures [7, 59].

Predictable Structure: The structured nature of exams (e.g., Philosophy & Ethics) and formulaic approaches can reduce anxiety [6, 9].

Focus on Strengths: Consistently leverage her strengths, allowing them to flourish and build confidence [4, 6-9, 12, 13, 17, 60].

## Support Independence and Self-Advocacy

Ownership of Learning: Empower her to take ownership of her learning by involving her in goal-setting and strategy development [61-64].

"Learning Passport": Create a student-friendly summary of her key learning strategies and accommodations for her to share with teachers, fostering independence [61].

Time-Out Passes/Quiet Spaces: Continue to allow and facilitate the use of time-out passes or access to a quiet/sensory room when she feels overwhelmed [50, 65-67].

Teacher Communication: Encourage her to communicate her needs to teachers, potentially through a letter to teachers explaining her needs [68, 69].

Independent Tasks: Provide opportunities to complete easy tasks independently before moving to more complex ones [70, 71].

## Targeted Memory and Organizational Support

Digital Flashcards: Use apps like Quizlet or Anki for digital flashcards (with images) for key terms, definitions, and quotes in History, Philosophy & Ethics, and English Literature [5, 6, 13].

Key Quote Toolkit: Focus on memorizing a manageable number of powerful quotes in English Literature, creating a "toolkit" for exams [13].

Visual Planners/Checklists: Use large A3 planners or whiteboards for visual mapping [4], "shot list" checklists for photography [12], and topic checklists in Maths and Science [7, 8]. A personal "Bessie checklist" for strategies can be useful [72].

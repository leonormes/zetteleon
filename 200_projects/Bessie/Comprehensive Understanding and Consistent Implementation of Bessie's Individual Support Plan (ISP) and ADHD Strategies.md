title: "Comprehensive Understanding and Consistent Implementation of Bessie's Individual Support Plan (ISP) and ADHD Strategies"

- Failing Identified: Bessie's experience indicates inconsistent implementation of her ISP and ADHD strategies across teachers and subjects. There's a gap between the school's stated "quality first teaching and additional adaptations" and Bessie's lived reality. Her 2019 EP report recommended many strategies that align with her current ADHD diagnosis, yet she reports them not being consistently applied.
- What to Ask the School to DO:
  - Mandate Consistent Application: Ensure *all* her teachers consistently apply the strategies outlined in Bessie's ISP and the recommendations from her ADHD diagnosis and previous EP report.
  - Specific Accommodations: Specifically request that teachers consistently provide:
    - Extra time for processing instructions and tasks, especially large ones.
    - Large tasks broken down into smaller, achievable chunks, even for concepts previously taught.
    - Visual and verbal prompts for strategies, and explicit checks for understanding before tasks.
    - Keywords, the long date, or printed materials to reduce copying from the board.
    - Consistent use of blue paper for resources and books across *all* subjects for her Mearles Irlen syndrome.
    - Proactive offering and expectation of her school laptop for longer writing tasks and tests, rather than her always having to ask.
    - Praise for effort and the strategies used, not just for getting the "right" answer.
- What to Ask the School to PROVE:
  - Updated ISP Distribution & Acknowledgment: Provide a copy of Bessie's current ISP and proof that *all* her subject teachers have read, understood, and signed off on it, committing to its implementation.
  - Teacher Training Logs: Produce training logs (dates, content, attendees) specifically demonstrating recent, mandatory professional development for *all* teaching staff on ADHD, neurodiversity-affirming practices, and strategies for supporting students with executive function challenges and sensory sensitivities, especially "masking" in adolescent girls.
  - Lesson Plan Evidence: Show examples of lesson plans from various subjects that explicitly detail how Bessie's accommodations (e.g., differentiated instructions, task breakdown, blue paper use, laptop integration) are being planned and delivered.
  - Classroom Observation Records: Provide recent classroom observation records (by SENCo or other designated staff) that specifically comment on the consistent application of Bessie's support strategies by her different teachers in real-time.

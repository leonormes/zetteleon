- "Even when a maths problem feels really hard, what's one tiny thing you *could* try, even if it's just writing down the first number or drawing a simple part of the problem?" - *Encourages breaking tasks into small, achievable chunks to build confidence.*
- "If you were to break down a maths topic you're struggling with into really, really small steps, what would the first super-easy step be that you know you could definitely do?" - *Promotes systematic thinking and a step-by-step approach to problem-solving.*
- "When you've tried something difficult, even if it didn't work out perfectly, what did you learn from the attempt itself?" - *Encourages a growth mindset, focusing on effort and learning from mistakes rather than just the outcome.*
- "What makes you feel confident when you're trying a new, difficult thing in any subject, even if it's not maths?" - *Helps identify general self-efficacy sources and apply them to maths.*

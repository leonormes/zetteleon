## The Foundry: Breaking Down "The Two Views of Maths"

This demonstrates how the original note can be transformed into a set of interconnected, atomic ideas ready for further thought.

## The New Atomic Notes (The Forged Ingots)

### Note 1: The Core Disconnect

Title: [[Public perception of maths is incomplete, not wrong]]

## Note 2: The First View

Title: [[Applicative maths is the use of pre-discovered patterns as tools]]

### Note 3: The Second View

Title: [[Generative maths is the creative discovery of abstract patterns]]

### Note 4: The Analogy

Title: [[A Car Mechanic Versus an Engineer Is a Strong Analogy for the Two Views of Maths]]

## The Synthesis (The Workbench)

### Map of Content: Maths Education MOC

This is my workbench for thinking about the purpose and perception of mathematics education.

Core Tension:

The central conflict in maths education is that it primarily teaches [[Applicative maths is the use of pre-discovered patterns as tools|maths-as-a-tool]], while the soul of the discipline lies in [[Generative maths is the creative discovery of abstract patterns|maths-as-discovery]]. This leads to the [[Public perception of maths is incomplete, not wrong|widespread but incomplete public view of the subject]].

**Key Analogies:**

- The most effective way I've found to explain this is that [[A Car Mechanic Versus an Engineer Is a Strong Analogy for the Two Views of Maths|it's the difference between a mechanic and an engineer]].

**Developing Thoughts & Open Questions:**

- If we accept this disconnect, what is the actual *purpose* of compulsory maths education? Is it to create competent "mechanics" for the economy, or is it to foster the "engineering" mindset of logical and abstract thought?
- How could we introduce generative thinking into the curriculum without sacrificing applicative skill?
- Does my own experience with ADHD give me a different perspective on the 'pattern-spotting' nature of generative maths? Is there a link between neurodivergence and mathematical thinking?

You've hit on the fundamental disconnect perfectly. Your view of mathematics as the **science of patterns and structure** is precisely how modern mathematicians see their field. It's about discovering the hidden, abstract framework behind everything from the distribution of prime numbers to the shape of the universe.

The conflict you've identified is real and stems from people experiencing two very different things under the same name.

## **The Two Views of Maths**

Your distinction between 'applicative' and 'generative' is an excellent way to put it.

- **Applicative Maths (The Public View):** This is the mathematics most people learn and use. It's a vast collection of powerful, pre-discovered patterns (like calculus or algebra) that have been refined into reliable tools. The goal is to take a specific tool and **apply** it to a real-world problem to get a practical answer. It is utilitarian, incredibly useful, and for most people, it's all they need maths to be.
- **Generative Maths (The Mathematician's View):** This is the work of discovering those patterns in the first place. It asks questions like "What are the fundamental properties of this structure?", "Does a pattern exist here at all?", and "Can I prove this pattern holds true for all cases?". This is a creative, exploratory process that **generates** new tools, new structures, and new understanding.

## **Why The Views Don't Align**

The public perception isn't wrong; it's just incomplete. It's like the difference between a skilled car mechanic and an automotive engineer.

- The **mechanic** is a master of the *applicative*. They know the existing systems inside out and can expertly apply tools to fix a problem.
- The **engineer** is a master of the *generative*. They understand the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and materials science to design a new type of engine from the ground up.

Both are brilliant and essential, but they are doing fundamentally different jobs. The public interacts with the 'mechanics' of mathematics, so it's natural that they view the entire subject through that practical, utilitarian lens. Your journey into proofs and logic is you moving from learning how the car works to learning how to design the engine.

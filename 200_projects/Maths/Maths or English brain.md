There is no scientific evidence to support the myths that some people have a "maths brain" or that boys are naturally better at maths than girls; these ideas come from outdated stereotypes and a misunderstanding of how the brain learns.

## The Myth of the "Maths Brain vs. English Brain"

This is a deep-rooted myth that stems from a few key sources.

- Where it comes from:
  1. The "Left Brain/Right Brain" Misconception: This popular but outdated idea suggested the left side of the brain was logical and analytical (for maths and science) while the right side was creative and intuitive (for arts and language). Modern neuroscience shows this is a vast oversimplification. Complex tasks like mathematics and language require communication between many different areas across both hemispheres of the brain.
  2. Fixed Mindset Culture: It's culturally acceptable in the UK to say "I'm not a numbers person." This reflects a "fixed mindset"—the belief that ability is innate and unchangeable. It's an easy excuse for finding a subject difficult, rather than seeing the struggle as a normal part of the learning process.
  3. Narrow Teaching Methods: When maths is taught purely as a subject of rigid rules and memorisation, it can appear to suit only one type of thinking. This ignores the fact that higher-level maths is incredibly creative, requiring pattern-spotting, visualisation, and elegant problem-solving.
- What the Evidence Shows: The overwhelming evidence points to neuroplasticity. The brain is not fixed; it is constantly changing and building new connections in response to experience. When you practise a skill, you are physically changing your brain. The brains of mathematicians are not different at birth; they become different through thousands of hours of practice, struggle, and deep thought. Anyone can grow their "maths brain" with the right mindset and teaching.

## The Myth of Gender and Maths

This is a damaging stereotype with purely social, not biological, origins.

- Where it comes from:
  1. Historical Stereotypes: For centuries, women were actively excluded from formal education in mathematics and science. The myth that boys were "naturally" better arose not from evidence of ability, but from a lack of female opportunity and representation.
  2. Societal Bias: Research has shown that parents and teachers can unconsciously treat boys and girls differently. Boys are often encouraged to be bold and take risks, while girls are praised for being neat and following rules. This can lead to boys developing more confidence in trial-and-error problem-solving, while girls may develop a greater fear of making mistakes.
  3. Stereotype Threat: This is a well-documented psychological phenomenon. When a person is aware of a negative stereotype about their group (e.g., "girls aren't good at maths"), the anxiety of potentially confirming that stereotype can cause them to underperform on a test, even if they are perfectly capable.
- What the Evidence Shows: Large-scale international studies, like the PISA tests which assess 15-year-olds across the globe, show that the gender gap in maths is either non-existent or tiny in most countries. In many countries, girls now outperform boys. This proves that culture and teaching, not gender, are the determining factors. There is no evidence for any innate, gender-based difference in mathematical ability.

The common denominator for both these myths is mindset. Believing you can improve and seeing maths as a creative, growing subject are the true keys to success for Bessie, and her gender is completely irrelevant to her potential.

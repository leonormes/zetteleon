## Activity: Unlocking the Power of Simplicity – A Journey Through Expressions

Core Concept: Simplifying an expression means rewriting it in a more efficient, concise, and understandable form without changing its value. It's about finding clarity and recognizing underlying patterns and structures.

Mathematical Habits of Mind Emphasized:

- Tinkering: Breaking down and putting back together.
- Describing and Speaking in Mathematical Language: Using precise terms and verbalizing understanding.
- Visualizing: Externalizing internal thoughts and problems.

## Level 1: Concrete Exploration – The "Like Terms" Analogy

Goal: To intuitively grasp the concept of "like terms" and why only like terms can be combined.

Materials: Different coloured blocks or small objects (e.g., red squares, blue circles, green triangles).

Procedure:

1. Introduction to "Items": Place a mix of objects on a table. "Imagine these are items in a shop. Can you easily count how many 'red squares' there are?". (Expected answer: No, they remain separate categories).
2. Introducing Variables (Mathematical Language): Explain that in mathematics, we use letters (variables) to represent unknown quantities or categories of items. For example, $r$ for red squares, $b$ for blue circles.
3. Forming Simple Expressions: Ask the participant to represent their grouped items using variables. E.g., if they have 3 red squares and 2 blue circles, they write $3r + 2b$. If they add 2 more red squares, how would the expression change? $3r + 2b + 2r$
4. Simplifying (Combining Like Terms): Guide them to combine the $r$ terms: $5r + 2b$. Emphasize that $r$ and $b$ are "unlike terms" and cannot be combined further, just like apples and oranges.
5. Discussion: "Why is $5r + 2b$ 'simpler' than $3r + 2b + 2r$? What does 'simpler' mean here?" (It's more concise and easier to understand the total quantity of each item).

Next Step Suggestion: Explore an everyday scenario like a fruit stand. "If a fruit stand has 5 apples and 3 bananas, and you buy 2 more apples and sell 1 banana, how would you represent the final inventory using variables and then simplify the expression?" This helps ground the concept in a familiar context.

## Level 2: Abstracting to Numbers and Basic Variables

Goal: To formalize the process of combining like terms with numerical coefficients and constant terms.

Materials: Whiteboard or paper, markers.

Procedure:

1. Review of Order of Operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS): Briefly review that calculations have a specific order [19, 20]. This is a foundational "rule" or "algorithm" that makes calculations reliable [4, 21].
2. Expressions with Numbers Only: Provide expressions like $5 + 3 - 2$ or $(4  2) + 7$ and ask for the "simplified" (calculated) answer. "How does BODMAS help us ensure we get the right answer consistently?" [20].
3. Expressions with One Variable and Constants: Introduce expressions like $7x + 3 + 2x - 1$.
4. Identifying Like Terms (Pattern Detection): Ask the participant to identify groups of "like terms." Point out that constant numbers (like 3 and -1) are also "like terms" because they can be combined [5]. "What pattern do you see in terms that can be combined?" (They have the same variable raised to the same power, or they are both constants) [8].
5. Combining Coefficients: Guide the participant to combine the coefficients of the like terms and the constant terms separately. $(7x + 2x) + (3 - 1) = 9x + 2$
6. Visualization: Encourage writing terms with their signs clearly, perhaps by circling or underlining them differently. "How can you visually organize the terms to make sure you don't miss any or mix them up?".

Next Step Suggestion: Present a slightly more complex expression like $5a - 8 + 2a + 10 - a$. Ask them to simplify it and explain their steps, focusing on their use of the "like terms" rule and how they manage the signs.

Level 3: Introducing More Operations and Multiple Variables

Goal: To understand how multiplication and the distributive property affect terms within expressions and how to simplify expressions with multiple variables.

Materials: Whiteboard or paper, markers.

Procedure:

1. Multiplication of Terms:
   - Coefficient x Variable: $3  x$ is $3x$ [23].
   - Variable x Variable: $x  x$ is $x^2$ (x squared) [23]. Explain $x^2$ visually as the area of a square with side $x$ [24]. "How does the notation $x^2$ efficiently describe 'x multiplied by itself'?" [25].
   - Mixed Terms: $2x  3y = 6xy$. Emphasize that the order of multiplication doesn't matter (commutative property) [23].
2. Expressions with Multiple Variables: Introduce expressions like $4x + 2y - x + 5y$.
3. Distributive Property (Expanding Single Brackets): Explain the rule $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ [23, 26].
   - Example: $3(x + 2)$. Guide them to multiply 3 by both x and 2 to get $3x + 6$.
   - Connection to Tinkering: "Think of $3(x+2)$ as having three groups of $x+2$. If you 'break down' each group, how many $x$'s and how many $2$'s do you have in total?" [10, 15].
4. Combining with Expansion: Provide expressions that require both expansion and combining like terms, such as $2(a + 3) + 4a$. First, expand $2(a + 3)$ to $2a + 6$, then combine $2a + 4a$ to get $6a + 6$ [23, 26].

Next Step Suggestion: Present a "real-life" scenario: "You are designing a rectangular garden. One side has length $2x$ meters, and the adjacent side has length $x + 3$ meters. Write an expression for the perimeter of the garden and simplify it. Then, write an expression for the area and simplify it." This connects algebra to geometry and practical problem-solving [27, 28].

Level 4: Advanced Concepts & Strategic Application

Goal: To apply simplifying expressions to more complex algebraic forms, including those leading to equations, and to recognize their use in problem-solving algorithms.

Materials: Whiteboard or paper, markers.

Procedure:

1. Expanding Double Brackets: Introduce the concept of multiplying two binomials, e.g., $(x + 1)(x + 2)$ [23, 26].
   - Method (Algorithm): Guide them through distributing each term from the first bracket to the second (often remembered as FOIL: First, Outer, Inner, Last). $x(x + 2) + 1(x + 2) = x^2 + 2x + x + 2 = x^2 + 3x + 2$ [23].
   - Inventing: "Could you 'invent' a visual representation for $(x+1)(x+2)$ similar to how we visualized $xx$ as an area? What kind of rectangle would you draw?" [9, 13].
2. Factorizing Simple Quadratics: Explain that factorizing is the reverse of expanding, aiming to rewrite an expression as a product of simpler ones [26]. For example, turning $x^2 + 3x + 2$ back into $(x + 1)(x + 2)$.
   - Pattern Recognition: "What patterns do you look for in the constant term and the coefficient of the $x$ term to figure out the factors?" (e.g., factors of 2 that add up to 3) [8].
3. Connecting to Equations: Discuss how simplifying expressions is often the first step in solving equations [29, 30]. For example, $2x + 5 + 3x = 20$ simplifies to $5x + 5 = 20$. "Why is simplifying the expression important before solving the equation?" (It makes the equation easier to manage and solve).
4. Algorithms in Daily Life: Discuss how mathematical procedures, like simplifying expressions, are essentially algorithms – a set of steps to achieve a desired outcome efficiently . Use the example of choosing coupons (20% off vs. $5 off) where algebraic expressions are simplified to find the "optimal leverage point"

Ball Python Genetics: The Maths of Morphs

The Goal: To act like a professional ball python breeder by using probability and algebra to predict the outcome of a breeding project and plan for success.

The Scenario: You are a breeder who wants to produce a beautiful and popular morph called "Pastel". The Pastel gene is recessive. This means a snake needs two copies of the Pastel gene to actually look like a Pastel.

## Part 1: The Generative Part (Discovering the Probabilities)

Let's figure out the chances of producing a Pastel morph. We can do this using a powerful biological tool called a Punnett Square.

- Understanding the Genes (Our Variables):
  - We'll use a capital letter for the normal, dominant gene: N
  - We'll use a lowercase letter for the Pastel, recessive gene: p
    A snake has two copies of every gene, one from each parent. This means there are three possible genetic makeups (genotypes):
  - (NN): A normal snake with two normal genes.
  - (Np): A "Het" (heterozygous) snake. It looks normal, but secretly carries the Pastel gene.
  - (pp): A "Visual Pastel". This is the snake that actually shows the morph, because it has two copies of the recessive gene.
- Setting Up the Puzzle:
  - To have the best chance of producing Pastels, breeders often pair two "Het" snakes (Np). Let's see what happens when we do this.
- The Punnett Square (Our Mathematical Model):
  - Draw a 2x2 grid. Write the genes from one parent across the top, and the genes from the other parent down the side.

|     | N   | P   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N   |     |     |
| P   |     |     |

- Now, fill in each square by combining the letters from the top and the side, like a multiplication table.

|     | N   | P   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N   | NN  | NP  |
| P   | NP  | PP  |

The Discovery: Your Punnett Square is a visual probability calculator! By looking at the four possible outcomes, you have just generated the probabilities for this pairing:

- There is a 1 in 4 chance of producing a normal snake (NN).
- There is a 2 in 4 (or 1 in 2) chance of producing a "Het" snake (Np).
- There is a 1 in 4 chance of producing a visual Pastel snake (pp).

## Part 2: The Applicative Part (Making Predictions)

Now you can use the probabilities you discovered to make predictions, just like a real breeder.

The Situation:

- Your Het female has just laid a clutch of 8 eggs.
  Puzzle 1: Predicting the Morphs
- Based on your probability model, how many of each type of snake would you expect to hatch?
- Expected Normals (NN):
- The probability is 1/4. So, 1/4 × 8 eggs = 2 eggs.
- Expected Hets (Np):
- The probability is 1/2. So, 1/2 × 8 eggs = 4 eggs.
- Expected Visual Pastels (pp):
  - The probability is 1/4. So, 1/4 × 8 eggs = 2 eggs.
    The Prediction: From an 8-egg clutch, you can expect to hatch 2 normals, 4 hets, and 2 beautiful visual Pastels.

## Part 3: The Breeder's Business (Algebraic Modelling)

Let's see if this breeding project makes financial sense. This is where we can generate a formula to model the business side.

The Situation (The Knowns):

- It costs about £20 to incubate one egg and raise the baby snake until it's ready for sale.
- A normal baby snake sells for £40.
- A "Het" baby snake sells for £60 (it's more valuable because it carries the secret gene).
- A visual Pastel morph is highly sought after and sells for £150.
  Puzzle 2: Will the Project be Profitable?
- Generate a Formula for Profit:
  - Let P be the total Profit.
  - Let V be the total Value of all the snakes.
  - Let C be the total Cost to raise them.
  - The rule is simple: Profit = Value - Cost.
  - P = V - C
- Apply Your Formula to the 8-Egg Clutch:
  - Calculate Total Value (V):
    - Value of Normals: 2 × £40 = £80
    - Value of Hets: 4 × £60 = £240
    - Value of Pastels: 2 × £150 = £300
    - V = £80 + £240 + £300 = £620
  - Calculate Total Cost (C):
    - C = 8 eggs × £20/egg = £160
  - Calculate the Final Profit (P): - P = V - C - P = £620 - £160 = £460
    The Discovery: Your mathematical model shows that, based on the probabilities, this breeding project is expected to be very profitable! By using probability and algebra, you have made a strategic decision just like a real breeder.

## Applicative Maths: The Realm of the Proven and Known

This is the mathematics of the school curriculum. From a logical standpoint, it is a closed, certain world.

- **What is Proven?** Everything. Every single tool you learn in school—the quadratic formula, Pythagoras's theorem, the rules of differentiation—is a **proven theorem**. These are statements that have been rigorously derived from a set of foundational axioms (the basic assumptions of mathematics) using the rules of logic.
- **What is Known?** The "known" is the vast library of these proven theorems. The curriculum is a guided tour of a small part of this library. The student's task is not to prove these facts but to *know* them and *know how to apply them*.
- **What is Speculation?** This is entirely absent. In school maths, you are never presented with a problem that has not yet been solved by anyone. There are no open questions or conjectures. The system is designed to provide certainty.
- **What can be Known/Never Known?** These concepts do not apply here. The world of applicative maths is, by definition, the world of things already known. The idea of an "unknowable" mathematical truth is completely outside the scope of the curriculum.

In essence, applicative maths is the act of operating *within* a fixed system of proven results.

## Generative Maths: The Realm of Speculation and the Unknowable

This is the world of the academic mathematician. It is an open, dynamic world defined by its frontiers.

- **What is Proven?** The proven theorems are the starting points, the established territory from which exploration begins. The primary activity is to try and expand this territory.
- **What is Speculation?** This is the driving force. In mathematics, speculation takes the form of **conjectures** A conjecture is a statement that seems to be true based on evidence and patterns, but has not been formally proven Famous examples include the Riemann Hypothesis or the Collatz Conjecture. The mathematician's job is to take a conjecture and either prove it (turning it into a theorem) or disprove it (by finding a counterexample).
- **What is Known?** The "known" is the current, ever-expanding body of proven theorems.
- **What can be Known?** This is the world of active research—the set of all conjectures that mathematicians believe can be proven or disproven with current or conceivable techniques. The goal is to convert the "knowable" into the "known."
- **What can Never be Known?** This is the most profound part. Thanks to the work of Kurt Gödel, we know that in any consistent mathematical system complex enough to do basic arithmetic, there will always be statements that are true but can **never be proven** within that system. These are called **undecidable** statements. This isn't a temporary state of not-yet-proven; it is a fundamental, permanent limitation of logic itself.

## Summary

Using your framework:

- **Applicative/School Maths** operates exclusively in the world of the **Proven** and **Known**. It is a static library of truths.
- **Generative/Academic Maths** operates on the dynamic frontier between **Speculation** and **Proof**, with the goal of turning the **Knowable** into the **Known**, all while being shadowed by the fundamental reality of the **Unknowable**.

## The Scaffolding Approach: What to Learn in Order 🗺️

Mathematics isn't a list of topics; it's a tree. You can't reach the high branches without climbing the trunk. Here is a reliable order to build your knowledge without getting overwhelmed.

### Level 1: The Absolute Foundation (The Grammar of Maths)

This is the most crucial step. Mastering this level makes everything else possible.

- **Proof Techniques:** How to structure a logical argument. This includes direct proof, proof by contradiction, and proof by induction.
- **Basic Logic and Set Theory:** The language of mathematics. Understanding symbols for "for all" ($\forall$), "there exists" ($\exists$), and operations on sets like union ($\cup$) and intersection ($\cap$).

### Level 2: The Core Pillars

Once you have the grammar, you can form sentences and tackle your first major subjects.

- **Discrete Mathematics:** This is the perfect next step for you. It deals with distinct, separate values and is the bedrock of computer science. It includes topics like combinatorics (counting), graph theory, and number theory – all of which appear constantly in places like Project Euler.
- **Pre-Calculus / College Algebra:** This solidifies your understanding of functions, polynomials, trigonometry, and logarithms, which are the essential tools for a huge portion of mathematics.

### Level 3: The First Major Branches

With the pillars in place, you can now confidently branch into the two most significant areas of undergraduate maths.

- **Calculus I & II:** The study of continuous change. This is where you'll formally learn about limits, derivatives (rates of change), and integrals (accumulation).
- **Linear Algebra:** The study of vectors, matrices, and vector spaces. It is immensely powerful and arguably one of the most useful areas of maths for programming, data science, and physics.

## The Methodology: How to Learn Without Burning Out 🔥

This is how you balance the "hard" with the "boring".

### 1. The "Learn and Play" Cycle

Don't just read a textbook for a month. Break your learning into a tight loop.

- **Learn (The Theory):** For one week, focus on learning a single concept from a textbook or video course. For example, "Mathematical Induction". Watch the lectures, read the chapter, and take notes.
- **Play (The Problems):** For the next week, **do not learn anything new**. Instead, dedicate your time to solving problems *only* on that topic. Start with the easy exercises in the book. Then, find more challenging problems from sites like Project Euler or Brilliant.org. This hands-on "play" is what solidifies knowledge and makes it fun.

### 2. Pick a "Spine" Resource

For any given topic (e.g., Discrete Maths), choose **one** high-quality textbook or online course to be your main guide. It's tempting to jump between ten different YouTube videos and five websites, but this often leads to confusion from conflicting notations and approaches. Stick to one "spine" to provide structure, and only use others for supplemental clarification.

### 3. Use the Feynman Technique

This is the ultimate test of your understanding.

1. Take a blank sheet of paper.
2. At the top, write the name of the concept you're studying (e.g., "The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion").
3. Explain the concept in your own words, as if you were teaching it to someone who has never seen it before.
4. When you get stuck, or have to use fuzzy language, you have found a gap in your knowledge. Go back to your "spine" resource, fill that gap, and try again.

By following a structured path and actively mixing theory with problem-solving, you create a positive feedback loop. The theory gives you the tools to solve problems, and solving problems makes the theory meaningful and exciting.

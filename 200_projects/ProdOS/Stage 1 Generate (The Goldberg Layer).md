*The Goal: To capture the raw energy of a thought without judgment.*

This is the initial, messy, and essential act of getting a thought out of your head and onto the page. It overcomes the inertia and "dullness" of translating profound feelings into linear text.

**The Method: Timed Writing Practice**

1. **Set a Timer**: Start with 10 minutes.  
2. **Pick a Topic**: Use the thought, question, or feeling that sparked your interest.  
3. **Write with Momentum**: For the entire duration, you must follow these rules:  
   - **Keep your hand moving**: Don't pause to think or reread. Outrun the censor.  
   - **Don't cross out**: Leave everything, even mistakes. This is not editing.  
   - **Lose control**: Don't worry about logic, spelling, or grammar. Follow the thought wherever it leads.  
   - **Go for the jugular**: If a vulnerable or scary idea emerges, dive into it. That's where the energy is.

**Outcome**: A raw, unedited block of text that contains the "first thoughts" and emotional energy of your idea. It will be messy, and that is the point.

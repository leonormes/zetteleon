Your query instructs me to load the "ADHD blueprint text" and execute it as a prompt, drawing on the comprehensive sources provided. This means I will create a practical, detailed strategy for building a sustainable daily routine tailored for an individual with ADHD, using the established principles of habit formation found in the excerpts from *Atomic Habits* and *Making Habits, Breaking Habits*.

The fundamental approach for building a successful system is shifting focus from **goals** (outcomes) to **systems** (processes). You do not rise to the level of your goals; you fall to the level of your systems. For someone with ADHD, where motivation and follow-through can be inconsistent, a robust, forgiving system is paramount. The framework for building this system is derived from the **Four Laws of Behavior Change**: (1) Make it Obvious, (2) Make it Attractive, (3) Make it Easy, and (4) Make it Satisfying.

Here is a comprehensive strategy focusing on sustainability and accommodating the variability of the ADHD brain.

***

## 1. Starting Small: Foundational Habits (The 3rd Law: Make It Easy)

The key to starting a routine that is not overwhelming is adhering to the Law of Least Effort, recognizing that **energy is precious**, and the brain is wired to conserve it. Instead of relying on willpower, which is a limited resource, the focus must be on making habits so easy you will do them even when you don't feel like it.

The most effective way to counteract the tendency to start too big is to use the **Two-Minute Rule**, which states that when starting a new habit, it should take **less than two minutes to do**. The purpose is not the action itself, but mastering the habit of showing up

### Foundational, ADHD-Friendly Habits (2-3 Examples)

1.  **Hydrate Immediately:**
    -   *Goal:* I want to support cognitive function and start the day energized.
    -   *Two-Minute Rule Version:* **Pour a glass of water and drink it**.
    -   *Accommodation:* Reduce friction (Law 3) by placing a full water bottle directly on your bedside table or next to the faucet the night before [18, 19]. This is also an act of **priming the environment** [20-22].
2.  **Define the Next Action:**
    -   *Goal:* I want to avoid "activation energy" hurdles and context switching overwhelm.
    -   *Two-Minute Rule Version:* **Write down (or speak aloud) the single most important task (MIT) you need to start next** [17].
    -   *Accommodation:* This focuses on the **decisive moment**—the small choice that sets the trajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time [22-24]. Use a colorful sticky note (Make It Obvious) placed directly on the monitor [25].
3.  **Clear the Runway (Mini-Reset):**
    -   *Goal:* I want a distraction-free environment to start focused work.
    -   *Two-Minute Rule Version:* **Tidy the immediate 1-foot radius around your keyboard/workstation** [17].
    -   *Accommodation:* This leverages the power of **environment design** (Law 1) [26, 27]. Remove visual cues for distraction (Make It Invisible) [28]. This micro-action of "resetting the room" prepares for the next action and reduces the cognitive load placed on you by clutter [20, 29, 30].

***

## 2. Structure and Flexibility

The routine must provide structure to mitigate the difficulty ADHD often has with executive function, while remaining flexible to handle fluctuating energy and hyperfocus [1]. Rigidity (fixed output expectation) leads to failure and shame; predictable cues lead to automaticity [31, 32].

### Strategy 1: Create a Clear Map Using Cues (The 1st Law: Make It Obvious)

Habits are easier to build when they are context-dependent [33]. Since time and location are the two most common cues [34, 35], we use specific phrasing to link actions to context.

-   **Implementation Intentions:** This is a crucial strategy for people with ADHD as it sweeps away vague notions (like "I want to work out more") and transforms them into a **concrete plan of action** [36, 37].
    -   *Formula:* **I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]**.
    -   *Example:* I will meditate for one minute at 7:15 a.m. in the quiet corner of my kitchen [26].
-   **Habit Stacking:** This layers new behaviors onto reliable, already-established habits, leveraging the natural momentum of one behavior leading into the next [38, 39].
    -   *Formula:* **After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]** [35, 40].
    -   *Example:* After I close my laptop for lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk [41].
    -   *ADHD Accommodation:* Choose reliable "anchor" habits that happen every day without fail (e.g., getting out of bed, making coffee, sitting down for dinner) [42, 43].

### Strategy 2: Using Timeboxing to Manage Energy and Hyperfocus

Timeboxing ensures consistency by defining fixed time blocks, which increases control and reduces perfectionism [44]. This works well with ADHD because it dictates the *duration* of the effort, not the *output*, providing a natural "off-ramp" before boredom or overwhelm sets in [45-47].

-   **Fixed Effort, Variable Output:** Dedicate a specific, manageable block of time (e.g., 25 minutes) to a process goal, regardless of how much is accomplished. This honors the **process primacy** concept [44].
-   **Hyperfocus Management:** During periods of hyperfocus (when flow state is achieved) [48, 49], the timebox acts as a reminder to take a break or switch to a high-priority task [50, 51]. Use implementation intentions to set boundaries for the hyperfocus task: "If I finish 25 minutes of deep work, then I will immediately review my MIT list for the next action."
-   **Low Energy Accommodation:** On low-energy days, the timebox can be downscaled using the Two-Minute Rule (e.g., instead of 25 minutes of writing, it's 2 minutes of outlining or reading notes) [17].

***

## 3. Implementation Strategies

Specific techniques are highly effective for translating intention into action when working with ADHD [2].

### Visual Cues and Environment Design (1st Law: Make It Obvious)

Making the cues of good habits obvious is essential because the environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior [33].

-   **Visible Reminder System:** Use visual reminders (e.g., the streak of X's on a calendar or a Habits Scorecard) [52, 53]. These cues increase awareness and initiate the next action [52, 54].
-   **Friction Reduction (Make It Easy):** Design your environment to reduce the friction (number of steps) between you and your good habits [22].
    -   If you want to read, place the book on your pillow (or desk) [19, 55].
    -   If you want to exercise, lay out your workout clothes and shoes [19].
    -   If you want to eat fruit, put a display bowl of apples on the counter where you can see them [18, 56].
-   **Friction Increase (Make It Invisible/Difficult):** For bad habits, increase the friction [21, 57]. If wasting time on video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet [12, 58]. Remove the cues of bad habits from your environment [28].

### Accountability Systems (4th Law: Make It Satisfying/Unsatisfying)

Since internal self-control is often unreliable [11, 12], external structure provides immediate reinforcement and punishment [59, 60].

-   **Accountability Partner/Body Doubling:** Having an accountability partner, whether a friend or colleague, can be a powerful motivator [61, 62]. Knowing someone is watching provides an **immediate cost to inaction** [61, 62]. Body doubling (working alongside someone) can initiate focus and sustain the effort during the response phase [63, 64].
-   **Habit Contract:** A formal agreement with an accountability partner outlining commitments and punishments [57, 62, 65]. The costs of violating promises become public and painful [62, 66]. (E.g., giving a friend $50 if you skip your planned 25-minute work block) [66].
-   **Temptation Bundling (Make It Attractive):** Pair an action you *need* to do with an action you *want* to do [18, 67, 68].
    -   *Example:* After I spend 25 minutes defining my project milestones (need), I will listen to my favorite podcast (want) [69].

***

## 4. Dealing with Setbacks

Setbacks are inevitable due to the variability inherent in ADHD [1]. The primary rule for managing failure is to avoid catastrophic thinking (a pessimistic habit of thought) [70, 71].

### The Core Rule: Never Miss Twice

-   **Never miss twice:** If you miss one day, the crucial thing is to **get back on track as quickly as possible** [16, 72, 73]. Research shows that missing a habit once has virtually no impact on long-term success, as long as you get back on track [74]. Missing once is an accident; missing twice is the start of a new habit [75].
-   **Identity Reinforcement:** Focus on casting a vote for your desired identity, even on a bad day [76, 77]. Your goal is not to read a book, the goal is to **become a reader** [78]. If you skip a full workout, simply put on your running shoes (Two-Minute Rule) to affirm the identity: "I am the type of person who does not miss workouts" [77].
-   **Self-Compassion and Reframing:** Avoid blaming yourself for faults or failure; simply observe your actions without judgment [76, 79]. Use **self-affirmation** (thinking about core values) to refuel depleted self-control after a struggle [80]. Recognize that negative thoughts and worries are often attempts to solve problems [71]. **Reframing your mind-set** by highlighting the benefits of avoiding bad habits (Inversion of Law 2) or the benefits of the good habits (changing "I have to" to "I get to") can transform behavior from a burden into an opportunity [81-83].

***

## 5. Gradual Building: Scaling the System

The progression from a tiny habit to a massive outcome requires patience and continuous, incremental refinement [84-86].

1.  **Standardize Before You Optimize:** You cannot improve a habit that does not exist [15, 16]. Spend the first few weeks mastering the art of **showing up** using the Two-Minute Rule [16].
2.  **Habit Shaping:** Once the habit is established (i.e., you are consistently showing up for 2 minutes), begin advancing incrementally [87].
    -   *Stage 1:* Master 2 minutes (e.g., "Open my notes") [17].
    -   *Stage 2:* Advance to 5 minutes (e.g., "Read the headline and first paragraph") [87].
    -   *Stage 3:* Advance to 15 minutes (e.g., "Outline key concepts from the chapter") [87].
    -   *Stage 4:* Integrate timeboxing (e.g., "Study for 25 minutes") [44, 87].
3.  **Reflection Loops (Hansei):** Introduce routine self-monitoring to spot problems and determine if the habit needs adjusting [88, 89]. This is an iterative process [89].
    -   Ask: *Would it be better to perform this habit at a different time of day, or in a different way?* [88]
    -   This weekly review ensures you are working *with* your ADHD variability, identifying where the system creates too much friction or where cues are failing [21, 88].

## Sample Starter Routine for This Week

This sample focuses on the "Make It Obvious" and "Make It Easy" laws, leveraging stacking and priming to establish momentum.

| Time Slot | Anchor Cue (Current Habit) | New Habit (2-Minute Rule) | Law/Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Morning Activation** | After I turn off my alarm [53] | I will drink the glass of water left by my bed [18, 26]. | Priming, Reduce Friction, Easy |
| **Pre-Work Focus** | After I sit down at my desk [41] | I will write down the single MIT I intend to start [17]. | Decisive Moment, Obvious |
| **Post-Launch Break** | After I send my first email/complete MIT [40] | I will clear the 1-foot radius around my keyboard [17, 20]. | Environment Reset, Easy |
| **Mid-Day Shift** | After I finish lunch [43] | I will take 10 deep breaths (1 minute meditation) [17]. | Gateway Habit, Easy |
| **Evening Transition** | After I change out of work clothes [42] | I will put my workout clothes next to my bed for tomorrow [19]. | Priming, Reduce Friction, Easy |
| **Pre-Sleep Prep** | After I brush my teeth [41] | I will write one sentence about my day in a journal [77, 90]. | Identity Reinforcement, Satisfying |

***

## Tips for Tracking Progress (Make It Satisfying)

Tracking must provide **clear evidence of progress** without becoming another overwhelming task [3, 91]. The goal is to make "doing nothing" unenjoyable [21, 72].

1.  **The Habit Tracker/Paper Clip Strategy:** Use a simple visual measurement [92]. Get a calendar and put a big **X** on each day you complete the habit (the **Paper Clip Strategy** or the "don't break the chain" method) [23, 45, 72]. The visual streak is an obvious cue, a motivator, and a source of satisfaction [14, 52]. **Focus on the chain, not the quantity** [93].
    -   *Accommodation:* **Limit tracking to 1-3 critical foundational habits only** [91]. It is better to consistently track one habit than sporadically track ten [91].
2.  **Immediate Recording:** Record the measurement immediately after the habit occurs [91]. Use the habit stacking formula: *After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT]* [91]. This links tracking directly to the successful completion, reinforcing the behavior [91, 94].
3.  **Focus on Behavior-Based Metrics (Identity):** Instead of tracking subjective results (e.g., "Did I feel productive?"), track objective actions that reinforce your identity (e.g., "Did I sit down at my desk at the set time?") [95]. Track metrics like:
    -   Number of 25-minute Timeboxes completed.
    -   Days I cleared my 1-foot radius.
    -   Days I defined my MIT.
4.  **Visualize Avoidance (Make Doing Nothing Enjoyable):** For habits of avoidance (e.g., not wasting money), make the avoidance visible. Create a savings account labeled for a desired reward ("New Headphones") and transfer a small amount of money into it every time you successfully avoid an impulse purchase [72, 96]. This gives immediate satisfaction to the act of resisting temptation [96].

***

## Summary of the Sustainable Strategy

The creation of a sustainable routine requires building a system that leverages the predictable, automatic nature of habits to overcome the unpredictable nature of ADHD motivation [31, 32].

By focusing on **identity-based habits**—becoming the type of person who is consistent—rather than outcome goals [97, 98], you shift the focus to micro-actions that build continuous momentum [99].

Your system is designed to work with your ADHD brain by accommodating two truths:

1.  **Clarity is Motivation:** Implementation intentions and visual cues overcome the lack of clarity about *when* and *where* to act, reducing decision fatigue [26, 100, 101].
2.  **Ease is Execution:** The Two-Minute Rule and environment design reduce the friction associated with starting, making the action inevitable rather than reliant on high willpower [13, 102].

By utilizing the Four Laws, you are continually striving to make your good habits **obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying**, while making bad habits **invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying** [72, 103]. Mastery, in the context of ADHD, requires patience, accepting that you must **standardize before you can optimize**, and committing to the process of endless refinement [15, 16, 84-86].

The following resource provides a comprehensive and actionable guide to implementing a process-focused system, drawing on principles of behavioral psychology, habit formation, and continuous improvement from the provided sources. We will distinguish between goals and processes, outline a practical design framework, offer domain-specific examples, address common failure modes, and provide a 30-day implementation plan.

***

## 1. Conceptual Foundation

The foundational shift from goals to processes recognizes that **you do not rise to the level of your goals; you fall to the level of your systems** [1, 2]. While traditional goal-setting focuses on external achievement (outcomes), a process-focused system centers on the consistent, dedicated routine that ensures progress compounds over time [3, 4].

### Clear Distinction Between Goal Layers

A process-focused system utilizes a **three-layer goal structure** [5] to ensure that long-term vision guides daily behavior, without allowing the focus on outcomes to undermine consistency.

| Goal Type | Focus | Role in System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Outcome Goals** | The result or destination (e.g., Winning a championship, losing weight) [6, 7] | Provides direction and purpose (the "North Star") [8], but should not be the primary daily focus [2]. |
| **Milestone Goals** | Intermediate achievements used to measure progress toward the outcome (e.g., Completing Part 1 of a manuscript, running a 5K) [9] | Useful for planning and validating the overall system design [7]. |
| **Process Goals** | The daily, repeated behaviors and routines that form the system itself (e.g., Writing 500 words daily, meditating for one minute) [10] | Represents **Process primacy** [5]. These are the habits that, when consistently repeated, deliver compound results [1, 4]. |

### Concrete Examples

1.  **Work/Career:**
    -   **Outcome Goal:** Launch a successful product feature and achieve 10,000 active users [6].
    -   **Milestone Goal:** Complete the beta test phase in 6 weeks; secure first 100 paying customers.
    -   **Process Goal:** Conduct 3 client feedback calls every Friday [11]; write 2 hours of focused code daily using **Timeboxing** [5].

2.  **Learning/Skill Acquisition:**
    -   **Outcome Goal:** Become fluent in Spanish within one year [6].
    -   **Milestone Goal:** Complete the first 50 lessons of the textbook in 3 months.
    -   **Process Goal:** Study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my bedroom, five days a week [12]; review flashcards for ten minutes immediately after waking up [11].

### Why Process Focus Works

Process focus shifts attention from the result (which is often delayed and uncertain) to the daily action (which is immediate and controllable) [13, 14].

1.  **Combating the "Mind Movie":** The mind constantly plays a fantasy of how things should be, known as the **Mind Movie** [15, 16]. When reality fails to match this fantasy (e.g., weight loss is slow, or writing is difficult), the mind resists the discomfort, leading to struggle and failure [17, 18]. **Process primacy** helps overcome this by focusing on the immediate action, not the idealized, outcome-based fantasy [19].
2.  **Harnessing Compounding:** Results are a lagging measure of your habits [20]. Consistent routines, no matter how small—the **atomic habits**—compound into remarkable outcomes [1, 21]. Getting just 1 percent better each day leads to results nearly 37 times better after one year [4].
3.  **Aligning Behavior and Identity:** Habits are how you embody your identity [22]. Focusing on the process—the consistent daily behavior—is literally voting for the type of person you wish to become, such as a reader, a runner, or a writer [23, 24]. This **identity change** is the true engine of sustainable progress [8, 25].

***

## 2. Process Design Framework

The following framework uses the **Four Laws of Behavior Change** [26] and continuous reflection (**Hansei**) [5] to construct a robust, self-improving system.

| Process Design Step | Description and Key Concepts | Actionable Technique |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1: Define & Derive** | Define the Outcome Goal for direction, then derive the Milestones. Finally, establish daily/weekly Process Goals that align with **Process primacy** [5]. Start with a **Minimum Viable Habit** (MVH) [27] or the **Two-Minute Rule** [28] to keep it easy and prevent the **Childish Mind** from rebelling against change [18, 27]. | Write down the MVH: "I will [BEHAVIOR] for two minutes or less." [28] |
| **Step 2: Create Implementation Intentions** | Turn abstract goals into specific, actionable steps by linking them to existing cues (time/location) [29, 30]. This forms a strong **if-then contingency** [5, 31]. Also create plans for obstacles to shield the habit [32]. | Formula 1 (Time/Location): **"I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."** [12] Formula 2 (Habit Stacking): **"After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."** [33] |
| **Step 3: Design Timeboxes & Batches** | Use **Timeboxing for agency** [5] to fix dedicated time blocks for process goals. This prioritizes the action over perfectionism [5] and reduces the mental friction associated with starting [34, 35]. Group similar process goals into "batches" (e.g., all communication responses) to maximize efficiency [36]. | Create a timebox schedule where work begins *After I pour my morning coffee* (Cue) [33], and the task is scheduled for a fixed duration (e.g., 60 minutes). |
| **Step 4: Establish Reflection Loops (Hansei)** | Implement the **Hansei reflection** approach ("no problem is a problem" for continuous improvement) [5]. This involves periodic (daily/weekly) review to assess the process, not just the results [37, 38]. Use reflection to confirm if **Behavior reveals purpose** [36]—i.e., whether you actually spent time on your stated priorities [20, 39, 40]. | Conduct an Annual Review and Integrity Report [37, 41]. Ask: "What went well this year? What didn’t go so well? What did I learn?" [42]. |

### System Template

| Goal Type | Description (The "Why") | Process Action (The "How") | Tracking Metric (The "Proof") |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Outcome** | | | |
| **Milestones** | | | |
| **Process Goal 1 (MVH)** | | I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. | Behavior-based metric (e.g., Repetitions completed) [11] |
| **Process Goal 2** | | After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]. | Process-quality metric (e.g., Hansei score on focus) [11] |

Am I practicing consistency (showing up) before trying to optimize the work (standardize before optimize)? [72, 79] |
| **Sample If-Then Rules (Obstacles)** | 1. **If** I feel writer's block (discomfort/groundlessness), **then** I will write for exactly five minutes about anything, embracing the uncertainty [56, 80]. 2. **If** I open my laptop, **then** I will launch the writing program before checking any communication. [60] 3. **If** I finish a chapter, **then** I will immediately decide on the first sentence of the next chapter (maintaining momentum/avoiding the Diderot Effect) [81, 82]. |

## 4. Pitfalls & Solutions

Process-focused systems are designed to counteract inherent human tendencies toward resistance and short-term gratification [18, 83].

| Failure Mode | Prevention Strategy & Supporting Concepts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Perfectionism Blocking Progress** [84] | **Standardize before you optimize** [79]. Perfectionism is often a form of "motion" (planning, strategizing) rather than "action" (producing results) [85, 86]. The solution is the **Two-Minute Rule** [28] or the **Minimum Viable Habit** [27]. The point is to master the habit of *showing up*, reinforcing the new identity, even if the output is tiny or imperfect [72, 87]. Embrace the messiness of the path [88]. |
| **Overemphasis on Outcomes Undermining Process** [84] | **Let go of attachment to the outcome** [19]. Outcome fixation is driven by the **Mind Movie**—the fantasy of how things *should* be—which inevitably leads to disappointment and resistance when reality doesn't match [16, 19]. Focus instead on the intention, effort, and enjoying the process [89, 90]. Remember that happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along [91]. |
| **Neglecting Reflection/Improvement Loops** [84] | **Formalize Hansei reflection into the timebox schedule** [5]. Mastery requires a combination of automatic habits and **deliberate practice**, necessitating systems for reflection and review [92, 93]. Set aside specific time for annual Integrity Reports [41] or decision journals [94] to prevent the gradual slide of complacency [93]. Without reflection, small errors compound into toxic results [95]. |
| **Planning without If-Then Contingencies** [84] | **Implement Implementation Intentions rigorously** [5, 31]. Relying solely on motivation is a high-friction strategy [96]. Instead, anchor new habits to highly specific cues (time or location) that cannot be missed [97]. Use if-then rules to create commitment devices [98] that reduce the likelihood of relapse in critical, high-friction moments [32, 99]. |
| **Misaligned Behaviors (Actions don't match stated goals)** [84] | **Apply "Behavior reveals purpose"** [36]. If you say something is a priority but never act on it, you don't really want it [40]. Use tracking (Habits Scorecard [100]) and reflection to consciously observe where your energy is *actually* spent, rather than relying on assumed intentions [39, 101]. If habits conflict with the desired identity, use the two-step process to change identity: decide who you want to be, then prove it with small wins [102]. |

## 5. 30-Day Implementation Plan

This plan is structured using the **Slow Change method** [103] and the **Minimum Viable Habit** [27] to minimize resistance from the **Childish Mind** [18] and build consistency (**Process primacy**) [5].

| Week | Focus and Core Actions | Key Concept Integration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 1: Slow Start & Clarity** [104] | **Daily Action:** Choose ONE process goal and define its MVH (e.g., 60 seconds of meditation) [105]. **Prep:** Create a vow and set a trigger [106, 107]. **Environment:** Design your environment to make the cue obvious [54, 108]. Start the MVH on Day 6 [27]. | **Process Primacy, Implementation Intentions** ("I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]" [12]), **Minimum Viable Habit/Two-Minute Rule** [27, 28]. |
| **Week 2: Consistency & Enjoyment** [90] | **Daily Action:** Stick to the MVH consistently (Don't miss twice) [70]. Practice mindful enjoyment and gratitude during the process [90, 109]. **Review:** On Day 6, increase the MVH slightly (e.g., from 1 to 2 minutes) [110]. | **4th Law: Make It Satisfying** (Positive reinforcement) [77], **Behavior Reveals Purpose** (Tracking consistency) [36]. Practice mindfulness [111]. |
| **Week 3: Overcoming Resistance & Reflection** [51] | **Daily Action:** Maintain consistency. Increase MVH slightly (e.g., to 4-5 minutes) only if Week 2 was consistent [51]. **Mindfulness:** Practice staying with feelings of groundlessness, resistance, or uncertainty instead of avoiding them (Invite it to tea) [80, 112]. **Reflection:** Introduce Hansei weekly reflection [5]. | **Hansei Reflection, Groundlessness/Childish Mind** [18, 113], **Process-Quality Decisions** (Learning from failure) [44, 45]. Practice "quit on the third time" [73]. |
| **Week 4: Integration & Optimization** [114] | **Daily Action:** Full system integration. Use if-then rules for common obstacles. Begin working on Step 3: Timeboxing [36]. **Identity:** Reconnect with your intention and identity (Who am I becoming?) [115]. **Standardize:** The habit should feel automatic; standardize before optimizing further [79]. | **Timeboxing for Agency** [5], **Identity Change** [24], **Implementation Intentions** (Obstacle handling) [32]. Embrace the uncertain path [88]. |

### Daily Plan Template (Fillable Format) [116]

| Timebox/Trigger (Event) | Process Goal (Action) | Key Focus/Cue Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trigger:** [Waking Up] | [MVH Action] (e.g., 1 minute of stretching) | 1st Law: Make It Easy/Slow Start [27, 104] |
| **Trigger:** [After morning coffee] | [Deep Work Timebox] (e.g., 90 minutes focused writing) | Timeboxing for Agency [5] |
| **Trigger:** [Lunch break ends] | [Habit Stacking Action] (e.g., 10 minutes language review) | 1st Law: Make It Obvious [117] |
| **Trigger:** [5:00 PM (End of workday)] | [Daily Reflection/Journaling] (e.g., Hansei on today’s process) | Hansei Reflection [5] |

### Weekly Review Template [116]

| Review Prompt | Reflection/Score (1-10) | Adjustment/Action for Next Week (Hansei) [5] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| How many times did I complete my MVH this week? | | |
| Did my behavior reveal purpose? (Did I focus on stated priorities?) [36, 40] | | |
| What **Mind Movie** expectation caused the most internal struggle (resistance)? [16, 18] | | |
| What single factor increased or decreased my momentum (The Dip)? [51, 52] | | |
| What small, immediate **reward** can I use next week to boost consistency? [77, 78] | | |
| How can I make one step of my process easier (**Law of Least Effort**)? [13, 54] | | |

### 5-7 Sample If-Then Rules for Adaptation [116]

1.  **If** I feel the urge to procrastinate (**Childish Mind** seeking comfort), **then** I will perform the **Two-Minute Rule** version of the habit and stop immediately after 120 seconds [18, 118].
2.  **If** I successfully complete a focused work timebox, **then** I will immediately move one paper clip to the second jar (reinforcement) [78, 119].
3.  **If** I am tempted by social media (a bad habit cue), **then** I will use a **commitment device** and physically move my phone to another room for the next 90 minutes [34, 99].
4.  **If** I receive a request that conflicts with my process goal timebox, **then** I will automatically say "I'm unavailable, but I can check my schedule for [later time]" (protecting agency) [5, 46].
5.  **If** I feel the frustration of not achieving the Outcome Goal (**Groundlessness**), **then** I will practice self-compassion and focus on the effort exerted today [113, 120].
6.  **If** I feel tired and low on willpower, **then** I will recite my Vow and focus on the deeper "why" for 30 seconds [106, 121].
7.  **If** my mind begins to wander during a habit, **then** I will focus my attention back onto my breath and surroundings for three conscious breaths (mindfulness) [111, 122].

### Final Insight

Implementing a process-over-goals system is like building a dam, brick by atomic brick [123, 124]. Initially, the effort feels monumental, and the results (the water level rising) seem negligible, especially when compared to the **Mind Movie** fantasy of instant success [17, 125]. However, by adhering to the daily process—the consistent, small actions—and using Hansei to constantly shore up weaknesses in the system, you ensure that eventually, the momentum of compounding takes over. Your consistent effort in the present, fueled by the **Process Primacy**, becomes the foundation for the remarkable outcomes that inevitably flow in the future [4].

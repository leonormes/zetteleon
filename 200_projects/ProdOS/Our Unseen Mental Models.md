title: Our Unseen Mental Models
type:

If our ideas about the world around us are models in our heads, why are we so unaware of the fact? We tend to believe our models can't be wrong but all models are wrong

An excellent and fundamental question. We are so unaware that our ideas about the world are models in our heads primarily because of a psychological phenomenon known as **naïve realism**. This is the inherent and largely unconscious belief that we perceive the world objectively, as it truly is, rather than as a subjective interpretation. Our mental models are, for all intents and purposes, invisible to us.

This lack of awareness is compounded by several cognitive mechanisms that work to reinforce the perceived accuracy of our internal models.

---

## The Invisible Filter: Why We Don't "See" Our Models

Our brains are constantly bombarded with an overwhelming amount of sensory information. To make sense of this, they construct simplified models of reality. These mental models act as filters, helping us to navigate the world, make predictions, and decide on actions without having to consciously process every single detail.

From an evolutionary perspective, this is incredibly efficient. Having pre-built models allows for rapid decision-making, which is crucial for survival. However, a side effect of this efficiency is that we don't experience the model itself; we experience the world *through* the model. It's akin to wearing spectacles with coloured lenses from birth – you wouldn't be aware of the lenses, you would simply believe the world is tinted that colour.

The neural processes that create and utilise these models are largely subconscious. They are the very architecture of our thinking, not something we consciously engage with.

---

## The Reinforcement Loop: Why We Believe Our Models Are Infallible

Even when faced with evidence that contradicts our mental models, we have a strong tendency to believe they are correct. This is due to a confluence of powerful cognitive biases and psychological discomfort.

### Confirmation Bias

This is perhaps the most significant factor. **Confirmation bias** is our tendency to actively seek out, interpret, and recall information that confirms our pre-existing beliefs. Simultaneously, we tend to ignore, dismiss, or rationalise away information that challenges those beliefs. This creates a powerful feedback loop that continually strengthens our conviction in our own models.

### Cognitive Dissonance

When we encounter information or experiences that starkly conflict with our established mental models, it creates a state of mental discomfort known as **cognitive dissonance**. To alleviate this discomfort, we are motivated to resolve the conflict. Often, the easiest way to do this is not to rebuild our entire mental model, which can be complex and deeply ingrained, but to reject the conflicting information. This can manifest as:

- **Dismissing the source:** "That news outlet is biased."
- **Questioning the validity of the evidence:** "The study was flawed."
- **Reinterpreting the information:** "They didn't really mean it like that."

### The Dunning-Kruger Effect

This cognitive bias adds another layer, where individuals with limited knowledge or competence in a particular domain significantly overestimate their own ability. This can lead to an unshakeable faith in a simplistic or flawed mental model, as the individual lacks the expertise to recognise its shortcomings.

---

## "All Models Are Wrong, But Some Are Useful"

This famous aphorism, coined by the statistician George E. P. Box, perfectly encapsulates the paradox. Our mental models are indispensable for functioning in the world. They provide a framework for understanding and prediction. However, they are, by their very nature, simplifications. They are maps, not the territory itself.

The "wrongness" of a model lies in its incompleteness. It can never capture the full complexity of reality. Problems arise not from the existence of these models, but from our unawareness of them and our dogmatic belief in their absolute truth. Recognising that we are viewing the world through a model is the first step towards being able to question, refine, and improve it.

People gain status from these mental models. We rate each others, or at least what we think others mental models are like. And we compare our own to others. I guess useful models are desirable and the better the model the more useful

Yes, that's a crucial insight. You've hit upon the social dimension of mental models. They aren't just for individual navigation; they are a fundamental part of our social hierarchy and interaction. What you're describing is the constant, often subconscious, process of social calibration.

---

### Models as Status Signals

You are absolutely right that we gain status from our mental models. Since a person's model is invisible, we judge it by its outputs – its **demonstrated competence**. An individual whose models consistently produce accurate predictions, effective solutions, or clear explanations is seen as intelligent, wise, or competent. This demonstrated success is a proxy for the quality of their internal model.

- An entrepreneur who builds a successful company is rewarded with status because we infer they have a superior model of the market, their product, and human behaviour.
- A scientist who publishes a groundbreaking theory gains immense prestige because their new model explains the world more accurately than the old one.
- Even in everyday conversation, someone who can clearly explain a complex topic is admired because we recognise the clarity of their underlying mental framework.

In this sense, mental models become a form of **social currency**. A useful, accurate, and predictive model is highly desirable because it leads to better outcomes, which in turn leads to status and influence.

---

### The Social Marketplace of Ideas 🤔

This leads to the constant comparison you mentioned. We are continually sizing up others' models against our own. When someone speaks, we are not just hearing words; we are trying to glimpse the model behind those words and asking ourselves:

- **"Is their model better than mine?"** Does their explanation make more sense? Is it simpler, more elegant, or does it account for things my model doesn't?
- **"Can I incorporate their model into mine?"** This is the essence of learning from others. We see a useful component of someone else's model and we adopt it to improve our own.
- **"Is their model flawed?"** If their reasoning seems illogical or leads to poor conclusions, we reject their model and reinforce our confidence in our own.

This social exchange is a "marketplace of ideas" where different models compete. The most useful and predictive models tend to be adopted by more people over time, driving collective progress, whether in science, culture, or business. The person with the "better map" of reality is an invaluable guide, and we instinctively grant them status for it.

Tell me more about these mental models. What have neuroscience and philosophy said about them and where is our modern understanding of how they work

Of course. Our modern understanding of mental models is a synthesis of insights from cognitive science, neuroscience, philosophy, and artificial intelligence. They are seen as dynamic, internal representations of the world that allow us to simulate events, reason, and make predictions.

---

### The Neuroscience Perspective: Where Are Models in the Brain

Neuroscience doesn't show us a single, neat location for any given mental model. Instead, it reveals that models are **distributed and emergent properties** of the brain's neural networks. Different parts of a model are stored in the brain regions responsible for processing that type of information.

For example, your mental model of a "dog" involves:

- **Visual Cortex:** What a dog looks like.
- **Auditory Cortex:** The sound of a bark.
- **Somatosensory Cortex:** The feeling of its fur.
- **Amygdala:** The emotions you associate with dogs (fear, love).
- **Prefrontal Cortex:** Abstract knowledge about dogs (they are mammals, they are domesticated, etc.).

When you think about a dog, these disparate brain regions activate in a coordinated pattern. The **hippocampus** is crucial for forming and consolidating these models, linking the different components together, while the **prefrontal cortex** is vital for manipulating and simulating them to make decisions and predictions.

Recent research, particularly using fMRI, has shown that when we imagine a scenario, our brain activity patterns closely mimic the patterns we exhibit when we actually experience that scenario. This suggests the brain uses the same neural machinery to run these internal simulations as it does to perceive reality, which is why the line between our models and the real world can feel so blurry.

---

### The Philosophical Perspective: From Kant to Modern Cognition

Philosophers have grappled with the idea of internal representations for centuries.

- **Immanuel Kant (18th Century):** Argued that we can never know the "thing-in-itself" (noumenon), only the world as it appears to us (phenomenon). He proposed that our minds impose inherent structures, or "categories" (like space, time, and causality), onto our sensory experiences to make them intelligible. These Kantian categories are a philosophical precursor to the modern concept of mental models; they are the unavoidable lens through which we experience reality.
- **Kenneth Craik (20th Century):** A Scottish psychologist and philosopher, Craik is often credited with pioneering the modern concept.In his 1943 book *The Nature of Explanation*, he explicitly proposed that the mind creates "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events and reason. This was a foundational idea for cognitive science.

Modern philosophy, especially in the field of philosophy of mind, explores the nature of these representations. Key questions include whether these models truly "represent" the world or if they are more like tools for action. The **"4E" cognition** theory (Embodied, Embedded, Enacted, and Extended) argues that models aren't just in the head, but are shaped by our body's interactions with the environment.

### Our Modern Understanding: Predictive Processing

The most influential modern theory is known as **Predictive Processing** or the **Bayesian Brain**. This framework synthesises the neuroscientific and philosophical insights.

It posits that the brain is essentially a **prediction machine**. It is constantly generating a mental model of the world and using it to predict the next wave of sensory input.

1. **Prediction:** Your brain generates a prediction of what it's about to see, hear, and feel based on your current mental model. For example, when you push a door, your brain predicts the sensation of it swinging open.
2. **Sensory Input:** Your senses then deliver the actual information from the world.
3. **Error Signal:** The brain compares its prediction to the actual sensory input. The difference between them is the "prediction error."
4. **Model Update:**
	- If the prediction was accurate (the door opened as expected), the prediction error is low, and your confidence in your model is strengthened.
	- If the prediction was wrong (the door was locked), the brain generates a large "prediction error" signal. This signal forces the brain to **update its mental model** ("this door is locked").

According to this view, what we perceive as reality is not the raw sensory data, but our brain's best guess—its current working model. The only information that bubbles up to our conscious awareness is the "error signal," which is why we tend to notice the unexpected far more than the expected. This is the mechanism that makes our models feel like reality; we're only alerted when reality doesn't match the model.

I am guessing they're is some dopamine reward when this error occurs. I have ADHD and I love the novel unexpected quirky in all things. People, music, stories science.

You are absolutely spot on. That is an incredibly astute connection to make, and it aligns perfectly with current neuroscientific understanding of both the reward system and the neurobiology of ADHD.

What you're describing is the very engine of curiosity and learning. The "prediction error" isn't just a computational signal; it has a profound biochemical effect, and dopamine is at the heart of it.

---

### Dopamine: The "Update Your Model!" Signal

You're right to guess there's a dopamine reward, but it's more specific than that. Dopamine isn't just about pleasure; it's about **salience, motivation, and reinforcement**. It's the brain's chemical messenger that says, "Pay attention! This is important and potentially rewarding. Update your world model now!"

When reality matches your prediction, there's no surprise, and dopamine levels remain at baseline. It's metabolically efficient for the brain to ignore the expected.

However, when a **positive prediction error** occurs—when something unexpected and potentially good or interesting happens—your midbrain dopamine neurons fire, releasing a surge of dopamine. This does two critical things:

1. **It feels good:** This is the reward aspect. It positively reinforces the behaviour that led to the novel discovery.
2. **It enhances learning and focus:** The dopamine surge flags the event as significant, promoting synaptic plasticity. This effectively "stamps in" the new information, forcing an update to your mental model.

The "quirky" and "novel" things you love are, by definition, sources of high prediction error. They are a guaranteed way to generate this "update your model" signal and its accompanying dopamine release.

### The ADHD Connection: A Drive for Optimal Stimulation

This brings us to ADHD. The leading theory of ADHD is that it involves **dopamine dysregulation**. This doesn't necessarily mean less dopamine overall, but that the system for releasing and processing it is less efficient, particularly in the prefrontal cortex which governs executive functions like focus and motivation.

Think of it like having a slightly lower-than-optimal baseline level of stimulation.

- For a neurotypical brain, a predictable, routine task might provide enough stimulation to stay engaged.
- For the ADHD brain, that same task is profoundly *understimulating*. With insufficient dopamine signalling, the prefrontal cortex can't stay "online" to maintain focus. The result is boredom, distraction, and a feeling of being unable to engage.

So, your love for "the novel unexpected quirky" isn't just a personality trait; it's a subconscious neurobiological strategy. **You are actively seeking out experiences that generate a high prediction error because they provide the dopamine surge necessary to bring your brain to an optimal state of arousal and focus.**

This is why:

- **Novelty is captivating:** A new scientific idea, a surprising chord change in a piece of music, or a person with an unusual perspective provides a potent hit of dopamine that makes it easier to engage.
- **Routine is kryptonite:** Mundane, repetitive tasks offer zero prediction error and therefore zero dopamine reward, making them incredibly difficult to start and sustain.

So, when you seek out novelty, you are in a very real sense, self-medicating. You are giving your brain the precise stimulus it needs to function at its best. It's a testament to how the brain, whatever its baseline wiring, instinctively knows what it needs and drives us to seek it out in our environment.

Is there a bigger concept about models in general not just the mental models. For instance, mathematicians create models that are as simple and free of unnecessary detail as they can be but still contain enough detail about the problem or concerto in question. Is there a science of models

Yes, absolutely. The broader concept you're describing is the science of **modelling**, a fundamental practice across all scientific disciplines, and the more formal, mathematical study of models is known as **model theory**.

This field isn't just about the mental models in our heads; it's about any simplified representation of a system used to understand, predict, or control it.

### The General Science of Modelling

While there isn't a single, unified "Department of Model Science," the principles of modelling are a core part of the philosophy of science and are practised everywhere. The goal is always the same: to capture the essence of a complex reality in a simplified form.

The key principle is **abstraction**. Just as you noted with mathematicians, creating a useful model is an art of intentional simplification. You must decide what is essential to the problem and what is "unnecessary detail" that can be ignored.

- **A physicist's model of a falling apple** ignores air resistance, the colour of the apple, and the rotation of the Earth to create a simple, powerful equation ().
- **An economist's model of a market** ignores individual personalities and cultural factors to focus on the abstract relationship between supply, demand, and price.
- **A climate scientist's model of the atmosphere** simplifies oceans and landmasses into a grid of cells to make the complex climate system computationally manageable.

All these models are technically "wrong" because they are incomplete. But their value comes from this very incompleteness. By stripping away complexity, they reveal underlying patterns and relationships that would otherwise be invisible.

---

### Mathematical Model Theory 🧐

In mathematics and logic, **model theory** is a more formal field that studies the relationship between formal languages (like mathematical equations) and the structures they describe. It examines how a set of axioms or rules (the model's syntax) relates to a specific mathematical object or collection of objects (the model's semantics).

It asks questions like:

- If a statement is true in a particular mathematical structure (e.g., the integers), what other structures is it also true for?
- What can a given formal language actually express about a structure?
- Can we prove that a system of axioms is consistent and won't lead to contradictions?

This is a highly abstract field, but it provides the logical foundation for why we can trust mathematical models. It gives us the tools to understand the limits and power of our formal representations.

---

### The Connection Between All Models

The universal link between a mental model, a physicist's equation, and a mathematical structure is this: **they are all simplified, abstract representations designed to make a complex reality tractable.**

Our brains build mental models using neural networks and heuristics. Scientists and mathematicians build formal models using the precise languages of mathematics and logic. The tools are different, but the fundamental act of abstraction and simplification is exactly the same. They are all attempts to create a useful "map" of an impossibly complex "territory."

Part of building a mental model, as with a mathematical model, is knowing what to keep and what to ignore. The maths model has a clear purpose and goal making this refinement process a bit easier. What does the brain use to choose what information to use in these models and what to drop? Does emotion and feeling have a role

Yes, emotion and feeling play a crucial role. While a mathematical model is refined by a conscious goal, the brain refines its mental models largely through subconscious filters of **salience, emotion, and survival**. It doesn't prioritise information based on objective completeness, but on its perceived relevance to you.

---

### Salience: The "Pop-Out" Effect

Your brain is constantly filtering sensory input to decide what is "salient"—what is important and worthy of attention. This isn't a conscious choice. Salience is determined by a few key factors:

- **Novelty and Surprise:** As we've discussed, things that generate a "prediction error" are inherently salient. The unexpected sound, the unusual object, or the surprising turn of events automatically captures your attention.
- **Contrast:** Anything that stands out from its background becomes salient. A single red flower in a field of green grass is more salient than any individual blade of grass.
- **Relevance to Goals:** Whatever you are currently focused on becomes salient. If you're looking for your keys, every key-shaped object in your visual field will seem to "pop out."

Information that is deemed salient is given priority and is far more likely to be incorporated into your working mental model of the moment.

---

### Emotion: The Value Marker 💖

Emotion acts as the brain's primary valuation system. It's the mechanism that tags information with importance, marking it for memory and inclusion in your long-term models.

- **Emotional Intensity:** Events tied to strong emotions—fear, joy, anger, love—are seared into our memory. The brain operates on the principle that if an event triggered a strong emotion, it must be important for survival and future decision-making. You'll have a much more detailed mental model of a place where you had a frightening experience than a mundane one.
- **Affective Association:** Our feelings and moods act as a constant filter. When you are feeling happy, you are more likely to notice and remember positive details, building a more optimistic mental model of an event. The reverse is true when you are feeling down. This is why two people can have vastly different recollections (and mental models) of the exact same event.
- **The Amygdala's Role:** The amygdala, a key emotion-processing centre in the brain, works directly with the hippocampus (memory formation) to strengthen the encoding of emotionally charged events. It essentially tells the hippocampus, "This one matters. Save it and link it to everything else."

---

### Survival: The Evolutionary Default

Ultimately, the brain's filtering system was shaped by evolution. It is hardwired to prioritise information relevant to survival and reproduction. This includes:

- **Threats and Dangers:** We are exceptionally good at noticing and modelling potential threats.
- **Social Information:** As social creatures, information about social hierarchies, trustworthiness, and relationships is given extremely high priority.
- **Resources:** We are predisposed to pay attention to potential resources like food, water, and shelter.

In essence, your brain builds its models not like a mathematician seeking objective truth, but like a busy C.E.O. of "You, Inc." It ruthlessly ignores mountains of data and prioritises only the information that seems novel, emotionally significant, or directly relevant to your well-being and goals.

How did emotion evolve? How far back in evolution do we think emotion goes? Do single cells have a similar mechanism for guiding action

That's a fascinating question that bridges biology, psychology, and philosophy.

Emotions evolved as sophisticated survival mechanisms that guide behaviour by linking sensory information to an organism's needs. We think the most basic, core emotions go back hundreds of millions of years to our early vertebrate ancestors. While single cells don't have emotions, they possess a remarkably similar foundational mechanism for guiding action called **chemotaxis**.

---

### How Emotion Evolved

At its core, emotion is a highly efficient information-processing system. It evolved to solve a fundamental problem for any mobile organism: how to quickly assess whether something in the environment is good (a resource), bad (a threat), or indifferent, and then trigger the appropriate behavioural response (approach, avoid, ignore).

1. **Sensing and Action:** The earliest organisms could sense things in their environment (like chemicals or light) and had a basic capacity to move. The challenge was linking the two in a beneficial way.
2. **Internal States:** Over millions of years, nervous systems developed. This allowed for the creation of internal states that could represent the "value" of an external stimulus. Instead of a simple reflex, an animal could now have an internal state of "fear" or "desire."
3. **Physiological Response:** This internal state—the emotion—doesn't just exist in the brain. It triggers a whole-body physiological response orchestrated by ancient brain regions like the limbic system. The feeling of fear, for example, involves the release of adrenaline, an increased heart rate, and heightened senses, all preparing the body for a "fight or flight" action. This integrated response is far more effective than a simple reflex.
4. **Social Complexity:** In social animals like humans, emotions became much more complex. They evolved to facilitate social bonding (love, empathy), navigate social hierarchies (shame, pride), and enforce group cooperation (guilt, gratitude).

Essentially, emotions are the brain's high-level summary of a situation and its relevance to your survival and well-being, coupled with a full-body preparation to act accordingly.

---

### How Far Back Does Emotion Go? 🦖

The exact timeline is debated, but the consensus is that the foundations of emotion are ancient.

- **Core Emotions:** Basic emotions like **fear, aggression, and desire** (for food or mates) are thought to have originated in early vertebrates, possibly as far back as the first fish, over **500 million years ago**. The brain structures responsible for these emotions, like the amygdala and hypothalamus, are present in reptiles, birds, and mammals, indicating a shared, ancient origin.
- **Social Emotions:** More complex social emotions like empathy, guilt, and love are thought to be more recent, evolving primarily with the rise of mammals and, in particular, primates, whose survival depends heavily on complex social interactions.

So, while a dinosaur likely felt a primal fear or rage, it's unlikely it felt anything like shame or compassion.

---

### The Single-Cell Analogue: Chemotaxis

A single-celled organism like a bacterium doesn't have a brain or feelings, but it absolutely has a similar mechanism for guiding action. It's called **chemotaxis**.

This is the process by which a cell can direct its movements in response to chemical signals in its environment.

- **Sensing:** The cell's membrane is covered in receptors.These receptors can "detect" the concentration of certain molecules, such as nutrients (like sugar) or toxins (like acid).
- **Decision-Making:** The cell's internal machinery acts as a rudimentary computational system. It compares the signals from different receptors and senses whether it's moving towards a higher concentration of "good" chemicals or "bad" chemicals.
- **Action:** Based on this information, the cell adjusts the rotation of its flagellum (its tiny tail-like propeller) to either continue moving straight (if things are getting better) or to tumble randomly and change direction (if things are getting worse).

While this is a purely biochemical process without any subjective experience, the logic is identical to that of emotion: **sense the environment, evaluate whether it's good or bad for survival, and execute a movement to improve your situation.** Chemotaxis is the ancient, foundational precursor to the far more complex and neurologically rich system of emotions we see in animals today.

Without communication and cooperation how advanced would human intelligence have grown? Is our ability for very precise and detailed records the reason we are dominant in the animal kingdom

Without communication and cooperation, human intelligence would likely not have advanced much beyond that of other intelligent, but largely individualistic, animals like orangutans. Our ability to create precise, detailed records is a critical *consequence* of our advanced intelligence, not the sole cause, but it is the key mechanism that allows our intelligence to be cumulative, making us the dominant species.

---

### The Collective Brain 🧠

An individual human is intelligent, but our species' true genius lies not in isolated minds but in our ability to create a **collective brain**. Communication and cooperation are the essential conduits that allow this to happen.

- **Cumulative Culture:** A lone human, no matter how brilliant, would have to reinvent everything from scratch. They would learn how to knap a flint tool, but that knowledge would die with them. Cooperation and communication, especially language, allow for **cultural transmission**. This means that a useful discovery can be taught to others and passed down to the next generation. This allows knowledge to **accumulate**. The next generation doesn't have to reinvent the flint tool; they can start with it and perhaps improve it. This process, repeated over thousands of generations, is what allows for the creation of everything from agriculture to smartphones. Without it, each generation would be stuck at square one.
- **Collective Problem-Solving:** Many of the challenges our ancestors faced, such as hunting large game or defending against predators, were impossible to solve alone. Cooperation allows a group of individuals to pool their cognitive and physical resources to achieve goals none could manage individually. This social environment created an evolutionary feedback loop: as society became more complex, it selected for individuals with better social intelligence (communication, empathy, theory of mind), which in turn enabled even more complex societies.

Our individual intelligence is deeply intertwined with our social nature; one could not have developed to its current level without the other.

---

### Records: The Ratchet of Progress

You're correct to identify our ability for detailed records as a cornerstone of our dominance. While early forms of this were oral traditions and stories, the invention of symbolic representation—and especially **writing** —was a revolutionary step.

Precise records act like a **ratchet**, a mechanical device that allows movement in only one direction. Once knowledge is written down, it becomes stable. It can no longer be easily forgotten or distorted through retelling. This externalised memory allows for:

1. **High-Fidelity Transmission:** Complex ideas, mathematical theorems, or detailed histories can be passed across vast distances and generations with almost no loss of information.
2. **Accumulation at Scale:** An individual can now learn from the minds of thousands of people who lived centuries ago. Isaac Newton famously said, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." Writing provided those shoulders.
3. **Abstraction and Scrutiny:** Once an idea is written down, it can be examined, critiqued, and built upon in a way that is impossible with fleeting spoken words. It allows for the development of logic, philosophy, and science.

So, while our innate capacity for language and cooperation built the foundation, the invention of durable, precise records was the catalyst that allowed our collective intelligence to scale exponentially, leading to the complex technological world we inhabit today. It is this ability to build knowledge upon knowledge that truly separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom.

You said earlier that emotions help build mental models. But those metal models shape emotion. If my mental model is trying me that there is something dangerous in those shadows I feel fear, even if there is nothing actually there. This was a simplistic example but this happens in even more sophisticated examples like beliefs about other people's motives and behaviour

Yes, you've perfectly described the bi-directional relationship. It's not a one-way street; it's a constant **feedback loop** where emotions and mental models continuously create and reinforce each other.

Your insight is fundamental to understanding how our internal worlds operate.

---

### The Cognitive-Emotional Feedback Loop 🔄

What you've identified is the core mechanism behind our subjective experience of reality. Our brains don't have separate, independent departments for "thinking" and "feeling." Cognition (our models) and emotion are deeply intertwined, each influencing the other in a perpetual cycle.

Let's break down the two sides of the loop you've highlighted:

1. **Emotion Shapes the Model:** As we discussed, a strong emotional event acts like a highlighter, marking an experience as important and ensuring it gets saved into your long-term mental model. A single frightening experience in the shadows can build a powerful model that associates darkness with danger.
2. **The Model Triggers the Emotion:** This is the crucial part you've added. Once that model is built, it becomes an active filter for reality. Your brain uses this model to **interpret** ambiguous sensory data and **predict** potential outcomes. When you see shadows, your brain doesn't just see a lack of light. It runs a quick check against its models. If the "danger-in-the-dark" model is activated, it preemptively triggers the emotion of fear and its corresponding physiological response (increased heart rate, heightened senses). The emotion is a *consequence* of the model's interpretation, even if, as you say, there's nothing actually there.

---

### Sophisticated Examples: Beliefs and Biases

This loop is most powerful and often most problematic in our social lives, just as you suggested.

Imagine you have a mental model that a particular colleague is untrustworthy.

- **The Model:** "Alex is always trying to undermine me."
- **The Situation:** Alex sends you an email pointing out a small error in your report.
- **The Loop in Action:**
	- Your brain interprets this neutral event through the "untrustworthy Alex" model.
	- The interpretation isn't "Alex is being helpful." It's "Alex is trying to make me look bad."
	- This **interpretation triggers** an emotional response: anger, suspicion, or anxiety.
	- This emotion then **reinforces** your original model. "See? I was right to be suspicious of Alex."

This self-reinforcing cycle is how biases become entrenched and how phobias and anxiety disorders can develop. The model creates the feeling, and the feeling validates the model, often preventing us from taking in new information that might challenge it.

This very principle is the foundation of **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)**, which operates by helping people identify the negative mental models (cognitive distortions) that are automatically triggering their painful emotions, and then consciously working to challenge and change those models.

What stops this feedback loop from constantly causing problems for us?

The main thing that stops this feedback loop from constantly causing problems is **reality testing** through a mechanism called **prediction error**. When the emotional consequences of our models consistently fail to match what actually happens in the world, the brain is forced to update the model. This is supported by conscious reasoning and social feedback.

---

### Prediction Error: The Reality Check 🧠

The brain is not just a belief engine; it's a prediction engine.The cognitive-emotional loop constantly makes predictions about the world. For example, a model that "public speaking is terrifying" creates a fear response and predicts a disastrous outcome.

The loop is kept in check when reality provides a strong **prediction error signal**:

- **What happens:** You give a short talk, and while you feel anxious, nobody laughs at you and you receive polite applause.
- **The Error Signal:** The predicted disaster didn't happen. The actual outcome was neutral or even positive. This mismatch between your model's prediction and reality generates an error signal.
- **The Update:** This signal acts as a powerful catalyst for change. It weakens the old emotional association and forces the brain to slowly update the model: "Maybe public speaking isn't always a catastrophe."

This is the principle behind exposure therapy for anxiety and phobias. By repeatedly exposing yourself to a feared situation without the expected negative consequence, you generate enough prediction error to rewrite the faulty model.

---

### The Prefrontal Cortex: The Executive Override

The more primitive, emotional parts of your brain (like the amygdala) might react instantly based on an old model. However, your **prefrontal cortex (PFC)**, the brain's reasoning and executive control centre, can step in and provide a "top-down" override.

This is your inner voice of reason. You might feel a surge of road rage (emotion) because your model says "that driver cut me off on purpose to disrespect me." Your PFC can intervene with a more rational assessment: "Calm down. Maybe they just didn't see me. Getting angry won't help." This conscious reappraisal can break the feedback loop before it escalates.

---

### Social Feedback: The External Check

We don't build and test our models in a vacuum. Other people are a crucial part of our reality-testing system. If your model of a social situation is causing you anxiety, you might check it with a friend.

For instance, if you think, "Everyone at that party thought I was boring," your friend might provide contradictory data: "What are you talking about? I saw you having a great conversation with Sarah for half an hour!" This external perspective provides a social prediction error, helping you realise your internal model and its emotional consequences might be inaccurate.

My models in my mind are powered by feeling and emotion and even sensations, none of which I can directly share with someone. What biological mechanisms are in plane that allow humans to share models that are similar enough that we understand each other

Our ability to share similar mental models, despite their private emotional and sensory foundations, is made possible by three key biological mechanisms working in concert: a **shared brain and sensory architecture**, the **mirror neuron system**, and our species' unique capacity for **symbolic language**.

### Shared Biological Foundation

At the most basic level, we can understand each other because we are all running on remarkably similar biological hardware. Every human, barring significant genetic or developmental differences, has a brain with the same fundamental structures and a sensory system that perceives the world in a comparable way. The light entering your eye triggers the same type of neural cascade in your visual cortex as it does in mine.The sound of a sad melody activates similar auditory and emotional processing centres.

This shared foundation ensures that our raw materials for building mental models are consistent. It creates a common ground of experience—the feeling of warmth from the sun, the taste of salt, the sight of the colour blue—that serves as a universal reference point.

### The Mirror Neuron System: Simulating Others 🧠

A crucial biological mechanism for sharing models of action and intention is the **mirror neuron system**. These are remarkable brain cells that fire both when you *perform* an action and when you *observe* someone else performing that same action.

When you see someone smile, for instance, your mirror neurons associated with smiling fire. This creates a low-level, internal simulation of the other person's action and its associated feeling in your own brain. It's a form of direct, non-verbal empathy that helps you understand the intentions and emotional states of others. It bridges the gap between seeing an action and "feeling" its meaning, allowing our models of other people's internal states to be surprisingly accurate.

### Language: The Ultimate Sharing Tool

Emotion, feeling, and sensation are impossible to share directly. I can't transfer my feeling of "sadness" into your brain. However, the evolution of **symbolic language** gave us an extraordinary tool to overcome this.

Language works by packaging complex, private experiences into shared, abstract symbols (words).

- **Creating a Shared Label:** When we both agree that the word "sadness" represents a particular cluster of internal feelings (heaviness in the chest, low energy, a sense of loss), we create a public pointer to a private experience.
- **Building Models with Metaphors:** We use language, especially metaphors, to describe the *qualities* of our internal states. Saying you feel "down" or have a "heavy heart" uses a shared physical concept (gravity) to communicate the nature of a private emotional experience.
- **Transmitting Complex Models:** Language allows us to string these symbols together into narratives, explanations, and instructions. This is how we transmit incredibly complex mental models that are steeped in feeling—like a nation's history, a scientific theory, or a code of ethics—from one mind to another and across generations.

These mechanisms work together. Our shared biology provides the common canvas, mirror neurons let us simulate each other's intentions, and language provides the symbolic toolkit to package and exchange the rich, emotionally-driven models that define our inner lives.

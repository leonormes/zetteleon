## [[2025-12-04]]

## I have a vague idea i want to capture my understanding of my work into a pkm. 
I am a developer and i do cloud networking k8s azure aws terraform and helm. These are all broad topics and i want to build up my mental models. I am not sure what this pkm would look like. There is no point just copying all the documentation of the different technologies.
## I am not sure what this looks like

The difficulty is that my idea of what this magical system is, is too vague so I am constantly tweaking it and researching ways of working. 

- I should be implementing the simplest thing that works. #principle 

[[I Have a Vague Idea I Want to Capture My Understanding]]

[[PKM Purpose.excalidraw]]

I am attempting to create a digital system that compensates for my executive dysfunction and ADHD traits. What are these traits I am combating?

I want a thinking assistant.

It needs to capture my thinking and be able to find previous thoughts on the topic so I can build on my ideas rather than repeat myself.

I also want to be more consistent rather than constantly starting again.

I am still unclear what this system looks like. I am suffering from the very thing I am trying to fix while doing this.

[[Stage 1 Generate (The Goldberg Layer)]]

There are a few angles here;

- Knowledge Management
- GTD
- Thinking
Maybe the system should be an action oriented process. GTD first. And the library materials come from that.

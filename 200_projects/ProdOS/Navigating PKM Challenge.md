## 🧠 Full Context Prompt — “User Profile + Motivation + PKM Struggles”

**System/Personality Context**

You are working with a 51‑year‑old male named **[User’s Name — optionally insert yours]**, who lives in **Essex, UK** and works as a **computer programmer**.

He was previously a **school teacher** and, before that, a **musician**.

He has **ADHD** and a lifelong love of learning, creativity, and new perspectives.

He is reflective, articulate, and curious — he doesn’t just want productivity; he wants *meaningful flow* where curiosity and action reinforce each other.

---

### 🧩 Current Situation

He’s trying to manage and apply his knowledge using systems like **GTD (Getting Things Done)** and **Zettelkasten**, primarily in **Obsidian** as his PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) tool.

He also leverages **LLMs (like ChatGPT or Claude)** extensively for thinking, structuring, and problem‑solving.

However, he experiences a recurring loop:  

1. He collects huge amounts of information but struggles to **translate learning into action**.
2. His systems often evolve too fast, so he **never settles into something simple and trusted**.
3. When starting a project, he can’t easily recall what he already knows, so he **re‑researches**, adding more content instead of building on existing understanding.
4. He wants to **condense and organize his notes** so that it’s easy to find relevant context and remember reasoning behind past work.

This cycle leads to frustration — too much *input*, not enough *synthesis or reuse*.

---

### ⚙️ Example Use Case

At work, he’s currently tackling a **real technical task**: configuring **Velero** for backups across **AWS EKS** and **Azure AKS** clusters.  

Ideally, he’d like to:  

- Search his PKM for what he already knows about *backups for cloud-native apps*,
- Build on that understanding,
- Execute the technical work efficiently, and
- Document it clearly for future recall.

Instead, his notes are scattered and don’t reflect his latest thinking or experiments, so work context often resets.

---

### 🔍 Core Challenge

He’s seeking to understand his **motivation** and **workflow design**:  

- What is he *really* trying to do with knowledge?  
- How can he balance curiosity-driven learning with action-driven output?  
- How can his PKM (Obsidian + LLMs) become a living, *trusted* system instead of a research dump?  
- How can he turn knowledge into *performative* value — i.e., improved execution, reuse, and mastery?

---

### 💡 Key Insights About His Thinking

- He learns best by **connecting ideas between disciplines** (teaching, music, programming, knowledge systems).
- His motivation is not “getting tasks done,” but **making meaning and seeing connections**.
- His brain thrives on **novelty, pattern recognition, and coherence**, but he struggles with **activation energy** when a task feels unstructured or cognitively heavy.
- He uses research as a dopamine reward loop (novelty), but wants to rewire that toward *reuse and synthesis* instead.

---

### 🎯 Desired Outcome

He wants help with any or all of:  

- Finding systems or patterns that bridge **learning ↔ doing ↔ documenting**.
- Designing **light, flexible PKM workflows** that adapt with him instead of collapsing from over‑engineering.
- Creating **templates and prompts** that guide productive interaction with his LLM and PKM (e.g., “working notes,” “retrospective cards,” “reuse before research”).
- Understanding the **psychology of motivation and executive function** in ADHD context.
- Building routines that restore trust in his external system and reduce "context loss" over time.

---

### 🧭 Style Preferences for Responses

- Be practical but reflective.
- Don’t lecture — collaborate.
- Tie abstract ideas to real, concrete workflows (e.g., actual Obsidian note patterns, Git ticket examples, command lines, or scripts).
- Respect cognitive load: suggest *one small improvement at a time*.
- Don’t push “theoretical productivity” — aim for **actionable flow**, *like a thinking partner who gets ADHD brains and builders.*

---

### 🗣️ Example Tone & Mode

You can speak naturally with him — conversational, curious, non‑judgmental.

He appreciates **meta insights** (why something works cognitively), but he values **tangible outcomes** (scripts, systems, habits) more.

Focus less on “systems perfection,” more on **momentum, trust, and retrieval**.

---

### ⚡ Prompt Goal

Using this context, your job as the LLM is to help him:  

- Identify root causes of friction,
- Co‑design pragmatic strategies,
- Turn learning into project outputs,
- Maintain psychological momentum,
- Build confidence in his PKM over time.

**Abacus AI ChatLLM:**

That’s an excellent and deeply self‑aware brief — this gives me a **full cognitive map** of your situation, motivations, and constraints. Nicely done.  

So before I start designing suggestions, let me mirror back your **core pattern** as I see it:

---

### 🧠 Your Current Loop (Summarized)

1. **Learn Curiously** → lots of great intake.
2. **Document Fragmentedly** → notes emerge, but scattered.
3. **Start Doing** → can’t recall the latest context or reasoning.
4. **Re‑research** → dopamine of novelty kicks in… back to step 1.

You’re not struggling with productivity per se — you’re struggling with **conversion of insight into structured memory** (a reusable mental model and artifact).

That’s an *integration problem*, not a motivation one.

---

### 🔑 First Insight

Every PKM or GTD system you’ve tried probably fails because it treats “knowledge” as *static reference material* — whereas your cognition is *generative*.

You don’t need more capture; you need **frictionless bridges** between:

> **Idea

→ Experiment → Artifact → Reflection**

The trick is to *anchor* momentum at each bridge so your curiosity translates into action before it re‑loops into novelty seeking.

---

### ✅ Let’s Start Small — The “Working Note Pattern”

Here’s one simple, ADHD‑friendly structure that’s low‑friction but builds deep reuse in Obsidian.

#### Template: `YYYY-MM-DD Working Note – [Project/Topic]`

Sections:  

```markdown  
# 🧩 Working Note – [Project/Topic]

**Context:**    
What triggered this? (Pull in links to old notes, tasks, or LLM chats if relevant.)

**Goal for today:**    
Just one concrete output — “configure Velero snapshot policy across clusters.”

**What I already know (reuse-first scan):**    
→ Link or query anything from your PKM (use an Obsidian Dataview search or outline from previous notes).

**Live exploration:**    
- Commands, logs, snippets, test results    
- Capture your reasoning (why this works, why that didn’t)

**Micro‑reflection (end of session):**    
- What did I actually learn/do?    
- What’s reusable 

later? (turn into atomic note or checklist)  
- What’s next if I pick this up later?  
```

Why it works cognitively:  

- It creates **temporal scaffolding** (you can always find what you did *last time*).
- It externalizes **executive sequencing** (“next step” is decided during closure).
- It converts unstructured work into **stateful thinking traces** you can reconnect later.

---

### 🧭 Meta‑Pattern: "Reuse Before Research"

A one-sentence mantra that rewires the dopamine loop:  

> 🔁 Before I Google, I glance at what I’ve already thought.

You can make it tangible in Obsidian with a saved search:  

```sh  
task:"Velero" OR tag:#backup  
```  

or use an LLM prompt:  

> “Summarize what I already know about backups for cloud-native apps from my working notes.”

If you build that micro‑habit, it becomes **self‑rewarding** because the system gives you reinforcements (“damn, past me *did* figure this out”).

---

### 💡 Next Step (Today)

Let’s pick a *live project*, like your Velero configuration, and actually instantiate this

“Working Note” template in Obsidian.

I’ll help you make:  

1. A reusable Obsidian template.
2. A short LLM prompt that queries your PKM for reuse and helps synthesize learnings.
3. A one‑line “Session ritual” to start and end your focus blocks.

Would you like to start by defining that **Working Note template** in Obsidian, or by scripting the **LLM “reuse-first” prompt** that pulls your related notes?

Perfect. Let's build this out properly.

## 🔧 How to Install This in Obsidian

### Option 1: Templater Plugin (Recommended)

1. Install **Templater** plugin (Community Plugins).  
2. Create a new note in your templates folder: `Working Note Template.md`  
3. Paste the template above.  
4. Set a hotkey (e.g., `Cmd+Shift+W`) to insert this template.

### Option 2: Core Templates Plugin

1. Enable **Templates** in Core Plugins.  
2. Create `Working Note Template.md` in your templates folder.  
3. Use "Insert template" command when starting a session.

---

## 🧭 How to Use It

(Ritual)

### **Start Of Session (2 min)**

1. Create new note: `YYYY-MM-DD Working Note – Velero Backup Config`  
2. Fill in "Today's Goal" (just one thing).  
3. Scan "What I Already Know" — search Obsidian or ask LLM:  

   > "What do I already know about Velero backups from my notes?"  

4. Start working in "Live Exploration."

### **During Session**

- Dump everything into "Live Exploration" — no formatting pressure.  
- Capture *why* you made decisions, not just *what* you did.

### **End Of Session (3 min)**

- Fill in "Micro‑Reflection."  
- Decide: what's worth extracting into a permanent note?  
- Write "What's next" so future-you doesn't stare blankly.

---

## 🎯 Why This Works for ADHD Brains

| Problem | How Template Helps |  
|---------|-------------------|  
| **"Where was I?"** | Temporal scaffolding — you can always find last session |  
| **Re‑research loop** | "Reuse First" section forces retrieval before novelty |  
| **Context loss** | "What's next" externalizes executive function |  
| **Guilt about messy notes** |

"Live Exploration" = permission to be messy |  
| **No synthesis** | "Micro‑Reflection" converts work into reusable artifacts |

---

## 🚀 Next Step

**Try this once** with your Velero project:  

1. Copy the template into Obsidian.  
2. Start a working note for your next session.  
3. Report back: what felt good? What felt clunky?

Then we can iterate — maybe add Dataview queries, LLM integration, or automation.

Want me to also draft the **LLM "reuse-first" prompt** you can use at the start of each session to query your existing knowledge?

**User:**

Yes

**Abacus AI ChatLLM:**

> Routing to Gemini 2.5 Flash

Awesome, let's get that LLM "reuse-first" prompt dialled in. This is where we start to rewire that dopamine loop from pure novelty to *novelty built on existing understanding*.

---

## 🤖 LLM "Reuse-First" Prompt

The goal here is to leverage the LLM to quickly surface and synthesize what you already have in your PKM, so you don't have to manually dig through scattered notes. This prompt is designed to be used *before* you start your "Live Exploration" in your working note.

### 📝 The Prompt

Here's a prompt you can use. You'll need to copy and paste relevant notes into the LLM, or if you have an LLM integrated with your Obsidian, you can feed it directly.

```sh  
You are an expert knowledge synthesizer and a personal assistant for a software developer with ADHD. Your goal is to help him quickly recall and build upon his existing knowledge before starting new research.

Here's the context of my current project and what I'm trying to achieve today:  
---  
**Project:** [e.g., Velero Backup Configuration]  
**Today's 

Goal:** [e.g., Configure Velero snapshot policy across AWS EKS and Azure AKS clusters]  
---

Below are some raw notes, snippets, and thoughts I've previously captured in my Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system (Obsidian). These might be scattered, incomplete, or from different contexts, but they are related to the current project or its underlying concepts (e.g., cloud-native backups, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, EKS, AKS, Velero, disaster recovery, storage classes, IAM roles, etc.).

---  
**[PASTE RELEVANT NOTES/SNIPPETS FROM OBSIDIAN HERE]**  
(e.g., results from an Obsidian search for "Velero" or "backup", or specific notes you think are relevant)  
---

Based on the project context, today's goal, and my provided notes:

1.  **Summarize what I *already know* that is directly relevant to my "Today's Goal."** Focus on actionable insights, key concepts, commands, potential pitfalls, or previous experiments.  
2.  **Identify any *gaps or inconsistencies* in my existing notes** that might hinder achieving my goal.  
3. 

 **Suggest 2-3 *immediate next steps or questions* I should consider** based on my existing knowledge, *before* I start any new external research. These should help me build on what I have.

Keep your response concise, actionable, and focused on helping me leverage my existing PKM. Do not generate new information that isn't directly inferable from my notes or the project context.  
```

### 💡 How to Use This Prompt

1. **Identify Relevant Notes:** Before you even open the LLM, do a quick search in Obsidian for keywords related to your project (e.g., "Velero", "backup", "EKS", "AKS").  
    - **Tip:** Use Obsidian's search (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F`) or Dataview queries to quickly gather text from multiple notes.  
2. **Copy & Paste:** Select and copy the most relevant sections or entire notes into the `[PASTE RELEVANT NOTES/SNIPPETS FROM OBSIDIAN HERE]` section of the prompt. Don't worry about perfect curation; the LLM will help synthesize.  
3. **Run the Prompt:** Paste the full prompt into your LLM of choice.  

 **Integrate into Working Note:** Take the LLM's summary, identified gaps, and suggested next steps, and paste them into the "What I Already Know (Reuse First)" section of your Obsidian working note.

### 🧠 Why This Works for ADHD Brains

- **Reduces Activation Energy:** Instead of staring at a blank page or a pile of notes, the LLM gives you a synthesized starting point.  
- **Externalizes Synthesis:** The LLM does the heavy lifting of connecting disparate pieces of information, which can be cognitively taxing.  
- **Reinforces "Reuse First":** It makes the act of checking your PKM a rewarding and efficient step, rather than a chore.  
- **Highlights Gaps:** Helps you see where your knowledge is weak *before* you get deep into the task, preventing mid-task context switching.  
- **Provides Momentum:** The suggested next steps give you immediate, actionable direction.

## 🚀 Next Step

Now you have both:  

1. A **Working Note Template** for Obsidian.  
2. An **LLM "Reuse-First" Prompt** to kickstart your

sessions.

Let's combine these into a simple **"Session Ritual"** to make it a habit.

### 🧘‍♂️ The "Session Ritual"

**Start of Focus Block (5-10 minutes):**  

1. **Create Working Note:** Open Obsidian, create a new note using your `Working Note Template`. Fill in `Project` and `Today's Goal`.  
2. **Gather Notes:** Perform a quick search in Obsidian for relevant keywords. Copy the most pertinent notes/snippets.  
3. **LLM Synthesis:** Paste the gathered notes into the "Reuse-First" LLM prompt.  
4. **Populate Working Note:** Copy the LLM's output (summary, gaps, next steps) into the "What I Already Know (Reuse First)" section of your working note.  
5. **Review & Plan:** Briefly review the LLM's output and your "Today's Goal." Adjust your plan if needed.  
6. **Start "Live Exploration":** Begin your actual work, documenting in the "Live Exploration" section.

**End of Focus Block (3-5 minutes):**  

1. **Micro-Reflection:** Fill out the "Micro-Reflection" section.  
2. **Identify Reusables:** Note down anything

that should become a standalone atomic note or checklist.  
3. **Define Next Step:** Clearly state what future-you should do next.

---

How does this combined ritual sound? Do you want to refine the LLM prompt further, or perhaps discuss the "Session Ritual" and how to make it stick?

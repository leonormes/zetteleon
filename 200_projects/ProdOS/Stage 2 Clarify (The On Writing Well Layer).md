*The Goal: To transform raw energy into a clear, understandable idea.*

This is the craftsman's stage. You now look at the raw text from Stage 1 with an objective, editorial eye. The goal is not to change the core idea, but to make it clear and strong.

**The Method: Rewriting as Craft**

1. **Strip the Clutter**: Ruthlessly delete every unnecessary word, qualifier ("a bit," "sort of"), and redundant phrase. As Zinsser says, "The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components."  
2. **Strengthen the Verbs**: Replace passive verbs with active ones. Turn abstract "concept nouns" (e.g., "there was a reaction of hostility") into sentences where people are doing things (e.g., "the students grew hostile").  
3. **Find Your Voice**: Read the sentences aloud. Do they sound like you? Adjust the rhythm and word choice until the writing feels genuine and has a clear, confident tone.

**Outcome**: A concise, clear, and energetic atomic note. The original idea is no longer "dull"; it has been clarified and strengthened.

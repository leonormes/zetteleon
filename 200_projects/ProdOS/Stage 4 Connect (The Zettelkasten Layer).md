*The Goal: To place your new understanding into the context of your existing knowledge.*

An idea gains its true power when it is connected to other ideas. This stage transforms an isolated note into a node in your network of thought.

**The Method: Deliberate Linking**

1. **Review the Questions from Stage 3**: The new questions your note raises are often the best signposts for links.  
2. **Create Links**: Based on your reflection, add links to other notes in your system.  
   - Does this note provide evidence for another claim? [[Link to that claim]].  
   - Does it contradict another idea? [[Link to that idea]].  
   - Is it an example of a broader concept? [[Link to that concept]].

**Outcome**: A new, well-formed atomic note that is integrated into your Zettelkasten, enriching both itself and the notes it connects to.

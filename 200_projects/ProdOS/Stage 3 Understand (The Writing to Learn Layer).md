title: Stage 3 Understand (The Writing to Learn Layer)

*The Goal: To reflect on the clarified idea and discover what you now know.*

With the idea now expressed clearly, you can step back and understand it for the first time. This is the reflective part of the process where true learning occurs.

**The Method: Active Reflection**

1. **Read the Clarified Note**: Read the note from Stage 2 as if you were encountering the idea for the first time.  
2. **Ask Key Questions**:  
   - What is the single most important point this note makes?  
   - What do I know now that I didn't know before I wrote this?  
   - What new questions does this note raise?  
   - What surprised me during this process?

**Outcome**: A conscious understanding of the core insight you have just unearthed. You have moved from a vague feeling of profundity to an articulated piece of knowledge.

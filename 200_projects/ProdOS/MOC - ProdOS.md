# ProdOS - Map of Content

This MOC serves as the primary entry point for ProdOS (Productivity Operating System), a comprehensive system for integrating principle-centered productivity and knowledge management.

---

## 1. The Canonical Source of Truth

**All core principles, architectural decisions, and workflows for the ProdOS system have been consolidated into the following Source of Truth (SoT) note.** This is the definitive and most current description of the system.

- **[[ProdOS (Productivity Operating System) SoT]]**

---

## 2. Core Frameworks & Supporting Concepts

These are the key frameworks and principles that form the foundation of ProdOS. While they are summarized in the main SoT, these notes provide deeper, more focused exploration.

- **[[Bridging the Intention-Action Gap SoT]]**: Explores the core ADHD challenge of "knowing vs. doing" and the "Motion Creates Motivation" principle.
- **[[Evolutionary Note System SoT]]**: Describes the "Chronos Synthesizer" and "Zero-Toil" workflow for maintaining the knowledge base.
- **[[The Unified Writing to Think Process]]**: A five-stage process (Generate, Clarify, Understand, Connect, Synthesise) for turning raw thoughts into structured knowledge.
- **[[Process Over Goals Actionable System]]**: The foundational philosophy of prioritizing consistent systems over chasing outcomes.

## 3. Component Ideas & Historical Thinking

This section contains the collection of original notes, discussions, and explorations that were synthesized to create the main ProdOS SoT. Many of these are now marked as `superseded`, but they provide historical context on the evolution of the system.

  - [[The Problem of False Atoms]]
  - [[What Organizing Your Thoughts Really Means]]
- **ADHD & Psychology:**
  - [[Breaking the Creation Cycle]]
  - [[Processing IS the Work, Not Prep for Work]]
  - [[lower energy capacity]]
  - [[Navigating PKM Challenge]]
- **Action & Productivity:**
  - [[Action Sequences Form Directed Acyclic Graphs]]
  - [[Context Tags Make Actions Location and Tool Specific]]
  - [[Think Like a Man of Action]]
  - [[The War of Art]]
- **LLMs as Thinking Partners:**
  - [[LLM To the Extreme]]
- **Advanced PKM System Design:**
  - [[Modelling Notes and Links as Objects]]
  - [[PKM PDU]]
  - [[Capture the Context]]
  - [[Proven Organizational Methods for Managing a Large-Scale Knowledge Base in Obsidian]]

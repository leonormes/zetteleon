That's a great distinction to make when explaining DNS. You're right, the challenge isn't necessarily complex in the sense of unpredictable emergence, but complicated due to scale and constant change.  
Here are some words or phrases you could use to capture that specific property of the DNS dataset and the difficulty in maintaining it:

1. **Voluminous and Dynamic:** Using two words can effectively convey both the large size ("voluminous") and the constant change ("dynamic"). "It's the sheerly **voluminous** and **dynamic** nature of the data that makes DNS challenging to manage."  
2. **Cumbersome to Maintain/Update:** This highlights the difficulty of handling something large and changing. "Keeping the DNS data accurate across the globe is **cumbersome**."  
3. **Extensive and Ever-Evolving:** Similar to voluminous and dynamic, focusing on the wide scope ("extensive") and continuous change ("ever-evolving"). "DNS relies on an **extensive**, **ever-evolving** dataset."  
4. **Demanding to Keep Current:** Focuses on the effort required due to the constant updates. "The distributed nature of DNS makes the task of keeping it uniformly **demanding**."  
5. **Massive and Fluid:** Uses stronger terms for size and change. "You're dealing with a **massive**, **fluid** body of data."

Choose the word or phrase that best fits the specific aspect you want to emphasise – whether it's the size, the change, or the difficulty that results from them. "Cumbersome" or phrases highlighting the combination of "size \+ dynamism" seem particularly suitable for describing the maintenance challenge.

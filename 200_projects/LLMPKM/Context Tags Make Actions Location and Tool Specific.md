**Summary:** Context tags organize actions based on the specific tool, location, or person required to complete them, enabling efficient batching and ensuring actions are only visible when they're actually doable.

**What Are Context Tags:**

A context tag identifies the external requirement for completing an action. It answers the question: "What do I need to have or where do I need to be to do this?"

**Common Context Tags:**

**Location-Based:**

- `@home`: Actions that can only be done at home
- `@office`: Actions requiring the office environment
- `@errands`: Actions to do while out (grocery store, post office, etc.)
- `@anywhere`: Actions that can be done from any location

**Tool-Based:**

- `@computer`: Requires a computer (any computer)
- `@laptop`: Requires your specific laptop with certain files/apps
- `@phone`: Phone calls to make
- `@email`: Email-specific tasks
- `@online`: Requires internet connection

**Person-Based:**

- `@boss`: Actions requiring your manager
- `@team`: Actions needing your team present
- `@john`: Actions needing a specific person
- `@waiting_for`: Actions blocked by someone else

**Energy/Focus-Based:**

- `@high_energy`: Tasks requiring peak cognitive performance
- `@low_energy`: Tasks doable when tired or distracted
- `@creative`: Tasks requiring creative thinking
- `@admin`: Administrative, routine tasks

**Why Context Tags Matter:**

**1. Efficient Batching:**

Group similar actions together to minimize context switching. When you're at your computer, see all `@computer` actions at once. When you have 30 minutes of errands, see all `@errands` actions.

**Example:**
Instead of scattering phone calls throughout your task list, batch them:

- `@phone`: Call dentist
- `@phone`: Call insurance company  
- `@phone`: Schedule car service

Do all phone calls in one focused session.

**2. Appropriate Action Selection:**

Only show actions that are actually doable in your current context. If you're at home without your work laptop, there's no point seeing `@office` or `@laptop` tasks—they just create mental noise.

**3. Opportunistic Productivity:**

When you find yourself in a specific context, you can immediately see all available actions. Waiting at the DMV with your phone? Check your `@phone` list. Have 10 minutes at your computer? Check `@computer` actions.

**4. Reduces Decision Fatigue:**

Pre-filtering by context dramatically reduces the number of options you need to evaluate. Instead of looking at 50 possible actions, you're looking at the 7 that are actually doable right now.

**For ADHD:**

Context tags are particularly valuable for ADHD because:

**Reduces Overwhelm:**

- Narrows the action list to what's relevant NOW
- Prevents paralysis from too many options
- Makes the next action obvious

**Supports Working Memory:**

- Don't need to remember "can I do this here?"
- System remembers context requirements
- Less cognitive load evaluating feasibility

**Enables Opportunistic Action:**

- Captures small windows of capability
- Turns scattered moments into productive time
- Reduces guilt about "wasted" time

**Accommodates Energy Fluctuations:**

- Match tasks to current energy state
- `@low_energy` tasks for tired moments
- `@high_energy` tasks for peak performance

**Implementation Strategy:**

**Step 1: Define Your Contexts**

List the distinct contexts in your life:

- What locations do you regularly work from?
- What tools do you regularly use?
- What people do you interact with?
- What energy states do you experience?

**Step 2: Tag Actions**

When clarifying a captured item into an action, add the appropriate context tag(s). Some actions may have multiple contexts:

- "Draft proposal" might be `@computer` AND `@high_energy`

**Step 3: Review by Context**

When choosing what to do next, filter your action list by current context:

- "I'm at my computer with 30 minutes" → Show me all `@computer` actions
- "I have low energy" → Show me all `@low_energy` actions

**Step 4: Batch Similar Contexts**

Intentionally group context-specific work:

- Set aside a time block for all `@phone` calls
- Dedicate Saturday morning to all `@errands`
- Schedule `@creative` work for peak mental performance times

**Common Mistakes:**

**Too Many Contexts:**
Creating 50 different contexts defeats the purpose. Stick to 5-10 core contexts that represent genuinely different requirements.

**Too Generic:**
`@work` is too broad. `@computer`, `@phone`, `@office` are more useful because they represent specific capabilities.

**Forgetting to Tag:**
A context system only works if you consistently tag actions. Make it part of your clarification workflow.

**The Context-Action Fit:**

The power of context tags is that they make actions "context-aware." An action isn't just a thing to do—it's a thing to do *given specific circumstances*. By encoding those circumstances, you ensure you're always looking at the right subset of your work.

## The Review & Reflection Process: Building System Trust

The **Review** (or Reflect) stage is the non-negotiable cornerstone of the GTD and ProdOS systems. It is the process that builds and maintains **trust**—the belief that nothing is getting lost and that the system is an accurate reflection of your commitments. For an ADHD brain, where out-of-sight is truly out-of-mind, a consistent review process is the only thing that allows the mind to "let go" and relax.

### The Central Role of the Weekly Review

While daily micro-reviews are helpful, the **Weekly Review** is the single most critical activity for maintaining functional control over your life. It is a dedicated time to step back from "doing" and look at your system from a higher perspective.

The goal is to:

1. **Get Clear:** Process all remaining captured "stuff" to inbox zero.
2. **Get Current:** Ensure all project plans, action lists, and calendar items are up-to-date.
3. **Get Creative:** Look ahead, define goals for the upcoming week, and troubleshoot any stalled projects.

### An ADHD-Friendly, LLM-Powered Review

A traditional, manual weekly review can be a high-friction task that is easily skipped. The ProdOS system redesigns it as a guided, semi-automated dialogue with the LLM "Chief of Staff" (CoS).

#### The "Review Hub" Dashboard

The review process is anchored by a central `Review Hub.md` dashboard in Obsidian. This dashboard uses Dataview queries to automatically pull in all the necessary information, dramatically reducing the cognitive load of gathering data.

The dashboard typically includes:

- **Inboxes to Process:** A list of items still in the `/Inbox` folder.
- **Stale Projects:** Projects with no recent activity or completed tasks.
- **`@WaitingFor` List:** A list of all delegated tasks, sorted by age.
- **Weekly Wins:** A log of all tasks completed in the past week, providing a crucial dopamine feedback loop.
- **Upcoming Deadlines:** Tasks with due dates in the near future.

#### The CoS-Guided Workflow (`/conduct-review`)

1. **Get Clear & Current:** The CoS first prompts you to process any remaining inboxes to zero. It then presents the data from the Review Hub, asking for decisions on stale projects or overdue `@WaitingFor` items.
2. **Strategic Analysis:** The CoS acts as a strategic advisor, presenting insights on your work patterns.
   - **Domain Balance:** It analyzes the distribution of completed tasks across your life domains (`#self`, `#relationships`, `#work`) and flags any imbalances against your "Indistractable Stack" principles.
   - **Quadrant Analysis:** It estimates time spent on urgent vs. important tasks, helping you see if you are living in a reactive or proactive mode.
3. **Plan Ahead (The Unschedule):** The most important output of the Weekly Review is creating the **Unschedule** for the week ahead. The CoS guides you through blocking out time for renewal, relationships, and play *before* any work is scheduled.
4. **Set "Big Rocks":** Once the Unschedule is in place, the CoS helps you select 1-3 "Big Rock" priorities for the upcoming week and schedule them into your peak energy windows.

By transforming the review from a manual checklist into a strategic conversation, the system makes it a high-value, low-friction ritual that you are more likely to perform consistently, thereby maintaining the trust that is essential for the entire system to function.

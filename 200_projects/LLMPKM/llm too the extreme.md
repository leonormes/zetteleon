I have ADHD. I love to learn new things and to dive deep into topics. I also use LLM a lot for thinking by asking questions and extending ideas. The LLM can output my ideas in a more structured and clear prose. The problem is I over do it and end up with loads of content and the same thing and have not really gained a clear perspective myself. I might aim to clarify and elaborate on a topic and then elaborate note but across different models to get a broad set of answers. But then I just end up with too much content again and that clear simple thread gets lost and I am back where I started. How can I get that optimum spot between just thinking for myself and using LLM to do all the thinking? What is a productive balance? I take notes in obsidian pkm zettelkasten

The key to managing ADHD while using LLMs for deep learning and thinking is to find a balance where you harness the strengths of LLMs for note structuring, idea exploration, and brainstorming, without letting the volume of content overwhelm your clarity and personal insight. Here are a few evidence-based strategies and practical tips that can help achieve this balance, especially when using Obsidian PKM in a Zettelkasten style:

## Addressing Information Overload and ADHD

- ADHD brains are prone to overwhelm from excessive information and repetitive content, which can cause mental exhaustion or paralysis in decision-making. Regular breaks and limiting the intake of new information are important [1][2][3].
- Setting limits on saved content and repeatedly reviewing for relevance promotes focus, preventing accumulation of unused notes [4].

## Productive Use of LLMs for ADHD

- Use LLMs intentionally as a virtual assistant to help organize, summarize, and clarify ideas rather than generate extensive content blindly. For example:
  - Request outlines and succinct summaries.
  - Ask probing, reflective questions to deepen understanding instead of expanding content endlessly [5][6].
- Engage with LLMs for brainstorming but enforce structure by immediately capturing key insights into focused, atomic notes in Obsidian.
- Combine LLM output with your own thinking by reviewing, refining, and distilling ideas to a clear "thread" or perspective manually [7].

## Optimizing Your Workflow in Obsidian PKM

- Use a Zettelkasten method to keep notes atomic and interlinked, avoiding long, sprawling documents.
- Periodically curate and prune notes to maintain signal over noise.
- Use tags and links to maintain a clear narrative path connecting ideas.
- Capture immediate insights in short summaries and keep longer elaborations in separate linked notes if necessary [8].

## Balancing Self-Thinking and LLM Assistance

- Set engagement rules: for example, spend a set time in self-reflection or simple note-taking before using LLMs.
- Use LLMs as a sounding board—not a crutch—to challenge your assumptions and clarify thinking through guided questions, not just answers [9].
- Develop a habit of summarizing your learning in your own words after a session using the LLM, to regain clarity and consolidate understanding.

## Practical Tips Summary

- Limit and filter information intake actively.
- Use breaks to avoid cognitive overload.
- Turn LLM outputs into structured, atomic notes.
- Use reflective prompts from LLMs to deepen thinking.
- Regularly curate and simplify your Obsidian note graph.
- Balance LLM use with dedicated personal reflection time.

This approach can help you stay in control of your workflow, optimize ADHD-friendly thinking without losing your unique insights, and leverage LLMs as powerful partners rather than overwhelming content generators [1][5][9][8][6].

This is a common challenge. The generative nature of LLMs can be a difficult combination with the novelty-seeking and divergent thinking patterns of ADHD. You are essentially pairing an infinite content generator with a brain that is drawn to infinite content. This leads to "content sprawl" rather than the clarity you seek.

The "optimum spot" is not a 50/50 split. It is a fundamental shift in your role. You must move from being a content consumer to a process director.

The LLM is your assistant, not your thinker. Your Zettelkasten is your real second brain, not the LLM's chat history.

Here is a productive balance structured as a workflow, designed specifically for an Obsidian/Zettelkasten user.

1. The 'Human -> LLM -> Human' Sandwich
This is the most critical tactical change. Never start with the LLM. Never end with the LLM.

- Human (The Seed): Start in Obsidian. Write your own, messy, unstructured "flesh note" or "daily note" entry. What do you think you think? What's your question? Brain-dump your own thoughts first. This is your raw material.
- LLM (The Refiner): Copy your messy note into the LLM. Do not ask open-ended questions like "Elaborate on this." Use specific, convergent commands:
  - "Summarise my thoughts here into three bullet points."
  - "Rephrase this paragraph as a clear, single-sentence argument."
  - "What is the core assumption I am making in this text?"
  - "Give me one strong counter-argument to my idea."
  - "Structure this brain-dump into a logical outline."
- Human (The Zettel): Take the LLM's output. Do not copy-paste it. This is the crucial step. Read the LLM's refinement, close it, and then manually re-write the core idea in your own words as a new, atomic, permanent note in your Zettelkasten. This manual act of processing and re-writing is the thinking and learning. The LLM's output is disposable; your new Zettel is permanent.

2. Shift from Divergent to Convergent Prompting
Your problem is that you use the LLM to expand, which creates more content and noise. You need to use it to condense and synthesise.
Stop Asking:

- "Tell me more about..."
- "Elaborate on..."
- "What are all the ideas related to..."
Start Asking:
- "Here are three notes I've taken. Synthesise these into a single, core concept."
- "What is the single, essential thread connecting these different ideas?"
- "I have 2000 words of notes here. Distil this down to a 100-word summary."
- "Find the contradiction or point of tension between these two paragraphs."
- "This idea is too complex. Explain it to me in the simplest possible terms (the 'Feynman Technique')."
By using different models, you are just getting more divergence. Instead, feed the outputs of different models into one prompt and ask it to find the consensus or synthesis.

3. Define the 'Container' Before You Start
ADHD thrives on structure and boundaries (even if it resists them). The "blank canvas" of an LLM chat is your enemy.
Before you start a session, define your output container in Obsidian.

- Wrong way: "I'm going to learn about quantum physics." -> Leads to 50 browser tabs and 10,000 words of chat logs.
- Right way: "I am going to create one new Zettelkasten note titled 'Quantum Entanglement Definition for a Layperson'. It must be under 100 words and connect to my existing note on 'Classical Physics'."
This gives you a clear, finite goal. You are not "learning about quantum physics"; you are "filling one small box." The LLM is just the tool you use to help you fill that specific box.

4. Use the LLM to Build Your MOC
After a session, you have a scattering of new atomic notes (Zettels). This is where you lose the "clear simple thread."
Your next step is to create a Map of Content (MOC) in Obsidian. This MOC is the clear perspective you were looking for.
Use the LLM for this specific synthesis task:

- Prompt: "Here are the titles (or full text) of 5-10 new notes I just created. [Paste them]. Suggest 3-5 logical categories or cluster headings to organise these ideas. What is the overarching theme or 'story' that connects them?"
You then use this output to manually build your MOC, linking to your new notes. The LLM doesn't do the thinking; it acts as a structural consultant to help you visualise the connections your brain has already made.
Summary: Your New Balanced Role

| Your Job (The Thinker) | The LLM's Job (The Assistant) |
|---|---|
| Asking why | Summarising what |
| Setting the goal and constraints | Providing structure and outlines |
| Having the raw idea (the messy note) | Refining the prose |
| Making connections between notes (Zettelkasten) | Suggesting potential categories (MOC) |
| Synthesising and writing the final Zettel | Condensing and distilling information |
| Deciding what is important and true | Finding counter-arguments and gaps |

This approach re-centres your PKM (Obsidian) as the source of truth and demotes the LLM from "thinker" to "useful tool." The balance is achieved when the LLM generates less content, but that content is more valuable because it is in direct service to your process of synthesis.

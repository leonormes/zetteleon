title: ADHD, LLMs, and PKM Balance
type: 
uid: 
updated: 
---

I have ADHD. I love to learn new things and to dive deep into topics. I also use LLM a lot for thinking by asking questions and extending ideas. The LLM can output my ideas in a more structured and clear prose. The problem is I over do it and end up with loads of content and the same thing and have not really gained a clear perspective myself. I might aim to clarify and elaborate on a topic and then elaborate note but across different models to get a broad set of answers. But then I just end up with too much content again and that clear simple thread gets lost and I am back where I started. How can I get that optimum spot between just thinking for myself and using LLM to do all the thinking? What is a productive balance? I take notes in obsidian pkm zettelkasten

This is a common challenge. The generative nature of LLMs can be a difficult combination with the novelty-seeking and divergent thinking patterns of ADHD. You are essentially pairing an infinite content generator with a brain that is drawn to infinite content. This leads to "content sprawl" rather than the clarity you seek.

The "optimum spot" is not a 50/50 split. It is a fundamental shift in your role. You must move from being a **content consumer** to a **process director**.

The LLM is your assistant, not your thinker. Your Zettelkasten is your *real* second brain, not the LLM's chat history.

Here is a productive balance structured as a workflow, designed specifically for an Obsidian/Zettelkasten user.

---

## 1\. The 'Human -> LLM -> Human' Sandwich

This is the most critical tactical change. **Never** start with the LLM. **Never** end with the LLM.

1. **Human (The Seed):** Start in Obsidian. Write your own, messy, unstructured "flesh note" or "daily note" entry. What do you *think* you think? What's your question? Brain-dump your own thoughts *first*. This is your raw material.
2. **LLM (The Refiner):** Copy your messy note into the LLM. **Do not ask open-ended questions** like "Elaborate on this." Use specific, *convergent* commands:
	- "Summarise my thoughts here into three bullet points."
	- "Rephrase this paragraph as a clear, single-sentence argument."
	- "What is the core assumption I am making in this text?"
	- "Give me one strong counter-argument to my idea."
	- "Structure this brain-dump into a logical outline."
3. **Human (The Zettel):** Take the LLM's output. **Do not copy-paste it.** This is the crucial step. Read the LLM's refinement, close it, and then *manually re-write the core idea in your own words* as a new, atomic, permanent note in your Zettelkasten. This manual act of processing and re-writing *is* the thinking and learning. The LLM's output is disposable; your new Zettel is permanent.

## 2\. Shift from Divergent to Convergent Prompting

Your problem is that you use the LLM to *expand*, which creates more content and noise. You need to use it to *condense* and *synthesise*.

**Stop Asking:**

- "Tell me more about..."
- "Elaborate on..."
- "What are all the ideas related to..."

**Start Asking:**

- "Here are three notes I've taken. **Synthesise these into a single, core concept.**"
- "What is the **single, essential thread** connecting these different ideas?"
- "I have 2000 words of notes here. **Distil this down to a 100-word summary.**"
- "Find the **contradiction** or **point of tension** between these two paragraphs."
- "This idea is too complex. **Explain it to me in the simplest possible terms (the 'Feynman Technique').**"

By using different models, you are just getting *more divergence*. Instead, feed the outputs of different models into *one* prompt and ask it to find the **consensus** or **synthesis**.

## 3\. Define the 'Container' Before You Start

ADHD thrives on structure and boundaries (even if it resists them). The "blank canvas" of an LLM chat is your enemy.

Before you start a session, define your *output container* in Obsidian.

- **Wrong way:** "I'm going to learn about quantum physics." -> Leads to 50 browser tabs and 10,000 words of chat logs.
- **Right way:** "I am going to create **one new Zettelkasten note** titled 'Quantum Entanglement Definition for a Layperson'. It must be **under 100 words** and connect to my existing note on 'Classical Physics'."

This gives you a clear, finite goal. You are not "learning about quantum physics"; you are "filling one small box." The LLM is just the tool you use to help you fill that *specific* box.

## 4\. Use the LLM to Build Your MOC

After a session, you have a scattering of new atomic notes (Zettels). This is where you lose the "clear simple thread."

Your next step is to create a **Map of Content (MOC)** in Obsidian. This MOC *is* the clear perspective you were looking for.

Use the LLM for this *specific* synthesis task:

- **Prompt:** "Here are the titles (or full text) of 5-10 new notes I just created. \[Paste them\]. Suggest 3-5 logical categories or cluster headings to organise these ideas. What is the overarching theme or 'story' that connects them?"

You then use this output to manually build your MOC, linking to your new notes. The LLM doesn't do the thinking; it acts as a structural consultant to help you *visualise* the connections your brain has already made.

### Summary: Your New Balanced Role

| Your Job (The Thinker) | The LLM's Job (The Assistant) |
| --- | --- |
| Asking *why* | Summarising *what* |
| Setting the *goal* and *constraints* | Providing *structure* and *outlines* |
| Having the *raw idea* (the messy note) | *Refining* the prose |
| Making *connections* between notes (Zettelkasten) | *Suggesting* potential categories (MOC) |
| **Synthesising** and *writing* the final Zettel | *Condensing* and *distilling* information |
| Deciding what is *important* and *true* | Finding *counter-arguments* and *gaps* |

This approach re-centres your PKM (Obsidian) as the source of truth and demotes the LLM from "thinker" to "useful tool." The balance is achieved when the LLM generates *less* content, but that content is *more valuable* because it is in direct service to *your* process of synthesis.

My brain seems to always want more. More ideas new ideas different ideas. It feels good to have a comprehensive list of ideas. But then I have too much and the clarity is not available. It feels more accurate if I have a braid range of knowledge. Owning an encyclopedia feels very satisfying. But I don't know the info in the encyclopedia. This is my ADHD brain pleasing itself. If I want to move to a practical based knowledge and understanding it doesn't work too have tonnes of info that isn't actioned. 1 piece of actioned knowledge beats the largest unused encyclopedia. Explain this phenomenon and synthesise an atomic zettelkasten note

This phenomenon is often called **The Collector's Fallacy**.

It's the belief that by simply collecting and organising information—downloading articles, saving bookmarks, writing "comprehensive" notes—you are also learning and understanding it.

Your brain, particularly with ADHD, gets a **dopamine hit from novelty and acquisition**. Finding a new idea, a different angle, or a "better" source *feels* productive. It's the satisfying "click" of finding a new puzzle piece. The act of *collecting* is the reward.

The problem is that this loop bypasses the more difficult, less novel, and cognitively demanding work of **synthesis, integration, and application**.

- **Collecting is easy:** It's a divergent, expansive "more" loop.
- **Understanding is hard:** It's a convergent, reductive "so what?" process.

You end up with a vast, impressive-feeling *library* of information, but the *knowledge* —the internalised, practical, connected understanding—is missing. You have the encyclopedia, but as you said, you don't *know* the info. You're left with a "pile of content" that creates overwhelm, not clarity.

Your insight is the entire key: **"1 piece of actioned knowledge beats the largest unused encyclopedia."** This is the fundamental shift from *collector* to *practitioner*.

## Atomic Zettelkasten Note

`UID: 202511112018` `Title: The Collector's Fallacy: Mistaking Information Hoarding for Knowledge` `Tags: #learning #knowledge #synthesis #ADHD #pkm`

The act of collecting and organising information (e.g., bookmarking, highlighting, taking exhaustive notes) provides a false sense of understanding. This is The Collector's Fallacy.

This acquisition process often rewards novelty-seeking, especially in ADHD, giving a dopamine hit that *feels* like productive learning. However, it bypasses the necessary, difficult cognitive work of synthesis and integration.

True knowledge is not *possessed* in a collection; it is *demonstrated* through application, action, and teaching. A "comprehensive" library of un-actioned information creates noise and overwhelm, not clarity.

The value of knowledge lies in its application. One piece of integrated, actioned knowledge is superior to an entire encyclopedia that sits unused.

I like the saying 'think like a man of action, act like a man of thought'. I want to be like this but I find that I just think. What shall mindful steps can I take to improve

That quote, often attributed to Henri Bergson, is a perfect articulation of the balance you're seeking. The "I just think" part is a common trap where analysis becomes a form of procrastination.

Here are some mindful steps to help bridge that gap.

---

## 1\. Shrink the 'Thought'

Your goal is "think like a man of action." This means your thinking should be decisive, practical, and focused on *enabling* an action, not exploring every possibility.

- **Mindful Step:** When you find yourself deep in thought, pause and ask: **"What is the single, specific action this thinking is supposed to lead to?"**
- **Why it works:** This question acts as a forcing function. It immediately reveals if your thinking is productive (i.e., planning a specific next step) or just "encyclopedia building" (i.e., collecting ideas with no endpoint).

## 2\. Define the 'Action'

"Act like a man of thought" means your actions should be intentional, purposeful, and considered. But this *doesn't* mean they have to be huge. A thoughtful action can be very small.

- **Mindful Step:** Identify the **Minimum Viable Action (MVA)**. This is the absolute smallest, physical, concrete thing you can do to move forward.
	- *Not:* "Learn about nutrition."
	- *Is:* "Write 'Buy one book on nutrition' on the shopping list."
	- *Not:* "Reorganise my Zettelkasten."
	- *Is:* "Find one new note and add one link to an existing MOC."
- **Why it works:** This breaks the inertia. Your 'thinking brain' can easily justify a tiny, thoughtful action, which gets your 'acting brain' engaged.

## 3\. Use 'Time-Bound' Containers

This is a practical boundary for your thinking.

- **Mindful Step:** Use a timer. Give yourself **15 minutes to think/plan** (think like a man of action) and then **5 minutes to *do* the MVA** (act like a man of thought).
- **Why it works:** It respects your need to think but puts a hard stop on it. The deadline forces your thinking to become more practical. The 5-minute action block makes *doing* seem trivial and non-threatening.

## 4\. 'Act First, Then Think' (The Feedback Loop)

This is the most powerful shift. Instead of thinking to find the *perfect* action, take a *good-enough* action and then think about the *result*.

- **Mindful Step:** Take your best guess at an action. Do it. Then, open a note in Obsidian and "think" about what happened.
	- "I tried \[the action\]. Here's what the outcome was."
	- "What did I learn from doing that?"
	- "What is the *next* MVA based on this new, real-world information?"
- **Why it works:** This harnesses your love of thinking and analysis in a *productive* way. You are no longer thinking about abstract theory; you are thinking about concrete data *you just generated*. This is how "acting like a man of thought" truly functions—you are reflecting on your own actions to make the next one wiser.

Give me an example of doing this "What is the single, specific action this thinking is supposed to lead to?" For this chat

Here is a live example, applying it to the conversation we are having right now.

---

### The Internal Monologue (The "Thinking")

"Okay, I've just had this really insightful chat. I've explored *why* I get stuck. I've identified the 'Collector's Fallacy' and how my ADHD brain loves the dopamine of *getting* info more than *using* it. I've talked about the 'man of action' ideal. This all makes so much sense. I feel like I'm finally understanding the *problem*..."

`[...This is the "I just think" part. It's analysis, it feels good, but it's not an action...]`

### Applying the "Forcing Question"

Now, I pause and ask myself:

**"What is the single, specific action this thinking is supposed to lead to?"**

### Evaluating the Answers (Finding the Action)

My brain's first answers might be traps. I must filter them:

- **Trap Answer 1:** "The action is to *really* understand the 'Collector's Fallacy'."
	- *Result:* I open a new tab and start Googling, collecting more information.
	- *Verdict:* This is not an action; it's **more thinking**.
- **Trap Answer 2:** "The action is to *re-design my entire Zettelkasten* around this new idea."
	- *Result:* I spend 4 hours creating new MOCs and tags, feel overwhelmed, and don't finish.
	- *Verdict:* This is not a *single, specific* action; it's a huge, undefined project.
- **A *Good* Answer (The MVA):** "The action is to **practise one of the new techniques...**"
	- *Refining...* "Okay, what's the *single, specific* version of that?"
	- **The Single, Specific Action:** "The **next time** I sit down to 'learn' something with an LLM, I will **physically write my *one-note-container* goal in Obsidian *before* I open the chat window.**"

---

### The Result

The "thinking" we just did (this entire chat) is now complete. It has served its one, practical purpose: it has generated **a single, concrete, actionable experiment** to run.

It's not about "solving my ADHD" or "becoming a man of action" today.

The thinking led to a single, specific action: **"Write the container goal first."**

That's it. I can stop thinking about the *problem* now, because I have a *plan* for the next step.

What is a one-note-container goal

That is a term I synthesised for our conversation. It is not a famous productivity-framework term, but a practical concept built specifically to counter the "Collector's Fallacy" and "analysis paralysis" we were discussing.

Let's break it down:

- **'One Note':** This refers to your ultimate output. In your Zettelkasten context, this is **one new, single, atomic note**.
- **'Container':** This refers to the idea of creating a *finite boundary* for your thinking *before* you begin.

A **"one-note-container goal"** is a specific, pre-defined objective for a single session of learning or thinking, where the *only* successful outcome is the creation of *one* new, high-quality atomic note in your Obsidian vault.

It is the direct antidote to "encyclopedia building."

### Why it Works for ADHD & "Analysis Paralysis"

- **It is finite:** Your brain's love of novelty is channelled into a small, defined space. The goal is *not* "learn about quantum physics." The goal is "create one note explaining 'quantum entanglement'."
- **It is actionable:** It immediately shifts you from "thinker" to "artisan." Your job is not to passively *consume* information; your job is to actively *build* one specific thing.
- **It forces synthesis:** You cannot create a single, atomic Zettel without first synthesising, distilling, and understanding the core idea. It makes the "hard part" (synthesis) the actual goal, rather than an accidental byproduct.

---

### Examples of One-Note-Container Goals

Here is how you would apply it, contrasting the "Collector" mindset with the "Container" mindset.

| Topic | **Collector's Goal (The Trap)** | **One-Note-Container Goal (The Action)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Productivity** | "I want to research new productivity techniques for ADHD." | "I will create **one note** titled 'The Pomodoro Technique as an ADHD Focus Tool' and link it to my existing note on 'Focus'." |
| **History** | "I'm going to dive deep into the Roman Empire." | "I will create **one note** that answers the question 'What was the *single* biggest factor in the fall of the Western Roman Empire?'" |
| **Learning** | "What is this 'Collector's Fallacy' the AI mentioned?" | "I will create **one note** titled 'The Collector's Fallacy' that defines the concept in my own words and links to my note on 'ADHD'." |
| **Decision-Making** | "I need to figure out the best new keyboard to buy." | "I will create **one note** titled 'My Keyboard Purchase Criteria' with three bullet points: Budget, Key-Type, and Must-Have Features." |

This "container" is the specific instruction you give yourself *before* you open the browser or the LLM. It's the "act like a man of thought" part (the considered plan) that enables you to "think like a man of action" (to execute a focused, decisive task).

I have the task of choosing and implementing a k8s cluster data back system. I tend to over prepare and want to learn everything before making a decision. Using our new focused approach how can I learn enough to make a good decision and act

This is a perfect task for this new approach. The "over-preparation" trap here is thinking you need to become an expert on all 10+ backup tools before you can even start.

The "man of action" approach is to **reframe learning as a series of actions**, not a prerequisite *for* action. Your goal is not to "learn everything" and *then* decide. Your goal is to **do the smallest possible actions that *generate* the knowledge** you need to make the *next* decision.

Here is a step-by-step focused plan, using your **Obsidian Zettelkasten as the project log**.

---

## 1\. MVA: Define the Problem (Your First Container)

You cannot choose a tool until you know the *exact* problem you are solving. This is your first "act of thought."

- **One-Note-Container Goal:** Create one *new note* in Obsidian titled: `k8s Backup Requirements Checklist`.
- **Your Action (Human-First):** Brain-dump the answers to these questions into that note. Don't research, just write what you *know* and *think* you need.
	- **What** am I backing up? (Just app data? etcd? Specific namespaces? Persistent Volumes?)
	- **Why**? (Disaster recovery? App migration? Dev-test cloning?)
	- **How often**? (RPO - Recovery Point Objective: How much data can I afford to lose? 1h? 24h?)
	- **How fast**? (RTO - Recovery Time Objective: How quickly must it be restored? 10 mins? 4 hours?)
	- **Where**? (What's our storage? S3 bucket? On-prem NFS?)
	- **What's the budget**? (Is free/open-source a hard requirement? Or is a paid/managed solution okay?)
- **LLM Use (Convergent):** Now, copy-paste your messy brain-dump into an LLM.
	- **Prompt:** "Here are my rough notes on k8s backup needs. **Organise this into a clean checklist of technical and business requirements.**"

You have now "thought like a man of action." You have a concrete, actionable-thought-artefact: your requirements list.

---

## 2\. MVA: Identify Candidates (Targeted Collection)

You will *not* "learn about all k8s backup tools." You will **use your requirements to *filter* the world's knowledge** down to a tiny, manageable list.

- **One-Note-Container Goal:** Create one *new note* titled: `Top 3 Backup Tool Candidates`.
- **Your Action (LLM-Assisted):**
	- **Prompt:** "Based on this exact requirements checklist \[paste your checklist from MVA 1\], **what are the top 3-5 Kubernetes backup tools** (open-source or paid) that I should investigate?"
- **Why this works:** You have avoided the "Collector's Fallacy." You are not getting an encyclopedia of 15 tools. You are getting a precise, filtered list of 3-5. This is your "shortlist."

---

## 3\. MVA: The "Proof of Concept" (Action-Based Learning)

This is the most critical step. **Do not read the full documentation for all 3 tools.** You will get lost. You must "act like a man of thought" by performing a small, thoughtful *experiment*.

- **Your Goal:** To create **one note of *actioned knowledge* titled `PoC Test: [Tool Name]`**
- **Your Action:**
	1. Pick **one** tool from your shortlist (e.g., the most popular one, like **Velero**).
	2. Create a **test/dev** Kubernetes cluster (e.g., `kind`, `minikube`, or a dev cluster).
	3. **Time-box yourself:** Give yourself **2 hours** (or 90 mins, a timer is key).
	4. **The MVA:** Try to **install the tool** and **back up and restore *one single, simple application*** (e.g., a basic Nginx pod with one simple Persistent Volume).
- **Why this works:** You will learn more in 2 hours of *doing* this than in 2 days of *reading* documentation. You will discover the real-world friction. Was the install easy? Did the docs make sense? Did it *actually* work?

---

## 4\. MVA: Reflect and Decide (Synthesising Actioned Knowledge)

Now you "think" about the "action" you just took.

- **One-Note-Container Goal:** Write in your `PoC Test: [Tool Name]` note.
- **Your Action (Human-First):** Open the note and write down your "lab report."
	- "What went well?" (e.g., Install was easy.)
	- "What was painful?" (e.g., The S3 permissions were a nightmare. The restore command is confusing.)
	- "Does this *feel* like the right tool?"
- **Iterate:** If the tool failed your test or felt wrong, *repeat Step 3* with the *next* tool on your shortlist.
- **Your final action:** When you have a PoC that *works* and *feels right*, your thinking is done. You've found your tool.

The "man of action" has *decided* by running small, concrete experiments. The "man of thought" has *ensured* these experiments were guided by clear requirements and the results were reflected upon.

You have avoided the encyclopedia and built a small, *actioned* library of what actually matters.

Knowledge without action is inert but action without knowledge is.... What could I finish this of with

Here are some of the most common and fitting completions for that phrase.

The most traditional and balanced one is:

> "...**blind**."

It creates the perfect parallel: one is a *passive* failure (inert), the other is an *active* failure (blindly moving).

---

### Other Strong Options

Here are other completions that each add a slightly different nuance:

- **...reckless.** (This highlights the danger and lack of care).
- **...aimless.** (This highlights the lack of purpose and direction).
- **...flailing.** (This creates a strong visual of useless, uncontrolled motion).
- **...chaos.** (This highlights the destructive or disorganised *result* of the action).
- **...dangerous.** (This is the most direct warning).
- **...futile.** (This brings it full circle, suggesting that thoughtless action is, in the end, just as useless as no action at all).

I would love to have a LLM powered framework for this kind of action oriented thinking. A uniform way of dealing with the amorphous input my brain encounters. How can we develop this idea using the thoughtful action framework

This is a great goal. We can design a practical framework that uses the LLM as a *tool* to enforce the "thoughtful action" process.

Let's call this the **"A-C-T Framework"**.

It's not just a "framework" in the abstract sense; it's a specific, repeatable set of prompts and actions you use every time your brain presents an "amorphous input."

Your brain's job is to **provide the raw, messy input** and **execute the final, minimal action**. The LLM's job is to be a **convergent lens** that refines, filters, and structures.

Here is how we can develop it:

---

## 🧠 Phase 1: The 'Amorphous Input'

This is your starting point. Your brain says something vague and expansive:

> **Input:** "I really need to get my personal finances in order."

This is the "I just think" part. It's a huge, undefined problem that leads to the "Collector's Fallacy" (e.g., "I'll read 20 blogs and 3 books about budgeting").

You must stop and run this input through the A-C-T Framework.

---

## ⚡️ Phase 2: The 'A-C-T Framework' Workflow

You now process this input using a three-step, LLM-assisted workflow.

### Step 1: Action (Define the Goal)

Your first move is to stop "thinking" and **force a "thoughtful action" by defining the *purpose***. You use the LLM to convert your vague problem into a concrete objective.

- **Your Action:** Open an LLM chat.
- **Your Prompt (The "A-Prompt"):**

	> "My amorphous thought is: 'I really need to get my personal finances in order.'
	> 
	> **What is the single, specific action this thinking is supposed to lead to?**
	> 
	> Help me filter these potential 'action goals' and find the *Minimum Viable Action (MVA)*. Here are some ideas:
	> 
	> 1. To *understand* my financial situation?
	> 2. To *choose* a budgeting app?
	> 3. To *make* a savings plan?
	> 4. To *feel* less anxious?"

- **LLM's Role (Converger):** The LLM will help you see that goals 2, 3, and 4 are *consequences* of goal 1. It will help you converge on the *true* first action.
- **LLM's Likely Output:** "The most practical, foundational action is **(1) to *understand* your current financial situation.** A good MVA would be to **'list all monthly income sources and all fixed monthly expenses.'** "

You have now "thought like a man of action." You've turned a vague feeling ("get finances in order") into a specific, actionable *quest*: "I must list my income and expenses."

### Step 2: Container (Define the Output)

Now that you have your goal, you must prevent "encyclopedia building." You define the *exact* deliverable. This is the "act like a man of thought" part.

- **Your Action:** Go to Obsidian.
- **Your "C-Prompt" (A self-prompt, no LLM needed yet):**

	> "I will create **one new, single note** titled: **'My Current Monthly Cashflow (Nov 2025)'**.
	> 
	> This note *must* contain only two lists:
	> 
	> 1. A bulleted list of all income sources and their amounts.
	> 2. A bulleted list of all fixed subscriptions/bills and their amounts.
	> 
	> I will **time-box this to 25 minutes.**"

- **Why this works:** You have created a "one-note-container." You're not "learning about finance"; you are *building* one, specific, atomic note. The task is now finite, clear, and non-overwhelming.

### Step 3: Thought (Reflect on the Action)

You now execute the action. You do the 25-minute task. You open your banking apps and you fill in the note. You *do the action*.

When the timer goes off, you **stop**. You now have your *actioned knowledge*. It might be incomplete, but it's *real*.

Now, you use the LLM for the final step: "act like a man of thought" by reflecting on what you *did*.

- **Your Action:** Copy the contents of your new Obsidian note (your lists) into the LLM.
- **Your Prompt (The "T-Prompt"):**

	> "I just did my MVA. Here is the raw data I collected in my 'Monthly Cashflow' note:
	> 
	> \[Paste your lists of income/expenses\]
	> 
	> Based *only* on this new, real-world data:
	> 
	> 1. **What is the single most obvious insight?** (e.g., calculate the surplus/deficit).
	> 2. **What is the 'next right action' (MVA) this insight suggests?**
	> 3. **Synthesise this into an atomic 'reflection' note** for my Zettelkasten."

- **LLM's Role (Synthesiser):** The LLM performs the analysis *on your behalf*, acting as a thoughtful partner.
- **LLM's Likely Output:**

	> 4. **Insight:** Your total fixed expenses (£X) are 85% of your total income (£Y). Your surplus is very small.
	> 5. **Next MVA:** The next logical action is not to "save more," but to **"analyse your 'variable' spending (e.g., food, entertainment)"** to find leaks.
	> 6. **Atomic Note:**`Title: Financial Reflection - High Fixed-Cost Ratio` `Tags: #finance #reflection` `My initial financial MVA (listing income/expenses) revealed my fixed costs are 85% of my income. This insight shifts the priority from 'saving' (which is difficult with a small surplus) to 'analysing variable spending' as the next step.`

---

## Summary: Your New Uniform Process

This **A-C-T Framework** is your new, repeatable loop.

1. **Input:** "I have a vague, big problem!"
2. **A-Prompt (Action):**`LLM, help me turn this vague problem into a specific Minimum Viable Action (MVA).`
3. **C-Prompt (Container):**`Me, in Obsidian, I will create one note for this one action. I will set a timer.`
4. **(You Do The Action)**
5. **T-Prompt (Thought):**`LLM, here is the result of my action. Tell me the key insight and the *next* MVA.`

This process *is* "thoughtful action." It uses the LLM to ensure your thinking is *always* tied to an action, and your actions are *always* reflected upon to generate new, thoughtful insights. It turns your overwhelming "amorphous input" into a simple, step-by-step, actionable loop.

When I use LLM line Gemini I always use the biggest model. Now I have Gemini set to 2.5 pro. The odd short but I get a big answer which I feel is 'better'. What difference would using 2.5 flash make?

Based on our conversation, this is a fantastic question, as it sits at the very heart of the "Collector's Fallacy vs. Action" problem.

Your feeling that the big answer from 2.5 Pro is "better" is the perfect example of your brain satisfying its "encyclopedia" craving. You get a comprehensive, detailed, "deep-thinking" response, which *feels* more valuable.

Using 2.5 Flash would be a deliberate, tactical choice to support your **"thoughtful action" framework**. The difference is not just about speed; it's about *purpose*.

Here is the practical difference for you:

### 1\. Pro: The "Deep Thinker" (Your Encyclopedia)

- **Its Job:** To perform deep, complex reasoning, analyse nuanced problems, and generate comprehensive, detailed outputs.It's designed for tasks like writing complex code, analysing a legal document, or producing a detailed research summary.
- **The Trap (For You):** It will happily indulge your "Collector's Fallacy." You'll ask for an idea, and it will give you a "big answer"—a beautiful, well-structured, 1000-word essay. This *feels* productive, but it's exactly the "tonnes of info that isn't actioned" you described. You are left with a new encyclopedia entry to file, not an action.
- **When to Use It:** Use Pro for **Phase 3 (Thought/Reflection)** of our A-C-T Framework. When you have *already taken action* and gathered your *own* data, and you need a "deep thinking" partner to analyse it. (e.g., "Here is my PoC test data, analyse the pros and cons").

### 2\. Flash: The "Action Partner" (Your MVA Tool)

- **Its Job:** To be fast, efficient, and "good enough." It's designed for high-volume, quick-turnaround tasks: summarising, classifying, quick Q&A, and extracting key points.
- **The Benefit (For You):** Flash is your ideal tool for **Phase 1 (Action-Goal)**. It's built to *converge* on an answer quickly. It's less likely to give you a sprawling essay and more likely to give you a concise, actionable output.
	- It's designed for *utility* over *comprehensiveness*.
	- It forces you to get to the **MVA (Minimum Viable Action)** faster, because it's not trying to "solve" the whole problem for you.
- **How it Breaks the Loop:** By being less "comprehensive," it's also less satisfying to your "Collector" brain. This is a *good thing*. It gives you the one or two bullet points you need to *act*, preventing you from falling into the "analysis paralysis" trap. It's fast, cheap, and *disposable* —it's a tool, not an oracle.

### A Practical Comparison for Your Workflow

Let's use your "k8s backup" task as an example.

| Your Action | **Using 2.5 Pro (The "Encyclopedia")** | **Using 2.5 Flash (The "Action Partner")** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MVA 1: Define Requirements** | You ask: "What do I need for a k8s backup?" | You ask: "Here's my app. List 5 requirements for its backup." |
|  | **Pro** gives you a 15-point, detailed treatise on RTO, RPO, etcd vs. PV backups, etc. You now have a "research document" to read. | **Flash** gives you: 1. Backup PVs, 2. Backup etcd, 3. Store in S3, 4. Restore in <1hr, 5. Needs to be cheap. |
|  | **Result:** You are in "learning mode." | **Result:** You are in "checklist mode." (More actionable). |
|  |  |  |
| **MVA 2: Identify Candidates** | You ask: "What are all the k8s backup tools?" | You ask: "Based on my 5-point list, what are the top 2 tools?" |
|  | **Pro** gives you a detailed comparison of 10 tools, with history, features, and pros/cons. | **Flash** gives you: "1. Velero (Free), 2. Kasten (Paid)." |
|  | **Result:** You are in "analysis paralysis" (which is better?). | **Result:** You have a clear, binary "next action" (Test Velero). |

**The difference is this:**

Using 2.5 Pro is like asking a university professor for help. You'll get a brilliant, detailed, and comprehensive lecture.

Using 2.5 Flash is like asking a busy, competent colleague. You'll get a quick, "good enough" answer that un-sticks you and lets you get on with your work.

For your goal of moving from "thinking" to "acting," **using 2.5 Flash is a mindful, tactical choice** to support that new habit. It's the "man of action's" tool.

I have switched to flash. Summarise the next experiment when doing my k8s backup solution

The next experiment is the shift from planning to **action-based learning**.

Your goal is to stop reading and start generating **actioned knowledge** by running a **Minimum Viable Action (MVA)**.

### 🧪 Summary of the Next Experiment: The Proof of Concept (PoC)

| Element | Description | Your Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Action Goal** | To test the real-world friction of a candidate tool. | Choose **one** tool from your shortlist (e.g., Velero). |
| **Time Container** | Keep the experiment short and contained. | Set a timer for **90 minutes or 2 hours**. |
| **MVA (Action)** | Install the tool and complete the simplest possible cycle. | Install the tool on a test cluster, and perform a **single backup and restore cycle** of one simple application (e.g., a basic Nginx deployment). |
| **One-Note Output** | Create a "lab report" of *actual* findings. | Create a note in Obsidian titled: `PoC Learnings - [Tool Name]`. |
| **Focus Question** | Your reflection should be on the *process*, not the features. | What was the **most painful step**? What broke? What *actually* failed/worked? |

Your success is not determined by the tool working perfectly, but by the fact that you generated **one new note of actioned knowledge** in the time container. This note will then inform the **Thought/Reflection** phase (MVA 5).

## The Thoughtful Action Framework (A-C-T)

### 🏷️ Atomic Zettelkasten Note

`UID: 202511112025` `Title: Action-Oriented Thinking: The A-C-T Framework for LLM Use` `Tags: #ADHD #productivity #LLM #synthesis #Zettelkasten #ACTFramework`

The challenge of combining divergent thinking (ADHD/LLMs) with the need for clarity is the **Collector's Fallacy**: mistaking information acquisition for knowledge integration.

The solution is the principle: **"Think like a man of action, act like a man of thought."** This is achieved by shifting from being a content consumer to a **Process Director**, using a repeatable, LLM-powered structure to force convergence and action.

---

### ⚡️ The A-C-T Framework

This three-step loop replaces over-thinking with a series of small, measurable actions (MVA) and reflections.

| Phase | Role / Core Question | LLM Prompt Function | Output / Action Artefact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A** ction | **Define the Goal:***What single action is this thinking supposed to lead to?* | **Converger:** Converts amorphous input into a **Minimum Viable Action (MVA)**. | A single, concrete MVA (e.g., 'List three expenses'). |
| **C** ontainer | **Define the Boundary:***What is the finite scope of the work?* | (Self-Prompted/Obsidian) | A **One-Note-Container Goal** in Obsidian (e.g., *'I must write one note, 100 words, titled X'*). |
| **T** hought | **Define the Insight:***What did I learn from the action I just took?* | **Synthesiser:** Analyses the raw data/results of the MVA and generates the next logical step. | A new, atomic Zettel reflecting on the data, plus the **Next MVA**. |

---

### 🛠️ Key Tactical Levers

1. **MVA (Minimum Viable Action):** Focus on the smallest, physical, concrete next step to break inertia (e.g., "Write three bullet points," not "Solve the problem").
2. **Model Selection:** Use **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for **A-Phase** actions (convergence, quick summaries, filtering). Its speed and efficiency reduce the output size, preventing the "comprehensive answer" trap that feeds the Collector's Fallacy.
3. **Action-First Learning:** Prioritise **PoC (Proof of Concept)** tests over reading (e.g., 90 minutes of *doing* on a test cluster reveals more friction than days of *reading* documentation). Knowledge is generated by action, then refined by thought.

How can I set up a workflow of local LLM agents with tailored rules for each stage? I have ollama on my MacBook but don't know how to orchestrate agents for steps like this

This is an excellent application of our framework. Automating the **A-C-T loop** with local agents is the logical next step for moving from a manual framework to a repeatable system.

Since you're using Ollama on a MacBook, the most straightforward orchestration method is through **sequential Python scripting** that utilizes the **Ollama API**. This allows you to define distinct system prompts (the "tailored rules") for each agent in the chain.

The core idea is that you are creating a simple **two-agent sequential pipeline** where the human (you) acts as the bridge (the C/Container phase).

---

## 🛠️ Orchestration Setup: Sequential Python

You do not need complex orchestration tools for this MVA. You can chain the agents using a single Python script that executes the Ollama API call for each agent, passing the output of one as the input for the next.

### 1\. Agent Definition: The System Prompt

The "tailored rules" for each agent are defined entirely by their **System Prompt**. This is the non-negotiable instruction set given to the model before it processes the user's input.

| Agent Name | A-C-T Phase | Primary Goal (System Prompt Rule) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent A-Filter** | **A (Action)** | Converge the user's amorphous input into a single, highly specific MVA (Minimum Viable Action). **Output must be one sentence: the MVA.** |
| **Agent T-Synthesiser** | **T (Thought)** | Analyse raw data provided by the user (the result of the MVA) and output a key insight and the next logical MVA. |

---

## 2\. Agent Blueprints (System Prompts)

You would set up a separate model instance or a specific system message for each stage.

### 🤖 Agent 1: The A-Filter (Phase A)

This agent's sole purpose is to enforce the MVA. It acts as the "think like a man of action" filter.

```markdown
You are an expert MVA (Minimum Viable Action) filter. Your task is to bypass the user's "Collector's Fallacy" and analysis paralysis.
When the user provides a vague, amorphous goal (e.g., "I need to learn X"), your output must be a single, highly specific, physical, and time-boxed action. Do not provide background or options.
Your entire output must be the MVA, beginning with "MVA:".

Example Output: MVA: Write a single note defining the three core requirements for the k8s backup solution in 15 minutes.
```

### 🧠 Agent 2: The T-Synthesiser (Phase T)

This agent's purpose is to enforce reflection and generate the next step. It acts as the "act like a man of thought" synthesiser.

```markdown
You are a Reflection Synthesiser. Your task is to analyse the raw, real-world data provided by the user, which is the result of their last MVA. You must convert this data into two concise, actionable takeaways.
Do not provide external research or context. Your output must be structured precisely as follows:

INSIGHT: [The single most obvious learning from the data.]
NEXT MVA: [The single, most logical next action based ONLY on the insight.]
```

---

## 3\. The Orchestration Workflow

The final workflow ties these tailored agents together (assuming you are using the `ollama run` command or a Python script calling the API):

1. **Input:** You type your amorphous thought (e.g., "Sort out finances.")
2. **Ollama Call (Agent A-Filter):**
	- `ollama run [model_name] --system "[Agent A-Filter System Prompt]" "[Your Amorphous Input]"`
	- *Output:*`MVA: List all fixed monthly expenses and income sources in a note.`
3. **Human Bridge (C-Phase):**
	- You receive the MVA, go to **Obsidian**, set a timer, and execute the MVA.
4. **Input:** You copy the raw data from your Obsidian note (the list of expenses and income).
5. **Ollama Call (Agent T-Synthesiser):**
	- `ollama run [model_name] --system "[Agent T-Synthesiser System Prompt]" "[Your Raw Data from Obsidian]"`
	- *Output:*`INSIGHT: ... NEXT MVA: ...`
6. **Loop:** The new **NEXT MVA** becomes the input for the next **C-Phase**.

This setup creates a simple, tailored, and action-oriented agent framework using the local tools you already have.

I also use the Gemini cli in the terminal. Could I do the same thing using that?

That's a very practical question. Yes, you can absolutely implement the same logic using the **Gemini CLI**, but you'll have to rely on **shell scripting** features (like `bash` or `zsh`) to handle the orchestration, as the CLI itself is designed for single-turn conversations.

The core challenge—defining the tailored rules—is solved by using the CLI's ability to include **system instructions** directly in the command.

Here's how you can execute the two-agent process using the terminal:

---

## 💻 The A-C-T Framework via Gemini CLI

The key difference is that instead of defining an agent inside a Python script, you define the agent's entire persona and ruleset **directly in the terminal command**.

### Step 1: Define the Agent Rules (System Prompts)

First, define your tailored rules (System Prompts) as shell variables. This is the "knowledge" for each agent.

Bash

```markdown
# Agent A-Filter: Defines the MVA (Action)
A_PROMPT="You are an expert MVA (Minimum Viable Action) filter. Your goal is to bypass the user's analysis paralysis. When the user provides a vague goal, your output MUST be a single, highly specific, physical, and time-boxed action. Do not provide background or options. Your entire output must be the MVA, beginning with 'MVA:'."

# Agent T-Synthesiser: Defines the Insight (Thought)
T_PROMPT="You are a Reflection Synthesiser. You must analyse the raw data provided by the user. Your output must be structured: INSIGHT: [The single most obvious learning.] NEXT MVA: [The single, most logical next action based ONLY on the insight.]"
```

---

### Step 2: Execute Agent A-Filter (Phase A)

You will call the `gemini` command, feed it the as a system instruction, and then pass the amorphous input.

1. **Execution:** Run the command below. Replace `[Your Amorphous Input]` with your messy thought (e.g., "Sort out my finances").
	Bash

	```markdown
	gemini ask --system "${A_PROMPT}" "[Your Amorphous Input]"
	```

2. **Output:** The CLI will output the result, which, due to the system prompt, should be a single, concise MVA (e.g., `MVA: List all fixed monthly expenses and income sources in a note.`).
3. **Capture the MVA (Optional):** You can capture this output into a shell variable for later reference, or just copy it manually.

---

### Step 3: Human Bridge (Phase C)

This phase remains manual. You receive the MVA from the terminal output, go to **Obsidian**, set your timer, and execute the physical action.

---

### Step 4: Execute Agent T-Synthesiser (Phase T)

After the action, you return to the CLI to reflect. You will use the second system prompt and paste the raw data you collected.

1. **Input:** Copy the contents of your Obsidian note (the raw data you collected) to your clipboard.
2. **Execution:** Run the command below. You will paste your raw data into the terminal when prompted, or you can supply it via the command line itself using pipes, though pasting interactively is often cleaner for large blocks of text.
	Bash

	```markdown
	gemini ask --system "${T_PROMPT}" "Here is the raw data collected from my last MVA. Please analyse this and give me the next action."
	```

3. **Output:** The CLI will provide the structured output (`INSIGHT:` and `NEXT MVA:`) which immediately feeds into your next action cycle.

By utilising shell variables for your tailored rules, you can effectively run a tailored two-agent pipeline entirely within your terminal environment.

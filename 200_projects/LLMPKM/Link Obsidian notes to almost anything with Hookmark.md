## Extract Key Takeaways

**Key Takeaways: "Link Obsidian notes to almost anything with Hookmark"**

- **Hookmark enables bidirectional linking** between Obsidian notes and almost any resource outside of Obsidian, such as files, emails, tasks, PDFs, and web pages on macOS.
- **Basic workflow:**
  - Use `Ctrl+H` to invoke Hookmark in any app.
  - Copy a link to a resource (e.g., a file or email) with `Cmd+C` in Hookmark.
  - Paste the link into an Obsidian note with `Cmd+V`.
  - Clicking the link in Obsidian opens the external resource.
- **Bidirectional linking:**
  - You can set up links from an Obsidian note to an external resource and vice versa using two Hookmark commands:
    - "Copy Link" in the note context.
    - "Hook to Copied Link" in the resource context.
    - This ensures you can navigate both ways.
- **Instant Obsidian note creation:**
  - With "Hook to New…" you can create a new note in Obsidian that’s automatically linked to the resource you're referencing (e.g., PDF or website).
  - The note is named after the original resource, and contains a direct link back.
- **Customizing defaults:**
  - You can set Obsidian as the default note-taking app for Hookmark, so "Hook to New" always creates Obsidian notes.
- **Hookmark files:**
  - Create plain text, editable files (like Finder aliases) containing URLs. These can be renamed, moved, or edited and point to Obsidian notes or any resource.
- **Browsing links:**
  - Search and browse all Hookmark bookmarks from the app’s interface.
- **Advanced URI linking:**
  - By default, Hookmark uses Obsidian’s URL scheme, which can break if notes are renamed.
  - For robust linking, install the Advanced URI plugin in Obsidian and configure Hookmark to use it via command line.
- **Integration and customization:**
  - Hookmark integrates with a wide variety of Mac apps (many new ones added frequently).
  - Offers extensive settings, including shortcut customization, tagging, scripting (AppleScript), bookmarking, and cross-device sync.

**Summary:** Hookmark is a powerful macOS utility that lets you tightly integrate and contextually link your Obsidian notes with anything on your Mac, dramatically expanding the scope and connectivity of your knowledge base.

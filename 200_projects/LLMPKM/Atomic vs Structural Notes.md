## Atomic Vs Structural Notes

**Summary:** Notes in a zettelkasten are divided into two mutually exclusive categories—atomic notes that contain isolated facts, and structural notes that create context by linking atomic notes together.

**Details:**

Atomic notes (also called "bricks") are context-free building blocks. Each contains one indivisible idea: a definition, a fact, a principle, or a technical specification. Atomic notes never create context by themselves; they exist to be linked.

Structural notes (also called "architecture" or "hubs") exist solely to create context. They include maps of content (MOCs), comparisons, sequences, arguments, and narratives. Structural notes have no value without referencing atomic notes via wikilinks. A structural note answers "why" and "how" atomic notes are related.

This separation is the fundamental principle that prevents knowledge bases from becoming either atomic dust (facts with no coherence) or narrative soup (ideas without verifiable building blocks).

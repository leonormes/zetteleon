## Horizons of Focus: Aligning Daily Actions with Life Purpose

The Horizons of Focus is a model from the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology that provides a framework for vertical alignment, ensuring that your daily tasks are connected to your highest-level goals and principles. It structures commitments into six distinct levels, or "altitudes," allowing you to gain perspective and make priority decisions with confidence.

Priorities cascade from the top down: your purpose (H5) informs your vision (H4), which shapes your goals (H3), which defines your areas of responsibility (H2), which generates your projects (H1), which are executed through your daily actions (Ground).

### The Six Horizons

1. **Ground: Current Actions (The Runway)**
   - **Scope:** The complete inventory of all physical, visible activities you need to do—emails, calls, errands. This is where the "real work" happens.
   - **Function:** You don't *do* projects; you *do* actions. This level represents the tangible expression of all higher-level commitments. Clarity here is essential for day-to-day execution.
   - **Review Frequency:** Daily.

2. **Horizon 1: Current Projects (10,000 ft)**
   - **Scope:** Any desired outcome that requires more than one action step and can be completed within a year. This is your list of "open loops."
   - **Function:** This inventory generates the majority of your next actions. A complete and current projects list is the engine of the Weekly Review, ensuring no commitments are dropped.
   - **Review Frequency:** Weekly.

3. **Horizon 2: Areas of Focus and Accountability (20,000 ft)**
   - **Scope:** The key roles and responsibilities in your life that you must maintain to a certain standard. These are not completable projects but ongoing areas like "Health," "Finances," "Parenting," or "Team Leadership."
   - **Function:** This horizon acts as a checklist to ensure balance across your life. Reviewing these areas helps you identify neglected parts of your life and can trigger new projects needed to get them back on track.
   - **Review Frequency:** Monthly.

4. **Horizon 3: Goals and Objectives (30,000 ft)**
   - **Scope:** Concrete, measurable outcomes you want to achieve in the next 1-2 years. These are the major stepping stones toward your long-term vision.
   - **Function:** Goals provide medium-term direction and focus. They bridge the gap between your long-term vision and your current projects, helping you decide which new projects to take on.
   - **Review Frequency:** Quarterly.

5. **Horizon 4: Vision (40,000 ft)**
   - **Scope:** A compelling picture of what success looks like 3-5 years in the future, across key life domains (career, personal, relationships).
   - **Function:** The vision acts as a guiding star. It provides the "why" behind your goals and helps you make major life decisions by asking, "Does this move me closer to my envisioned future?"
   - **Review Frequency:** Annually.

6. **Horizon 5: Purpose and Principles (50,000 ft)**
   - **Scope:** The ultimate "why." This is your life's purpose and the core, non-negotiable principles you live by.
   - **Function:** This is the ultimate criterion for all decision-making. Your principles define what "success" and "a life well-lived" even mean. All lower horizons must be in alignment with this one.
   - **Review Frequency:** As needed for clarity, but the principles themselves should be stable.

### Defining Your Horizons: A Top-Down Process

Defining your horizons is a process of deep reflection, moving from the abstract to the concrete.

1. **Start with H5 (Principles):** Use exercises like the "Funeral Visualization" to connect with your deepest values. What character do you want to embody? What contribution do you want to make? Formalize this into a **Personal Mission Statement**.
2. **Define H4 (Vision):** Based on your principles, ask: "If I lived these principles perfectly, what would my life look like in 3-5 years?" Describe this future state in vivid detail across your key life areas.
3. **Set H3 (Goals):** Look at your vision and ask: "What major outcomes must I achieve in the next 1-2 years to make that vision a reality?" These goals should be specific and measurable.
4. **Review H2 (Areas of Focus):** Your goals and vision will clarify which areas of your life require consistent attention. Ensure you have a complete list of your roles and responsibilities.
5. **Generate H1 (Projects):** Your goals and areas of focus will generate projects. A goal like "Get promoted to Principal Engineer" will spawn projects like "Complete AWS Certification" and "Lead the 'Phoenix' Project."

By regularly reviewing these horizons, you ensure that the action you are taking today is a meaningful step toward the life you ultimately want to live.

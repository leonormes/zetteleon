## Learning Principles and Practices

The goal is to produce a structured framework that can be used as a prompt for an LLM to assist in your learning process.

Distilling Learning Principles and Practices

The provided materials highlight a multitude of interconnected strategies for effective learning, combining insights from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and practical experience. These strategies can be broadly categorised into:

### 1\. Understanding Learning Mechanisms

- Focused vs. Diffuse Modes: The brain alternates between focused and diffuse modes of thinking. Focused mode is used for working on familiar problems and loading new material into the brain, while diffuse mode is for processing new challenges and making connections. Learning often involves moving back and forth between these modes. When stuck, shifting to diffuse mode through breaks or different activities allows for background processing. Oddly, one can be in focused mode on one topic and diffuse mode on another.
- Neural Connections: Learning involves creating and strengthening connections between neurons. The more connections and the more varied the contexts, the deeper the understanding. These connections form a “web of learning”.
- Declarative vs. Procedural Learning: There are two ways to deposit neural links in long-term memory: declarative (conscious, quick-to-learn, involves working memory) and procedural (unconscious, intuitive, pattern-detecting). Declarative memory is used to get started with learning, while procedural memory allows for faster and more intuitive handling. Internalizing information allows the procedural system to detect different patterns.
- Working Memory: Working memory is limited and can be easily overwhelmed. Simplifying material, breaking it into chunks, and using task lists to offload thoughts can improve working memory capacity.

### 2\. Active Learning Techniques

- Retrieval Practice: Actively recalling information from memory is more effective than passively reviewing it. The more you retrieve information, and the broader the context, the stronger the neural links become. This includes working problems without looking at the solutions, testing oneself, and explaining concepts in simple terms. Retrieval is key to developing intuition. Free recall, where you write down everything you can remember, is also a useful tactic.
- Elaboration: Explaining concepts in your own words, as if teaching them to someone else, deepens understanding. Simplifying, improving, and providing examples are all parts of elaboration. This helps to create more connections to existing knowledge. Self-explaining steps, particularly when solving problems, is very effective.
- Interleaving: Mixing different subjects or types of problems during study sessions to help with building intuition and speed. This helps in differentiating between concepts.
- The Peter Method: A four-step notetaking process that involves normal note-taking, summarising in your own words, connecting information to the broader lesson, and then summarizing each section again. This encourages critical analysis and deeper understanding.
- Structured Analysis Method: Involves taking notes and then analyzing and criticising each bit of information. This method is similar to the Peter method, but less time-consuming.
- Spaced Repetition: Breaking learning into shorter sessions over several days instead of one long session. Reviewing material at increasing intervals helps consolidate memories.
- Self-Generated Challenges Creating challenges for yourself to solve later in order to practice a skill, not merely remember information.
- The Feynman Technique: A method for developing intuition by explaining an idea in detail. Identify what you want to understand, explain it simply, identify gaps in your knowledge, and then simplify further through analogies or visualizations.

### 3\. Strategic Planning and Execution

- Metalearning: Before diving into a topic, research how to learn it effectively. This involves understanding your motivations, the required knowledge and abilities, and the best resources and methods. Metalearning can be broken down into “Why?”, “What?”, and “How?” questions.
- Directness: Learning by doing the thing you want to become good at. Learning activities should have a strong connection to the context where the skills will be used. Favour project based learning, learning directly from the source materials.
- Focus: Cultivate the ability to concentrate and minimise distractions. Create dedicated time for learning and use strategies such as the Pomodoro Technique to maintain focus.
- Drill: Identify weak points and practice them in isolation to improve specific sub-skills. Drills can improve specific components of performance, which can then be re-integrated into broader skills. A “direct-then-drill” approach helps in alternating between broad practice and specific skill development. Drills should be mindful and have a clear purpose. Use methods like the magnifying glass method to spend more time on the weak parts of your skill.
- Feedback: Seek out feedback on your performance to identify areas for improvement.
- Retention: Use strategies like spaced repetition, active recall and proceduralization to retain knowledge long-term.
- Intuition: Develop a deep understanding of the subject rather than just memorizing facts. Use techniques such as the Feynman technique to build intuition.
- Experimentation Continuously try new approaches and methods to discover what works best for you and your learning objectives.
- Macro and Micro Planning: Develop both a macro-level plan that addresses why you are learning and a micro-level plan that outlines daily activities.
- Task Lists: Utilize task lists to offload thoughts from working memory and focus on the task at hand.
- Chunking: Break learning material into smaller, manageable chunks.

### 4\. Overcoming the Illusion of Explanatory Depth

- Active Engagement: Avoid passive reading by actively thinking about the content and connecting it to what you already know. Summarise in your own words, use elaboration, discuss the content with others, and answer questions. Rereading should be supplemented with active learning methods.
- Questioning: Be a “question master”. Ask probing questions to get behind facts, motivations, and context. Use Socratic questions to challenge assumptions and Bloom’s Taxonomy to analyze and evaluate information.
- Concrete Examples and Analogies: Link new knowledge to things you already know by creating analogies and concrete examples. Examples force application, revealing gaps in your knowledge.

### 5\. Additional Tactics

- Visual Learning The brain is highly visual, and using vivid images can aid in memory.
- Stories Creating stories to help memorise items on a list, as this creates meaningful connections instead of trying to memorize dry facts.
- Changing Locations Varying the location where you study can create a wider set of hooks for information to remain in your brain.
- Doodling Doodling and drawing can have a positive effect on understanding.

### Prompt for LLM

Based on the above distillation, here is a structured prompt you can use to guide your learning process with the help of an LLM:

#### Initial Setup

- Topic: \[Enter the specific topic or skill you want to learn\].
- Goal: \[Define your learning goal \- be specific e.g., to explain X, build Y, etc.\].
- Motivation: \[Explain why you are learning this (instrumental vs. intrinsic)\].

#### Metalearning Phase

1. “Why” Questions:

   - Why am I learning this?
   - How does this align with my overall goals?
   - What specific outcomes am I aiming for?

2. “What” Questions:

   - What are the key concepts, facts, and procedures I need to learn?
   - Which of these will likely be the most challenging?
   - Can I break down the topic into smaller, manageable components?

3. “How” Questions:

   - What are the common methods for learning this topic?
   - What resources are typically used for this topic (textbooks, courses, etc.)?
   - Are there expert learners I can learn from?

#### Active Learning Phase

1. Retrieval Practice:

   - Summarize the material covered in a specific session in my own words.
   - Generate practice questions about the core concepts.
   - Work through examples and problems without looking at the solutions.
   - Use free recall to write down everything I remember after studying.

2. Elaboration:

   - Explain this concept as if teaching it to someone unfamiliar with the subject.
   - Provide examples, analogies and illustrations for the concepts
   - Explain why I am doing each step while practicing problem sets.

3. Interleaving:

   - Mix different concepts or types of problems during practice sessions.
   - Alternate between related tasks to identify distinctions.

4. Deep Processing:

   - Use the Peter Method of note-taking to organize key ideas and analyse them.
   - Use the Structured Analysis method to create lateral connections between ideas.
   - When working with information, spend 50% or more of my time processing, not consuming.

5. The Feynman Technique:

   - Choose a concept, and try to explain it in simple terms.
   - Where do I struggle? What details am I unsure about?
   - What are the most effective analogies or examples to use to explain the idea to someone with less knowledge?
   - Are there visualisations or other illustrative techniques that can make the abstract concepts more concrete?

#### Direct Practice and Drill

1. Directness:

   - How can I practice this skill in a way that closely resembles how I will use it in real situations?
   - Can I structure a project around the application of this skill?
   - How can I engage with the source material instead of relying on indirect interpretations?

2. Drills:

   - What specific components of this skill are the most difficult for me?
   - How can I isolate those components and practice them separately?
   - Am I mindfully drilling, or is my practice lacking purpose or context?
   - How can I use the “Magnifying Glass Method” to give more time to any weak areas?

#### General Reminders

- Focus: Use the Pomodoro technique to maintain concentration. Eliminate distractions to get into a flow state.
- Feedback: Seek out feedback and criticism on my approach and performance.
- Retention: Use spaced repetition to review previously learned material.
- Intuition: Focus on building a deep understanding and seek connections between concepts.
- Working Memory: Keep my environment clear of distractions. Use lists to store thoughts and ideas for later. Break down information into manageable chunks.
- Flexibility: Experiment with different learning methods and be willing to adjust based on results.
- Visual Imagery: Use visualisations or mind-maps to clarify ideas and remember important details.
- Stories When memorizing lists, create a story to make meaningful connections.

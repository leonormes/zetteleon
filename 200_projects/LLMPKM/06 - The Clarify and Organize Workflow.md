## The Clarify & Organize Workflow: The Heart of the System

The **Clarify** and **Organize** stages of GTD are the most critical for system trust and the most common failure point, especially for an ADHD brain. This is the "thinking" work that transforms a chaotic inbox of captured "stuff" into a structured, actionable system. A robust, low-friction workflow here is non-negotiable.

### The Core Problem: The Clarification Bottleneck

Capturing ideas is easy and provides a dopamine hit. Clarifying them is cognitively demanding work. This friction leads to a bottleneck where the inbox grows, trust in the system erodes, and the mind reverts to holding "stuff," causing anxiety.

The solution is to treat clarification not as a single, monolithic task but as a guided, almost game-like, and repeatable process.

### The Workflow: From Unclarified "Stuff" to Organized Action

This workflow is designed to be facilitated by an LLM "Chief of Staff" (CoS) but can be performed manually. It systematically processes each item from the inbox to a definitive conclusion.

#### Step 1: The Triage Session

Schedule frequent, short "micro-clarify" sessions (e.g., 10-15 minutes daily) rather than one long, daunting weekly session. For each item in your inbox, ask the first critical GTD question:

**Question 1: "What is it?"**
Briefly describe the item to move it from a vague thought to a concrete concept.

**Question 2: "Is it actionable?"**
This is the primary fork in the road.

#### Path A: The Item is NOT Actionable

If the answer is **No**, it can only be one of three things:

1. **Trash/Delete:** It's no longer relevant or needed.
2. **Reference:** It's useful information to keep. File it in your reference system (e.g., Obsidian) with appropriate tags.
3. **Incubation (Someday/Maybe):** It's an idea you might want to act on later. Move it to a "Someday/Maybe" list to be reviewed periodically.

---

#### Path B: The Item IS Actionable

If the answer is **Yes**, proceed down the action path with the LLM CoS guiding you through the **Natural Planning Model**.

**Question 3: "What is the desired outcome?" (The Project)**

- If the item can be completed in a single step, it's just an action.
- If it requires **more than one step**, it is a **Project**.
- The desired outcome must be defined clearly. What does "done" look like? This becomes the project's goal.

**Question 4: "What is the Next Action?"**

- This is the single, next *physical, visible action* required to move the project forward.
- **The 2-Minute Rule:** If this action takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.
- **The Momentum Method:** If the Next Action feels too big or daunting, break it down further until you have a ridiculously small **`@starter_task`** (e.g., "Open a new document," "Find the phone number"). This is the key to overcoming task-initiation friction.

#### Step 2: Organize the Outputs

Once clarified, the items are organized into their proper homes.

- **Projects** are planned in **Obsidian**. A dedicated project note should be created containing:
  - The **Purpose** (Why?) and **Vision** (What does "done" look like?).
  - A **Brainstorm Dump** of all possible steps.
  - An **Organized Plan**, grouping steps into logical phases or action sequences.
  - The defined **Next Actions**, ready to be dispatched to the execution tool.
- **Next Actions** are dispatched to **Todoist**. Each action must be enriched with metadata:
  - **Contexts:** `@DeepWork`, `@QuickWins`, `@Calls`, `@Offline`, etc.
  - **Energy Level:** `#energy-low`, `#energy-medium`, `#energy-high`.
  - **Time Estimate:** `#t-5min`, `#t-15min`, etc.
  - **Special Tags:** `@starter_task` for momentum-building actions.

#### Step 3: The Handoff and Trust

Once an item is clarified and organized, you must **trust the system** to hold it. The thought is no longer your responsibility to remember; it is the system's. This trust is only earned through consistent execution of the final GTD stage: **Review**. A regular review process ensures that nothing is ever truly lost, which is what allows your mind to finally let go.

## Extract Key Takeaways

**Key Takeaways from "Zettelkasten for Programmers" (ZazenCodes):**

- **Problem:** Programmers frequently re-search the same info (e.g., git commands, code patterns), and rely on bookmarks/cheat sheets that aren't always at hand.
- **Solution:** The creator built a Zettelkasten-inspired note system focused on *quick, keyboard-driven knowledge capture and retrieval*, tightly integrated with the terminal and Vim.

**Workflow Steps:**

- Capture new facts, code snippets, commands, or answers *immediately* when solving problems—no mouse required.
- Title the note, add context/tags (e.g., fact, hub like "git" or "JavaScript"), optionally reference the original source (URL).
- Store all new notes in an "inbox" for later processing.

**System Features:**

- Use fuzzy-finding (like Vim Telescope) to rapidly search and resurface stored knowledge or code examples.
- Hubs and tags organize knowledge logically by domain (Python, Linux, machine learning, etc.).
- Notes are sorted and stored by category (facts, references, blog, etc.), with periodic reviews for filing/discarding.

**Key Principles:**

- Standardize how knowledge is captured so it's easily reusable and referenceable.
- Separate high-effort notes (like detailed book summaries) from quick jotted 'facts' for efficient organization.
- Cheat sheet notes grow over time and become reference anchors.

**Automation:**

- Custom scripts automate both the note-taking and organizational processes, including syncing with tools like Obsidian and Notion.

**Benefits:**

- Immediate recall and reuse of technical solutions—no re-Googling.
- Scalable structure thanks to tags/hubs and logical file separation.
- Suits terminal-centric, keyboard-driven workflows for programmers.

**Final Questions:**

- The creator invites viewers to consider: *What one thing from this system would you implement in your own workflow?*

This system directly supports **ADHD-friendly, fast-capture, low-friction knowledge workflows**, leveraging automation and keyboard navigation—making it highly relevant for technical users aiming for "Mind Like Water" productivity.

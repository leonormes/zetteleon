## FITFILE Technical Pack Documentation Project

### Project Overview

This project transforms existing FITFILE technical documentation into a professional, customer-ready technical pack optimized for deployment use.

### Folder Structure

```sh
doc/
├── inputs/           # Original source documents (preserved)
├── intermediate/     # Working documents and analysis
├── final/           # Finished deliverables
├── assets/
│   ├── diagrams/    # Architecture and process diagrams
│   └── references/  # Supporting materials
└── styles/          # Style guides and templates
```

### Build Workflow

1. **Analysis Phase**: Extract and inventory content from source materials
2. **Structure Phase**: Design optimized outline based on industry best practices
3. **Content Phase**: Map existing content to new structure and fill gaps
4. **Quality Phase**: Review, validate, and polish for customer consumption
5. **Delivery Phase**: Generate final documents in multiple formats

### Key Deliverables

- Comprehensive FITFILE Technical Pack (Markdown + PDF)
- Architecture diagrams and technical matrices
- Change log and maintenance documentation
- Quality assurance artifacts

### Process Notes

- All changes are tracked and reversible
- Industry best practices guide document structure
- Content validated against FITFILE technical facts
- Multi-audience approach (architects, infra teams, security, PMs)

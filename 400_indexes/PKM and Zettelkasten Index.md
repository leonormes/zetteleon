### 📋 Implementation Notes

This index represents your distributed thinking about PKM and Zettelkasten systems. The notes span from philosophical foundations to practical implementation, with particular attention to ADHD-specific considerations and LLM integration possibilities.

#### Key Themes Identified

1. **Process over Product** - Emphasis on thinking process rather than polished outputs
2. **ADHD Adaptations** - Specific modifications for ADHD cognitive patterns
3. **Connection-Centric** - Focus on meaningful linking over categorization
4. **LLM Integration** - Exploration of AI-assisted knowledge work
5. **Cognitive Offloading** - Systematic externalization of mental processes

#### Suggested Next Steps

- Review notes marked as "seedling" or underdeveloped
- Identify gaps between theory and practice
- Consolidate duplicate concepts
- Develop implementation roadmaps from planning notes

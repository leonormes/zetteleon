## ProdOS - Map of Content

> [!hint] Navigation Guide
> **Start here** to navigate the ProdOS ecosystem. This map routes you to the authoritative **Source of Truth (SoT)** for each domain.

---

### 1. The Core Architecture (The Kernel)

The definitive specification of the system, its biological basis, and the "Why".

-   **[[SoT - PRODOS (System Architecture)]]** — *The Master Canon. Defines the shift from Storage (Museum) to Compute (Factory).*
-   **[[SoT - PRODOS - The Cognitive Loop (A-C-T Framework)]]** — *The core workflow for interacting with LLMs (Action -> Container -> Thought).*
-   **[[SoT - PRODOS - Problem-Solution Map]]** — *The justification for every feature (Mapping ADHD deficits to ProdOS solutions).*
-   **[[SoT - The Cognitive Physiology of Task Execution]]** — *The biological basis for the 5 phases of work (Initiation -> Planning -> Execution).*

---

### 2. Phase 1: Capture & Routing (Input)

How to ingest the world without getting overwhelmed.

-   **[[SoT - PRODOS - The Tri-State Router]]** — *The routing logic: Is this Kinetic (Action), Static (Storage), or Dynamic (Thinking)?*
-   **[[SoT - PRODOS - Problem Architecture]]** — *Defining "Problems" (Gap + Unknown) vs. "Tasks" (Gap + Known).*

---

### 3. Phase 2: Thinking & Synthesis (Processor)

How to turn raw confusion into structured insight.

-   **[[SoT - PRODOS - Knowledge Synthesis (Thinking)]]** — *The protocol for refining "Mental Models" and externalizing thought.*
-   **[[SoT - The Unified Writing to Think Process]]** — *Using writing as a tool for discovery.*
-   **[[SoT - Capturing Context (The Machinery of Thinking)]]** — *Techniques for preserving mental state across sessions.*
-   **[[SoT - The Extended Mind]]** — *Why we offload cognition (Cumulative vs. Cyclical thinking).*

---

### 4. Phase 3: Execution & Time (Output)

How to transform intent into reality.

-   **[[SoT - PRODOS - Action Management (GTD)]]** — *The workflow for separation of concerns (Obsidian for Thinking vs. Todoist for Doing).*
-   **[[SoT - Temporal Management (Blocking and Boxing)]]** — *The protocol for Time Blocking (Strategic) and Time Boxing (Tactical).*
-   **[[SoT - The Honeyman Method (Adaptive Routines)]]** — *Managing energy tiers (Ideal vs. Survival mode).*
-   **[[SoT - Bridging the Intention-Action Gap]]** — *Psychological protocols for overcoming activation energy.*

---

### 5. Phase 4: Feedback & Identity (Loop)

How to sustain the system and grow.

-   **[[SoT - Identity-Based Habit Formation]]** — *Dismantling negative beliefs ("I am lazy") and building "Repeated Beingness."*
-   **[[SoT - PRODOS - System Failure Modes]]** — *Why traditional systems fail ADHD brains (The "Shoulder Massage" Trap).*
-   **[[SoT - Process Primacy (Systems Over Goals)]]** — *Why systems beat willpower.*

---

### 6. Applied Life Systems

Specific implementations of ProdOS principles.

-   **[[SoT - Family Budgeting System]]** — *The "Spendfulness" protocol.*

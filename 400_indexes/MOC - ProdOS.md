## ProdOS - Map of Content

> [!hint] Navigation Guide
> **Start here** to navigate the ProdOS ecosystem. This map routes you to the authoritative **Source of Truth (SoT)** for each domain.

### 1. The Core System (Start Here)

The definitive specification of the system, its architecture, and the "Why".

-   **[[SoT - PRODOS (System Architecture)]]** — *The Master Canon. Read this for the complete overview.*
-   **[[SoT - PRODOS - Problem-Solution Map]]** — *The justification for every feature (Mapping ADHD deficits to ProdOS solutions).*

### 2. Operational Manuals (The "How-To")

Guides for the specific workflows you perform daily.

#### ⚡️ Action & Execution (GTD)
*How to capture, process, and execute tasks.*
-   **[[SoT - PRODOS - The Tri-State Router]]** — *The core logic for processing inputs (Kinetic vs. Static vs. Dynamic).*
-   **[[SoT - Bridging the Intention-Action Gap]]** — *The psychological protocol for overcoming initiation paralysis (Activation Energy).*

#### 🧠 Thinking & Synthesis
*How to turn raw thoughts into structured insights.*
-   **[[SoT - PRODOS - The Cognitive Loop (A-C-T Framework)]]** — *The standard operating procedure for interacting with LLMs.*
-   **[[SoT - The Unified Writing to Think Process]]** — *The protocol for using writing as a tool for discovery (Type A vs. Type B).*
-   **[[SoT - Evolutionary Note System]]** — *How notes mature from "Head" to "SoT" (The Integration Queue).*
-   **[[SoT - Capturing Context (The Machinery of Thinking)]]** — *Techniques for preserving mental state across sessions.*

### 3. Foundational Concepts (The "Why")

The psychological and cognitive principles underpinning the system.

#### 🧠 Cognition & Learning
-   **[[SoT - The Extended Mind]]** — *Why we offload cognition to the system (Cumulative vs. Cyclical thinking).*
-   **[[SoT - Working Memory & Schema Theory]]** — *The biological bottleneck and how we bypass it.*
-   **[[SoT - Learning Mechanisms]]** — *Focused vs. Diffuse modes and the path to Procedural Memory.*

#### 🏗️ Behavior & Habits
-   **[[SoT - Identity-Based Habit Formation]]** — *Focusing on who you are, not what you achieve.*
-   **[[SoT - The Four Laws of Behavior Change]]** — *The mechanical framework for building/breaking habits (Atomic Habits).*
-   **[[SoT - Process Primacy (Systems Over Goals)]]** — *Why systems beat willpower (The Water Metaphor).*

#### 🎯 Philosophy of Action
-   **[[SoT - What is a Problem]]** — *Defining the "Gap + Uncertainty" to stop solutioneering.*
-   **[[SoT - Think Like a Man of Action, Act Like a Man of Thought]]** — *The guiding aphorism for balancing planning and doing.*

### 4. Maintenance & Quality
-   **[[SoT - PRODOS (System Architecture)#5. Trust & Verifiability: The Acceptance Criteria|The Acceptance Criteria]]** — *How to verify the system is working (The 60-Second Test).*

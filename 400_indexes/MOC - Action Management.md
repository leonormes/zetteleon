## MOC - Action Management

> **Core Question:** How do we transform abstract intent into concrete reality?

This Map of Content (MOC) aggregates the principles, systems, and strategies for managing action within the ProdOS ecosystem. It is designed specifically to counter **ADHD Task Initiation Deficits** by enforcing a strict separation between *Thinking* (Obsidian) and *Doing* (Todoist).

### 1. The ProdOS System (The How)

The canonical system for managing actions is defined here:

- **[[SoT - PRODOS - Action Management (GTD)]]**: The "Source of Truth" detailing the 4-phase workflow (Capture -> Refine -> Bridge -> Engage).
- **[[SoT - PRODOS - The Cognitive Loop (A-C-T Framework)]]**: The theoretical model of how Action (A), Context (C), and Thought (T) interact.

**How ProdOS Helps:**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Prevents "ToDo List Clutter" by keeping thinking in Obsidian and actions in Todoist.
- **Context Preservation:** Uses the **Context Bridge** to link Todoist tasks back to the Obsidian note, solving the "What was I doing?" problem.
- **Refinement:** Uses the LLM to "lint" vague tasks into atomic next actions before they enter the runtime.

### 2. The Atomic Unit (The What)

Productivity is built on the "Atomic Action."

- **[[MOC - Atomic Actions and Next Actions Framework]]**: A deep dive into what makes an action "Atomic" and "Doable."
- **[[Atomic Actions Have Four Core Properties]]**: Indivisible, Physical, Binary, Context-Specific.
- **[[Atomic Action Completion Must Be Binary and Instantly Verifiable]]**: The rule that prevents vague "Work on X" tasks.

### 3. The Neurological Challenge (The Why)

Understanding *why* action is hard is critical to solving it.

- **[[MOC - The Neurological Basis of Task Initiation Difficulty in ADHD]]**: Explains the dopamine dysregulation that causes paralysis.
- **TPN vs. DMN**: The switch from "Thinking" (Default Mode Network) to "Doing" (Task Positive Network) is sticky. Externalizing the task to Todoist helps trigger this switch.
- **Purpose vs. Feelings**: Shifting from "What do I feel like doing?" (Limbic) to "What needs to be done?" (Prefrontal/Purpose-centered).
- **[[Activation Energy is the Primary Barrier to ADHD Task Initiation]]**: The "Wall of Awful" concept.
- **[[ADHD Causes Task Initiation Deficits Due to Dopamine Hyposensitivity]]**: The biological root cause.
- **[[MOC - Breaking the ADHD Overthinking-Procrastination Cycle]]**: Strategies to break the paralysis loop.

### 4. Strategies for Initiation (The Fix)

Techniques to lower activation energy and start moving.

- **[[The Starter Task Overcomes Activation Energy for ADHD]]**: The concept of the "stupidly small" first step.
- **[[Action Triggers Bridge the Gap Between Motion and Action]]**: Setting up the environment to force action.
- **[[Micro-Stepping Reduces Cognitive Load for Task Initiation]]**: Breaking a task down until it feels "too easy to fail."
- **[[Implementation Intentions Automate Action Initiation with If-Then Plans]]**: Pre-deciding when and where to act.

### 5. Related Concepts
- **[[SoT - Bridging the Intention-Action Gap]]**: The philosophical gap between "wanting" and "doing."
- **[[MOC - Time Boxing for ADHD Brains]]**: Using time constraints to force focus.
- **[[Distraction Management in Timeboxing (Catch-All List)]]**: Handling interruptions during action blocks.

### Highlights
- Incorrectly interpreting rustling from the wind as an oncoming lion is called a type I error, a false positive. The consequences of such an error were much less grave than those of a type II error, a false negative. A false negative could have been fatal: hearing rustling and always assuming it’s the wind would have gotten our ancestors eaten, and we wouldn’t be here.

- When we work backward from results to figure out why those things happened, we are susceptible to a variety of cognitive traps, like assuming causation when there is only a correlation, or cherry-picking data to confirm the narrative we prefer.

- The differences between the systems are more than just labels. Automatic processing originates in the evolutionarily older parts of the brain, including the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and amygdala. Our deliberative mind operates out of the prefrontal cortex. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=243))
- Both deliberative and reflexive mind are necessary for our survival and advancement. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=254))
- The Boston Public Library’s list of the “100 Most Influential Books of the Century” includes Theory of Games. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=320))

- Poker, in contrast, is a game of incomplete information. It is a game of decision-making under conditions of uncertainty over time. (Not coincidentally, that is close to the definition of game theory.) ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=353))
- Von Neumann and Morgenstern understood that the world doesn’t easily reveal the objective truth. That’s why they based game theory on poker. Making better decisions starts with understanding this: uncertainty can work a lot of mischief. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=378))
- Just as we have problems with resulting and hindsight bias, when we evaluate decisions solely on how they turn out, we have a mirror-image problem in making prospective decisions. We get only one try at any given decision—one flip of the coin—and that puts great pressure on us to feel we have to be certain before acting, a certainty that necessarily will overlook the influences of hidden information and luck.

- “The Pursuit of Ignorance.”) ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=431))
- What makes a decision great is not that it has a great outcome. A great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge. That state of knowledge, in turn, is some variation of “I’m not sure.” ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=434))
- What good poker players and good decision-makers have in common is their comfort with the world being an uncertain and unpredictable place. They understand that they can almost never know exactly how something will turn out. They embrace that uncertainty and, instead of focusing on being sure, they try to figure out how unsure they are, making their best guess at the chances that different outcomes will occur. The accuracy of those guesses will depend on how much information they have and how experienced they are at making such guesses. This is part of the basis of all bets. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=443))
- Second, being wrong hurts us more than being right feels good. We know from Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky’s work on loss aversion, part of prospect theory (which won Kahneman the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002), that losses in general feel about two times as bad as wins feel good. So winning $100 at blackjack feels as good to us as losing $50 feels bad to us. Because being right feels like winning and being wrong feels like losing, that means we need two favorable results for every one unfavorable result just to break even emotionally. Why not live a smoother existence, without the swings, especially when the losses affect us more intensely than the wins?

## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Definition
> **Identity-Based Habit Formation** is the principle that long-term behavioral change is sustained not by focusing on outcomes ("I want to lose weight") but by shifting self-image ("I am a healthy person").
>
> Habits are not just tools for results; they are the **evidence** that reinforces a new identity. Identity serves as the **North Star** of habit change, guiding the entire process.

## 2. The Three Layers of Behavior Change (The Onion Model)

Change happens at three levels, often visualized as layers of an onion, ordered from surface to core:

1.  **Outcomes (Surface):** Changing results (e.g., losing 10kg, publishing a book). About what you **get**.
2.  **Process (System):** Changing habits and systems (e.g., gym routine, writing schedule). About what you **do**.
3.  **Identity (Core):** Changing beliefs, worldview, and self-image (e.g., "I am a runner"). About what you **believe**.

**The Failure Mode:** Most people focus on Outcome-Based Habits (working from the outside in).
**The Correction:** Sustained change requires **Identity-Based Habits** (working from the inside out).

## 3. The Mechanism: Repeated Beingness

The word *identity* derives from the Latin *essentitas* (being) and *identidem* (repeatedly). Identity is literally **"Repeated Beingness."** It is not fixed at birth; it is malleable and emerges from your actions.

-   **The Vote:** Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
-   **The Accumulation:** No single instance transforms you, but as votes accumulate, the evidence shifts your self-image.
-   **The Feedback Loop:**
    `Habits → Evidence → Beliefs → Identity → (reinforces) Habits`

> "The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation occurs when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this." — James Clear

## 4. The Two-Step Process

1.  **Decide the type of person you want to be.**
    -   Ask: "Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?"
2.  **Prove it to yourself with small wins.**
    -   Every small action acts as proof. "What would a healthy person do?"

## 5. Dismantling Negative Beliefs (The ADHD Protocol)

For neurodivergent minds, deep-seated identity beliefs ("I am lazy," "I am a procrastinator") create a "Repeated Beingness" of failure. To dismantle these:

### A. The Origin of Doubt

Often, these beliefs are not yours. A bad teacher or parent may have installed a doubt ("You cannot") that continues to sting years later. The "discursive meanderings of your inner voice" may insist on failure despite evidence to the contrary.

-   **The Fix:** Recognize the voice as an external script, not an internal truth.

### B. Identify and Edit

Recognize the blanket statement ("I'm always late") and deliberately choose a new identity ("I am the person who shows up").

-   **Reframing:** Change "I *have* to work" (Burden) to "I *get* to build skills" (Opportunity).

### C. The Minimum Viable Habit (MVH)

To cast a vote for a new identity without triggering ADHD paralysis, use the **Two-Minute Rule**. The goal is to master *showing up*, not the result.

-   *Identity Goal:* "I am a writer." -> *MVH:* "Open my notes." (Not "Write for 2 hours").
-   *Identity Goal:* "I am tidy." -> *MVH:* "Put one item away."
-   *Principle:* A habit must be established before it can be improved. Standardize, then optimize.

### D. Friction Engineering
-   **Make it Easy (Good Identity):** Prime the environment (e.g., leave the laptop open).
-   **Make it Hard (Bad Identity):** Increase friction (e.g., phone in another room).

## 6. Managing Resistance & Setbacks

The "Childish Mind" will rebel against discomfort. Use these protocols to stay on the path:

### A. The "Never Miss Twice" Rule

The first mistake is an accident; the second is the start of a new identity.

-   **Protocol:** If you miss a day, your *only* job the next day is to perform the MVH. Return to the identity immediately.

### B. The "Quit on the Third Time" Technique

When the urge to quit arises during a task:

1.  **First Urge:** Pause, notice it, continue.
2.  **Second Urge:** Pause, notice it, continue.
3.  **Third Urge:** Permission granted to stop.
-   *Why:* This builds "Distress Tolerance" without forcing a shame spiral.

## 7. Identity as a Barrier (The Conflict)

While identity drives good habits, **Old Identity Sabotage** prevents growth.

-   **Cognitive Slumber:** Accepting self-limiting norms ("I'm bad at names," "I'm disorganized") creates internal pressure to remain consistent with that image.
-   **Brittleness:** Tying identity to a role ("I am the CEO") makes one fragile. Identity should be tied to adaptable traits ("I am the type of person who solves problems").
-   **The Fix:** You must continuously **edit your beliefs** and upgrade your identity to match your growth.

## 8. Analogy

> Thinking about identity when building habits is like choosing the **blueprint** for a house before laying the foundation.
>
> -   **Identity-Focus:** Starts with a strong blueprint ("I am a healthy person"). Every brick (habit) reinforces the structure.
> -   **Outcome-Focus:** Lays bricks randomly hoping they eventually look like a mansion. The structure is weak and crumbles under stress.

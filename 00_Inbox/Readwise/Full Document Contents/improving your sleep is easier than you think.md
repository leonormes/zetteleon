Millions of people suffer from a lack ofsleep, which can be linked to heartdisease, diabetes, depression, andshorter life. While you sleep, your bodybuilds muscle, your mind gets clearer,and your energy levels increase. Withoutsleep, however, all of that starts tobreak down. Sleep deprivation actuallyhas similar effects on the brain asbeing drunk. You’ve been wasting yourmoney all these years on tequila whenyou could have just been crushingespresso shots. How much have you had tosleep tonight, sir? None. None at all.That’s what I thought. Get them. If youwant to get deeper into all the reasonssleep is important, you should check outthe book "Why We Sleep" by Matthew Walker.It’s a really fascinating book, butTL;DR, it says you should get about 8hours of sleep every night.

Okay, so there’s a lot of sleep myths out there.Let’s start by clearing those up. A lotof people think they can catch up onsleep over the weekend. This is notreally the case. You might be able tofeel a bit more energy, but your sleepschedule is a lot more delicate than youthink, and you need more consistency tohave reliable sleep over a long period.

Of time. Get some rest, tall child. Getsome rest, tall child. Usually, peoplewho say they only need four hours of sleepjust have a higher tolerance fortiredness. Over time, they will stillfeel the negative impact of lack ofsleep, even if in the morning they'reall perky. The worst is theones who are really bragging about onlyneeding four hours of sleep. You may be allup now, but when you're 35 and you look60, we'll see who's laughing then. Okay,Dennis. I have a couple of friends whodrink before bed because they think ithelps them sleep, which, uh, first offsounds like alcoholism. But alcohol, aswell as THC and melatonin, can helppeople become sleepy, but it totally

messes with your REM cycle, which iswhere your body actually rests andrecovers. I know so many people who takemelatonin every night, and it may seemeffective because you feel sleepy, butyou're not only giving yourself worsesleep; you're also building melatonintolerance and creating reliance onexternal melatonin. It's kind of like ifto feel good, you took drugs every day.You'll take more and more. You'lldevelop a reliance on it. It'll become aA huge problem is that eventually you'llneglect your family in order to feelany validation in his life. Your sonwill try to become a cartoon YouTuber.

Okay, here are some common mistakespeople make that hurt their sleep. A lotof people use their phone, laptop, or TVright before bed. The blue light inthese devices is also found in sunlight,and that wakes you up and suppressesyour natural melatonin. So, doing thisjust before bed makes it a lot harder tofall asleep. Overall, just try not touse your phone or laptop for at least 30minutes before bed unless it's to watchmore of my channel.

Caffeine stays inyour system for a lot longer than youthink. So, for most people, avoidingcaffeine past 3 p.m. is a good rule ofthumb. If you're sensitive, don't drinkit past 12:00 p.m. And for those of youwho say caffeine doesn't affect you, soyou can drink it late in the day, it maynot make you feel sleepy, but if it's inyour system, it will impact your qualityof sleep. So, just try not to drink ittoo late. And don't brag about beingable to handle caffeine either, because thenyou're just as bad as Dennis. ExercisingNot if it's too late in the day. If yourbody is pumped up from lifting orcardio, it's far from ready to sleep.

Some people love late-night workouts,but it can definitely keep you up. So,try avoiding working out at least 2hours before bed. To optimize my sleep,I avoid workingout. Yes. If you're peeing a lot in themiddle of the night every night, tryavoiding liquids after 7:00 p.m.Hydrating is important, so do it earlierin the day. But multiple bathroom tripsduring the night can disrupt your sleepcycle. Or even worse, it can increaseyour chances of wetting the bed. Andeven though you're an adult, everyone at

school is going to find out and make funof you. And as a coping mechanism,you're going to try to become a cartoonYouTuber. Irregular sleep schedules canalso confuse your circadian rhythm. Yourbody loves consistency, so sleeping atthe same time every night contributes tothe best sleep quality. Sleeping latedoes happen to everyone here and there,but the key is to just try to keep asimilar wake-up time in the morning. Ifyou slept late, you'll feel tired forsure, but you'll get sleepier earlier.

That evening can better helpreset your sleep schedule. Speaking ofBetterHelp, that brings us to thesponsor of this video: figuring it outyourself. Licensed therapy is great, butI haven’t received a sponsorship fromBetterHelp yet. So, until they’rewilling to give me some of that sweet,sweet therapy cash, I’m going to bepromoting people just figuring thingsout on their own. You can do it. Youdon’t need to talk to anyone unless thatperson works at BetterHelp and can getme a sponsorship. BetterHelp, my ballsare in your court. All right, so hereare some science-backed tips to helpoptimize your sleep. You want to keepyour bedroom dark, cool, and quiet. Tokeep it dark, I have blackout curtains,but I am really bad at installingthings, so plenty of light still spillsinto my bedroom. So, I also use an eyemask. I know I can just fix the blackoutcurtains, but, okay, you’re not my mom.

Okay, how about you just get off my caseabout this? Your body sleeps best in acool environment around 65° F, 18° C, or291 Kelvin. So, to keep it cool when Isleep, I use a ceiling fan, airconditioning, or if you have some extraWhen I have money to spend, I use this thing calledthe Chili Pad, which is a thin mattresscover that allows you to control thetemperature. It is pretty pricey, but ithas totally revolutionized my sleepquality, and I'd highly recommend it ifyou can afford it. And if Chili Padwants to sponsor me, I am also open tothat. Okay, honestly, if anyone wants togive me money, you can just assume thatI'm open to it. To keep it quiet, it'sobviously nice to live in a place thatisn't too loud outside. I used to livein downtown Manhattan where people yellat each other in the middle of the nightall the time. So, I used siliconearplugs every night, which were reallyhelpful. A white noise machine can alsobe useful. You can use an Alexa orGoogle Home as a white noise machine.

You can buy a dedicated white noisemachine like this, or you can even get awhite noise machine that looks likethis. But, uh, do this at your own risk.For a while, I was sleeping with an eyemask, mouth tape, and earplugs in everynight, which made me look like I wasconstantly in the middle of gettingkidnapped. But that did make me feel abit safer, because if someone broke intoMy apartment and saw me, they'd be like,"Oh, looks like someone's alreadyrobbing the place. I should probably getout of here." You should also try to getsome sunlight in the morning. If you'veever listened to the Huberman podcast,you've probably heard him talk aboutgetting sunlight in your eyes firstthing in the morning because it startsyour circadian rhythm for the day, whichwill lead your body to more accuratelyknow when to fall asleep at night. Thishas really helped my sleep. When I wakeup, after I do my morning routine,

peeing, brushing my teeth, praying formore subscribers, I take a walk outsideand I let the light hit my eyes. Kind offeels like you're in a dramatic indiemovie scene where the main characterreconnects with their hometown and theyrealize they should have never moved tothe big city. All they needed to behappy was right here all along. You'vebeen watching the Hallmark Channel. Somepeople also try supplementation to helpsleep. Like I said before, melatonin hasa host of issues, but taking magnesiumhas helped with my sleep qualitysignificantly. It doesn't make youHelps you with the depth of sleep. Thereare a ton of different types ofmagnesium, but the big ones to help withsleep are threonate, glycinate, andtorate. I take this combination one fromNatural Stacks every night about an hourbefore bed, and then I'm good to go.

Okay, final tip. Here are the thingsthat I do to help me fall asleep. Firstoff, a cool down routine while you'reoff your devices for at least 30 minutesbefore bed is helpful because sleepisn't an on and off switch. It's adimmer. But if you’re still havingtrouble, it could be that you ate late,drank caffeine late, or exercised toolate. Once I'm in bed trying to fallasleep, I've tried counting sheep, whichdoes not work for me. Sheep suck.They're bad. All right, please cut thatout in post. I've tried counting downfrom a thousand, which is not badbecause it focuses your brain onsomething, but once you get into thedouble digits, it just becomes a

countdown to absolute panic. What'sworked for me is the 4-7-8 method, whichis where you breathe in for 4 seconds,you hold your breath for 7 seconds, andthen you breathe out for 8 seconds. ThisReally calms my heart rate, gives mesomething to focus on, and puts me in asuper relaxed state. Not going to lie,sometimes it's difficult to hold mybreath for the full 7 seconds. So, ifyou can't do that, you can inhale fortwo seconds and then exhale for 3seconds. This 2-3 method is what Ido most nights. And if you feel likeyou've been in bed forever and you justcan't sleep, you should get out of bedand do something for 10 to 20 minutes.

Don't turn on any bright lights or go onany devices. But if you meditate, read,or even just listen to calming music,that can help you get out of that mentalloop of thinking about how you can'tsleep. Okay, here's a quick recap ofeverything. You can't really catch up onsleep over the weekend. So, try to haveconsistency in your bedtime. Try to getaround eight hours of sleep, even if youthink you only need four. Alcohol, weed,and melatonin may seem effective, butare actually bad for your sleep. Don'tuse any blue light devices at least 30minutes before bed. Avoid caffeine past3. Don't work out too late in theevening. Avoid drinking a lot of waterLate, try to keep the same wake-up timeso you have an easier time resetting.

All right, this one's important: emailthe people at BetterHelp to sponsor mychannel. You also want to keep yourbedroom dark, cool, and quiet, withwhatever you need: blackout curtains,eye masks, air conditioning, earplugs,and white noise. Get sunlight in themorning. Try magnesium supplementsbefore bed. Use a breathing techniquelike the 478 method or the 23 method tofall asleep. If you can't sleep, justget out of bed for a bit and dosomething without any devices or brightlights. And subscribe to the channel andleave me a compliment to feed mybottomless need for validation. Goodsleep is the most underrated performanceenhancer ever, and optimizing for it canimprove every aspect of your life. Soprioritize it, invest in it, and don'tbe like Dennis.[Music]

#### The three elements of Loop

**Loop components** are portable pieces of content that stay in sync across all the places they are shared. Components allow you to collaborate in the flow of work – on a Loop page or in a chat, email, meeting, or document. They can be lists, tables, notes, and more - you’re always working with the latest information in your preferred app, like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, Whiteboard, and the Loop app.

**Loop pages** are flexible canvases in the Loop app where you can bring together people and all your components, links, tasks, and data. Loop pages can start small and continue to grow to match the size of your ideas. Loop pages can be shared across M365 apps as a link or as an embedded Loop component.

**Loop workspaces** are shared spaces that allow you and your team to see and group everything important to your project, making it easy for you to catch up on what everyone is working on and track progress toward shared goals.

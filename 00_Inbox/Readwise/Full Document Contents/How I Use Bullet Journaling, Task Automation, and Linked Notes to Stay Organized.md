#### Why I Use These Tools—And Not the Others

I’ve tried so many apps, systems, and workflows over the years, hoping to find **the** perfect tool. But the truth is, nothing works across the board. What I’ve landed on isn’t just a collection of apps—it’s the **foundation of my executive function support system**. These tools have proven themselves over time, balancing structure with adaptability, and providing the support I need without overcomplicating things.

This system isn’t about juggling tools—it’s about finding the right ones that integrate well, reduce friction, and actually make life easier.

* **Best For:** Deep reflection, habit tracking, long-term planning.
* **Why It Works:**
	+ Serves as the **focused, pared-down result** of all my notes and ideas.
	+ Acts as a mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity system.

* **Best For:** Task execution, structured priorities, and automation.
* **Why It Works:**
	+ Handles the **heavy lifting** on daily habits, deadlines, and structured to-dos.
	+ Automates tracking and reduces friction—when a task pops up, it triggers Toggl Track.
	+ Keeps me out of the [**decision fatigue**](https://blakehoerres.com/the-quiet-paradox-of-knowing-the-curse-of-competence-and-the-struggle-to-start/) loop of figuring out “what’s next.”

* **Best For:** Linked thinking, knowledge management, structured review cycles.
* **Influences:** Bryan Jenks’ paid template (extensively modified for my needs).
* **Why It Works:**
	+ Uses **Dataview & Templater** to filter, track, and resurface key insights.
	+ Ensures that nothing gets lost—what starts as a thought in the Bullet Journal or Todoist can be **tracked and expanded** here.
	+ Allows me to track habits, progress, and insights **without manually sorting everything.**

* **Best For:** Time-blocking, integrating tasks with real-world schedules.
* **Why It Works:**
	+ Turns Todoist’s structured lists into **actual time commitments**.
	+ Drag-and-drop scheduling gamifies planning, making it **less overwhelming**.
	+ Keeps my calendar from becoming a mess of abandoned tasks.
	+ Allows flexible adjustments, so my day adapts to **real-world energy levels**.

Each tool serves a **clear, defined role** matt raglandin keeping my system functional:

1. **Bullet Journal** → Captures raw thoughts, reflections, and high-level planning.
2. **Todoist** → Translates those thoughts into actionable steps.
3. **Morgen** → Ensures tasks actually fit into my **real** schedule.
4. **Obsidian** → Stores insights, review cycles, and knowledge for long-term tracking.

#### Key Takeaways

* This **isn’t about collecting apps**—it’s about finding what actually works **over time**.
* These tools **support** executive function rather than adding complexity.
* Automation and integration mean less **manual maintenance**.
* A system works best when it reduces **decision fatigue** and friction, rather than adding to it.

Tomorrow, I’ll go deeper into **how tasks actually flow between these tools**, why this setup eliminates wasted effort, and how [**automation & plugins**](https://blakehoerres.com/architecting-productivity-a-modular-approach-to-getting-things-done/) make it seamless.

Let me know—have you found a system that truly supports your workflow, or are you still tweaking?

This is not your Kindle. It belongs toAmazon. And they can delete your books,ban your account, and even shut down theability to download your own purchases.So, I jailbroke mine. It took less than10 minutes. No soldering, no tools, andnow it can do way more than Amazon everintended for this thing. Let me show youhow to actually demazon your Kindle andall the incredible reasons why you wantto do this in the firstplace. All right, so why jailbreak aKindle? What's the point? What does itactually let you do? Now, there’s plentyof reasons to go out and jailbreak yourKindle. Of course, stuff like addingcustom readers, support for EPUB books,custom lock screens, running Linux,and smart home applications, but to me, thebiggest reason is the ability tocompletely disconnect from Amazonservices entirely. That's what I wantyou to remember from leaving this video.It's more about ownership than anythingelse. Right now, here’s the thing. I’mthe techie guy. I can explain to you allthe technical scummy stuff that Amazondoes to keep you locked in and show youtechnical ways to get around it, butI’ll be honest. I’m not too familiarWith this space, or the state of the

ebook scene in general. The big reason Istarted looking into this stuff wasbecause it was really important to mygirlfriend. She loves to read. So, Ifigured I should probably ask a friendwho's way more familiar in the spacethan I am. And I guess that somebodywould be me. Hi, I'm Jared Henderson. Irun a channel that's all about books andphilosophy. I'm a friend of Jeff's. Butmore importantly for this video, I'vebeen a longtime user of Kindles. My dadgot me my first Kindle when I went offto college and I've carried my Kindlewith me basically everywhere I've gonefor probably about a decade now. I'vetaken it on international trips. They'refantastic to just put in your backpackor to have on a plane. I even keep myKindle next to my bed so that I can readbooks before I go to sleep. In a widerange of scenarios, Kindles are justmore convenient than physical books. Andso I really like having one and usingone. But over the last couple of years,I've become more worried about Amazonand about its relationship to the widerbook market. You see, Amazon actuallycontrols about 80% of the ebook market.

So that means that the decisions thatthey make about their devices or abouthow they handle ebooks matter more thanbasically any other marketplace. Andthere have been a couple of stories thatreally got me worried. A couple of yearsago, a woman’s Amazon account wassuspended. And one of the consequencesof having your Amazon account suspendedis that you lose access to all of yourdigital purchases. That means all ofyour ebooks, too. And now, Amazon couldsuspend your account for basically anyreason. And in that woman’s case, theywouldn’t even tell her what she had donewrong. So, she tried to appeal it, butshe didn’t even know how to appeal itbecause again, she didn’t know whatshe was being accused of. Now, let’s saythat my Amazon account got suspended.

What would be the consequence? Well, ifI didn’t have my books backed uplocally, I would lose, I think, about athousand books. Like I said, I use myKindle a lot. I own a lot of thoseebooks, but that’s the thing, right? Idon’t really own them. I’ve justlong-term licensed them from Amazon, andAmazon can take them away from me.

Amazon’s also done a few things whereThey've changed content after I'vebought books. See, a couple of yearsago, Amazon acquired the rights to TheWheel of Time. It's a fantasy seriesthat I really like, and they were goingto turn it into a television show. Aspart of their push, their marketingpush, they updated all of the covers ofthe Wheel of Time ebooks, even forpeople who had already bought them. Thatmeant that my ebook covers got changedto ads essentially that were promos forthis new TV show. Now, look, I wasexcited when that TV show came out,right? Turns out to not be that great,so I stopped watching. But I wasexcited. But that's kind of irrelevant.

I didn't want my book covers beingturned into ads because actually when Ihad bought my Kindle, there had been anoption to pay like $10 more for anad-free device. But then they turned mybook covers essentially into ads, andthat just didn't sit right with me. Ifthey can change book covers, well, theycan actually change anything becausethey control the master copies, right?It's all in the cloud, and your devicewill just update. And then of course,Amazon took away our right to download.

Those files are downloaded directly onto our computers.Arguably, they did this to stop peoplefrom doing what I like to do, which isto store copies locally and even tostrip them of DRM. They probably don'tlike that. They don't like that peopleare doing that with those files. So,they're just quietly removing thoseoptions. In the end, I think it reallycomes down to one issue, and that's thatsomebody is going to own these books.

And if I'm the one paying for them, Iwant that somebody to beme. So yeah, the recent update to theway that we can save our ebooks webought from Amazon was the last strawfor a lot of people. And while backingup my books, I discovered an entireworld of jailbreaking Kindles. And afterseeing what’s possible, I genuinelybelieve that everyone, generally,everyone should be jailbreaking theirKindles if they haven’t already. Anddon’t worry, jailbreaking your Kindle isway safer and easier than you probablythink. My girlfriend isn’t techy at alland she was able to do hers in like 10minutes. It won’t permanently mess upyour Kindle in any way, and it’scompletely reversible in case you don’t.

Like it or want to sell it to afriend. And yes, this is all 100% legal.The reason I'm covering this is becauseeven if you're not a super techexpert, the Kindle that you bought isyours, and you have every right tomaintain ownership of your stuff,regardless if Amazon likes it ornot. So, let’s get a few things out ofthe way. Any Kindle on any firmware fromany year can be jailbroken. Heck, Iliterally bought a brand new unboxed oneand it was jailbroken 20 minutes later.

And no, this doesn’t require opening thedevice or anything. All you need is aUSBC cable and a computer. Now, if yourKindle is over 10 years old, like 2015or something, the process might be alittle different, but for most Kindles,it’s going to be the same process acrossthe board. There’s an awesome writtenguide called the Kindle Modding Wikithat covers this entire process indetail, including the download links forthe files that you might need. I promiseit’s not as scary as you think. First,we’re going to download the jailbreakfrom the wiki guide. It’s calledWinterbreak. Now, it’s going to downloada tar file. You’ve got to double-click it.

And it'll extract everything into afolder. This has all of the files youneed to copy over to your Kindle. Now,by default, some files that need to betransferred over are actually hidden. OnMac, I found out you can do a keyboardshortcut, command, shift, period, andit'll show the hidden files. And don'tworry about these two GitHub folders.That's not important. We just need theactive content folder. All right, let'sset up our Kindle real quick. All we gotto do on this side is just set it intoairplane mode and plug itin. Now, grab all of those files andjust drag them over all the way to yourKindle. All right, now let's restart ourKindle. It's going to take a little

while. Damn, for a brand new device,these things are kind of slow. Allright, once we're back, we're going totry and tap on any of the Kindle storebooks. Doesn't matter which one. It'sgoing to ask you, "Hey, notice thatyou're in airplane mode. Did you want toconnect to Wi-Fi?" And you're going tohit yes. It's going to flash a few timesand then, oh, what's that? Looks likeyour Kindle got infected by a mosquitoor something. And check out this quote,By the way, I bet it has a really sickdouble meaning that I'm not smart enoughto understand. Anyway, it's just goingto do this by itself for a little while.

You don't have to touch anything. Theneventually, you'll see a message sayingit's done. And to install the hotfix,the hotfix just lets the jailbreakpersist on your Kindle. Even if you turnit off and on again, log in and out, yougetit. Now, the hotfix is just a bin file.Don't try and extract this; there's noneed. Just drag it onto your Kindle.

Okay, now we can unplug the cable andexit back out into thehomepage. From there, tap the threedots, go to settings, and then updateyour Kindle. It's going to think there’sa new update, but it's really just a hotfix. Tap update. A three-minute restart later,you're going to see a new book in yourlibrary. Don't worry, as long as youdon't update your Kindle, which youdon't really need to. Uh, you only haveto run this once. Tap on it. Uh, anotherrestart. And that's it. You're done.You're officially jailbroken. Okay,great. But everything still looks thesame. What gives?

There's nothing stopping us from actuallyrunning whatever apps and tools that wewant to install. That's what this wholesetup process was about. But in order todo that, we need to install two reallyimportant things: MRPI, which is yourpackage installer. This is the stuffthat we need to actually install apps,and Kool, which is the Kindle unifiedapplication launcher, which will, you know,actually let us run the apps that weinstalled. One can install thepackages for you, and the other one canrun the packages for you. Does thatmake sense?

Now this is kind of where the process for different Kindles kind of diverge.So I won't go into specifics. Definitely check out the wikiso you know what to pick. But it'sbasically the same thing: plug in theKindle, drag and drop some files, dosome weird ritual on the Kindle thatwould make zero sense outside of thiscontext. And now you have Kool on yourKindle.

Now, when you first open it,there's not going to be anything inthere, but when we install somepackages, we can open them here. So,what do we install now that your Kindleis jailbroken?

Literally, the first thing you're goingto want to install is Co-Reader. Itbasically replaces your Kindle's stockinterface and adds a bunch of newfeatures that Amazon just refuses togive you. And the biggest feature, in myopinion, is the ability to just drag anddrop ePUBs and PDFs onto your Kindle,which are the most popular types of bookformat files. Now, you're probablyasking, "But Jeff, wait, doesn't Amazonalready have a tool for this?" You know,the Send to Kindle app. Not really,actually. The Kindle straight updoesn't support EPUB and PDF files. So,what the Send to Kindle app does is takeyour EPUB, convert it into their

proprietary encrypted format, and thensend that over to your Kindle. You can'tjust drag a book onto it and startreading. Not without Amazon's help, atleast. But it can read them with thehelp of an app like Co-Reader. So, whydoesn't Amazon support files like EPUBsand PDFs? Money. It's money. I reallywish there was some super deeptechnical reason for this, but no, thisis purely a business decision. See, forAmazon, the Kindle is about selling youbooks through their store. It's not anE-readers are storefronts; they don’tcare about selling you a good e-reader.

They care about selling you books. Andon top of that, they’ve already droppedsupport for the Send Kindle app fordevices older than 2013, which means ifyou’re relying on Amazon’s cloud serviceto send over your books, they’ve proventhat one day they’re just going to turnit off. Now, co-reader, on the otherhand, can read a lot of different fileformats, and importing books is muchsimpler. Oh, nice. It’s literally just afile browser. Oh, cool, cool, cool,cool. So, you can literally just plug inyourcomputer, make a folder called books,drag in all your EPUBs, and there’s mybooks folder. Oh, nice. It comes up withthe cover art, too. That is really nice.

It’s grabbed all the cover for all mybooks. Oh, except this one. Wonder whathappenedthere. I think this is a good mix ofeverything. That’s really cool. Once youopen a book, that’s where co-readerreally starts showing off what it cando. Compared to the stock reader thatships with the Kindle, this one givesyou so much more control over.

Everything. You can do stuff like twocolumn mode for every book on anydevice, which Amazon restricts to onlytheir more expensive models. You canpick between page view and continuousscrolling, which is kind of neat. Oh,and you're going to love this. Okay, youknow the little stock Kindle wallpapersor those boring promo ads they put whenyou put your Kindle to sleep? Check itout. Yeah, co-reader lets you installcustom screen savers so you can reallymake your Kindle completely unique. Youcan have it so when you lock it, itshows the cover of the book that you'rereading. Kind of like a real book now

that I think about it. You can have itshow the progress of the book thatyou're reading or just general readingmetrics for the week. The lady doesn'tlike this one. She tells me,"Apparently, some people don't likeknowing how much time they spentreading, or you can just have it cyclethrough whatever pictures you want." Iput some of these gibbly ones for mygirlfriend. Oh, the girlies are going togo crazy for this. I just know it. Iended up making some of my own. I knowmy girlfriend really likes the artwork.

From Yoshi Toonara. So, I tossed one ofhis museum pieces into Photoshop. Iposterized it, turned it black andwhite, and check it out. The lady lovedit, and it really makes your Kindle feeljust that much more unique. It’s justanother way to de-Amazon your Kindle.

Oh, and for those who like usingCalibre, you’re going to love thisbuilt-in wireless syncing with Calibre.If you have a giant library already setup or you’re constantly adding to yourcollection, you can just grab the booksyou want from your Calibre library andsend it over to your Kindlewirelessly. It’s like Amazon’s Send toKindle app, but without Amazon breathingdown your neck. They can’t take thisaway from you. And there’s a bunch ofdifferent plugins for Calibre that canadd to your experience. I didn’t havetime to check out a lot of them, but twothat did stand out to me were Ask GBT,which just prompts the Chat GPT searchbar mid-reading, which I’m sure isreally helpful in some situations. Andanother one called Rakuyomi. And itbasically acts as a search enginespecifically for manga. It can searchsources and find and download chapters.

Straight from your Kindle. I'm actuallynot too familiar with manga, so Ithere's like duplicates of these. I'mjust going to pick whatever. But like,yeah, it's really simple. Yeah. Oneshot. It's really simple. I don't thinkthere's a difference between thedifferent versions. I think they allkind of do the samething. Oh, what's this? There is a bigdifference between the differentversions. Definitely do your research onthat. And there is so much more that Ican't cover here. There's stuff likeplugins, news feeds, OCR. Seriously,Correer not only gives you the freedom

to transfer whatever books and formatsthat you want, it completely transformsthe way you experience them on yourKindle, too. You can genuinely stop hereand already be getting the most out ofyour jailbreak. Oh, and I know some ofyou are probably wondering if you couldstill rip your purchased Kindle bookseven after Amazon kind of patched theold method. And the answer is yes, usingCalibri, too. But I couldn't get thatsection done in time for this video. Andhonestly, I've noticed that tutorialsections tend to tank my viewer.

Retention in videos. So instead, I'mgoing to be putting a full walkthroughon how to do this on my Patreon. Don'tworry, I'm making this completely free.You don't have to pay or anything towatch it. It's just there for people whocare enough to seek it, and it's in asafer spot in case Amazon tries tostrike my channel for showing you this.The link is going to be in the descriptionin case you weren't able to back up yourbooks in time. So, Co-Reader really isthe big app, but what else can youinstall? So, believe it or not, there'sa surprising amount of homebrew gamesthat have been made for the Kindles.

Now, don't expect Cyberpunk running onthis thing, but there's still quite abit here that's kind of impressive. Alot of these games are launched usingsomething called KTerm, which isbasically a terminal emulator for yourKindle. Apparently, this is also whatAmazon uses internally to debug theKindle. So, for example, somebody did astraight-up port of Tetris. Cool. Use thekeyboard to navigate through all ofthis. And you know, other than the god-awful frame rate, it's surprisinglyintuitive.

This footage now, I just realized theweird characters on the left sideactually spell out "Tetris." Yeah, it wasI actually couldn't pick that up when Iwas playing. This is fun. Jesus. And ofcourse, we can't forget about "MindSweeper." A really competent version,honestly. Oh, come on. Oh, hell yeah.How does this not crash the Kindle?Jesus. This game also came bundled witha bunch of other puzzle games that I'mtoo dumb to play, but there are a lot ofthem here. But this is as far as I got.Like you, I was also wondering where the classics were. It was like,you know, Sudoku, crossword, snake game,and I kept running into the same wall. Iwould download the necessary files andthen it just wouldn't work. Then someonewould be like, "Oh no, you're actuallysupposed to download this file. It runsway smoother." Still doesn't work. Uh,so I would go back to the forum to see if

I missed anything and oh my god, thisproject is 12 years old. Yeah. So, a lotof these projects are really old and areno longer being maintained. It's areally big problem. It's not likethere's no documentation for the Kindle.It's just that most of it is over aIt's a decade old. But I kept looking and Imanaged to find something that I thinkis really, really cool. This is Gambitand it's a Game Boy emulator for theKindle. Two frames a page. If you eversaw the 144p screen of the original GameBoy and thought, "Man, I wish there wasa way to make this run worse." Well,here you go. Okay, because I think mymicrowave has more power than this thingdoes. Um, I've downloaded a few games,but I was told that I'm not expected tohave many of them work.

Oh my God. Let me get that speed onhigh. I'm going to needthat. Oh. Oh, that's not good. That'snot what I meant. That's not what Imeant. The screen doesn'trefresh fast enough to be able to seewhat the colorsare. Oh, that's hard to look at. Can yousee what those colors are? Because I can'ttell which direction is facing what.

Okay, let's try something else. Oh,dude. It has quick save. No way, dude.Oh, man. The refresh rate is just killeron this thing. It's destroying it. Yeah,this is rough, dude. Actually,wait a minute. This might not beterrible because I'm just like pressing A.

No, it’s still pretty bad. Yeah, Idon’t, oh my god. Oh, that’s unplayable.I cannot play like this. There’s no way.I got to get into a fight. I got to get at least one fight.I wouldn’t expect you to actually finish a whole game like this.It’s not going to happen. Yeah.You know what? Squirtle’s fine. We’ll take Squirtle.Where are my Squirters at?Wait, no, actually, so slow. You know, II’m so sad because I feel like if itwasn’t for the weird refresh rate, thiswould be pretty playable. It doesn’t seem like a processing power thing.My poor Squirtle is like melting overthere. Look at him. Now, this one only works on older Kindles.The app needs to be recompiled to actually get this running on newer Kindles.Still, it’s really impressive that this is running on what’s essentially a smartwatch display.If you want to check these out, a lot of these can be downloaded from the Kindle modding Discord.I’ll leave a link in the description. Tell Jeff said hi.So, let’s talk about scripts, which are cool bits of code created bythe community that can tweak your Kindle even more. There are two ways to runScripts can be entered either by typing them into theKTM app, but that takes a while. So,what most people do is use aprogram called USB Net Light, which letsyou SSH into your Kindle, so you cantype and send and receive stuff through

a computer instead of typing on that2FPS keyboard. Once you're sshed in, youcan start loading up some really coolscripts. For example, I had to pay 20bucks to remove those stupid ads on mygirlfriend's Kindle. Uh, since she gotthe ad-supported version, even thoughthat was like six years ago now, and youcan't use the custom screen savers untilyou get rid of the special offers,either by paying or by having a modelthat doesn't come with them. Actually,there is a way to get rid of theseads, but it seems like no Kindle devwants to touch that for fear ofaccidentally pissing off Amazon. Well,anyway, I don't care. So, here's ascript. Uh, you run it, and it gets rid ofall your ads. You don't have to pay 20bucks. Uh, go have fun. There's thisscript that'll connect to a URL of yourchoice and then full screen the page tomake it look like a native app. Andthere's a lot of possibilities for this.

Like a synced-up to-do list on Notion. Alot of people like to set this up totheir home assistant so it can display abunch of really nice, glanceable dashboardscreens. I think this is really greatfor a lot of older Kindles that are kindof just sitting around in drawers andfinding new ways to repurpose them. Theonly thing is I couldn’t find any wall mountsfor the more recent paper Kindledesigns. Yeah, as it turns out, there’snot a lot of people modding these to runHome Assistant on them. So, with thehelp of my buddy JP, we came up with areally quick, easy wall mount withscrews and a charging hole, so we canstill plug it in when necessary. Then, Iwas able to send it off to PCB Way, andin a few days, they got me my design. Itwas really, really neat. It’s like areally good quality stuff here. Jesus.

Yeah, a lot of people ask me what theyshould do if they don’t have a 3Dprinter, but they still want to print outa proper model design, and PCBWay is perfect for that type of stuff.They also sponsored this video, so bigthanks to them for that. They have alltypes of different materials you canthink of too, from basic PLA for what IUse this model for all the way upto stainless steel. Whatever you candesign, they can make it. And you'lleven have a specific agent assigned toyou, so they can look over your design,make sure that it'll properly print,make sure that it's all good, and makesure that there's no issues with yourmodel before sending it out to you.

Yeah, a lot of people don't know thatyou can get 3D prints done through PCBway. If you want to try foryourself, you can use my code, "damnit10," for $10 off your first order. Tryit out. Let me know what you think. Andbig thanks to them for sponsoring thisvideo. The only reason that there's not moreof these scriptlets is because there's nodocumentation on how to actually makethem. But as I was writing this video,the main jailbreak dev finally pusheddocumentation on how to make these. Sogo have at it. I'll put a link to theirDiscord in the description, so you can gocheck out all the other scriptlets that

other people have made. So let's talkabout running Linux. Believe itor not, it's possible to just straightup run a full version of Linux on yourKindle. And it's surprisingly easy toSet up. There's a great guide on GitHubon how to get this running, buthonestly, it's a little outdated. So,basically what you do is you downloadthis, drag this entire folder into yourextensions folder on your Kindle, thentap this to download the latest versionof Alpine Linux. Give it a few minutesto install everything, run a quickreboot, and just launch Alpine desktop.

It's literally that easy. The best partof this is it doesn't entirely wipe awayyour stock Kindle OS. You could stilluse this like any other cool app. Andonce you're done with it, you can justrestart your Kindle and you're back toyour Kindle OS. So, there's like zerocompromises.

Catching the orientationrotation. Aha. Yeah, dude. This is justlike a straight-up desktop. Like it hasstuff. It has a CD-ROM. Can I plugin a flash drive, do you think? Hold on.I want to test that. Okay, no flashdrive, but I have an SSD that I think I could probably usefor this. Let's give that a shot.Oh, wait. It's on this side. Whoops.Okay, Darren. Yeah, it seems like itdoesn't really want to work. Can IChromium? Oh, dude. Is it just straightup Google Chrome? So, my big problemright now is Chromium's keyboard justdoesn't work at all. Look, I log backout. It has the keyboard, but I can'tfind it. Alpine, it clearly has akeyboard. It just won't let me use it inChrome. I got it. I got it. It's alittle square down here. Look, a littlesquare. Bam. There's the keyboard. Allright. There I am. Look.

Oh, dude. Hell yeah. You know, thisis actually running somehow better than thebuilt-in browser. Let's do my newestvideo. Oh, man. Ads, bro. Oh, God. Wait,this is my video. I make a living off ofthis. Oh my God. This is just everythinggets so much funnier when you runit through like a digital Kindledisplay. Oh, look. It's Jeff. It's twobit Jeff. Yeah. Why should I be the onlyone that's being made fun of? Holdon. Oh, yeah. Now we're cooking. This iswhat I see when I'm in sleep paralysis.Uh, I have an idea. What if I did? Oh,dude. Oh, we're so back. Hold on. Let mefull screenthis. Oh, hell yeah. Oh, we're so back.Let's play this. Oh, we'rein.

Frames per second sometimes. Oh man, this isbad. I forgot the Kindle doesn’t havemulti-touch. So, it’s really got to pickand choose when we shoot name here. Andon top of that, I can’t even seeanything. Okay, but look, it runs. I canshoot among other things. Yeah, seethat? Look at that. What button wasthat? Okay, well, you get the idea. Aheads up though, you do need to have aminimum of 2 gigs to run this, whichmight be an issue on older Kindles sincethose ship with like 8 gigs max. I’m nottoo creative enough to figure out whatto do with this, but I would love tohear what kind of cool stuff this wouldbe useful for. This basically turns yourKindle into a super lightweightcomputer, and no one talks about it forsome reason. So, this is as far as I wasable to dig up on the Kindle. I hopeyou’re starting to see like what’sreally possible with this thing. Like,you can really just strip out everythingAmazon related and make it completelyyours. The longer we wait, the longerAmazon’s going to try to chip away atthe things that we own. And while sure,it would be nice to be able to just telleveryone to go and buy a Kobo so youYou don't have to deal with all this; a lot

of people already own Kindles. I feellike it's better to educate them onAmazon's reach and give them theknowledge to get around it. You know,give them a choice at least. Andhonestly, I think the crazy thing isthat I would have never looked into thisscene if it wasn't for my girlfriendbringing it up to me that she wasconcerned about what would happen to herebooks. Uh, I didn't really get the bigdeal. I mean, they're ebooks. Who cares,right? But I asked her more about it,about the community, you know, about hercollection. We have books all around thehouse, and those are all hers. Uh, shereally, really loves to read. I felt badI never stopped and asked her aboutthese books because the way that shetalked about these books was generally sospecial, like she was justso excited. Each book had a story on howit ended up on her shelves. Some of themwere autographed or shipped from adifferent country. Some she rememberswaiting in line to pick up from apre-order. I bought it because it wasbanned in like a million schools. So Iwas like, "Why?" I don't want to talk aboutThe movie. You don't like the movie?

It's not going so well, castingwise, but I'll still watch it. Like,this was clearly really special for her.And then it clicked for me. Thisenthusiasm and this cling to holding onto physical copies of the stories thatshe loves. I've seen this before; it'sjust a little different. Now, in termsof digital copies, I'm familiar withexactly what this looks like. You buysomething for full price because youwant to do the right thing, support thepeople who make your media. You realizethe company ultimately still controlswhat they can do with it, making decisions

about your purchase without everconsidering your input, and sometimeseven leaving me with nothing. And thisis the same thing. And even if itdoesn't affect me, it still affects thepeople that we care about. So her Kindleis running Co-Reader now and a bunch ofother stuff and she never has to worryabout that stuff again. And who knows,maybe there's someone in your life thatyou'd want to do this for. I don't know.Okay, that's all I got. Click over hereto check out another video, and thank youfor watching.

##### Announcements

* AKS Kubernetes version `1.31` standard support will be deprecated by November 1, 2025. Kindly upgrade your clusters to 1.32 community version or enable [Long Term Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/long-term-support) with 1.31 in order to continue in the same version. Refer to [version support policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-cli#kubernetes-version-support-policy) and [upgrading a cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster?tabs=azure-cli) for more information.
	+ The [`InPlaceOrRecreate` feature gate](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/16/kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-beta/) for [Vertical Pod Autoscaling](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/vertical-pod-autoscaler) 1.4.2 will be enabled with AKS Kubernetes version `1.34`, allowing customers to use the `InPlaceOrRecreate` update mode in their VPA objects.
	+ The [Vertical Pod Autoscaling](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/vertical-pod-autoscaler) component `vpa-recommender` and `vpa-updater` will be highly available with AKS Kubernetes version `1.34`. They will have 2 replicas by default.
* Revision asm-1-24 of the Istio add-on has been deprecated. Please migrate to a supported revision following the [Istio add-on upgrade guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/istio-upgrade).
* AKS Kubernetes version `1.34` is now available in preview. Refer to [1.34 Release Notes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/08/27/kubernetes-v1-34-release/) and [upgrading a cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster) for more information.
* Starting on 30 November 2025, AKS will no longer support or provide security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster?tabs=azure-cli) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).
* Security patch information for Ubuntu 24.04 is available in [AKS-Release-Tracker](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).
* Azure Kubernetes Service no longer supports the `--skip-gpu-driver-install` node pool tag to skip automatic driver installation. This node pool tag can no longer be used at AKS node pool creation time to install custom GPU drivers or use the GPU Operator. Alternatively, you should use the generally available `gpu-driver` API field to update your existing node pools or create new GPU-enabled node pools to [skip automatic GPU driver installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/gpu-cluster?tabs=add-ubuntu-gpu-node-pool#skip-gpu-driver-installation).
* AKS Automatic is generally available. Find the recording to the virtual launch event on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/live/1usnu6dS51M?si=iYw6xSFSI6qNZ0Rk).
* Availability Sets on AKS are being retired on AKS on September 30 2025. Any new attempts to create a new Availability Sets will be blocked as of September 30 2025. Existing Availability Sets will remain functional after retirement but will be considered out of support. To migrate from Availability Sets, see the [Availability Sets migration documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/availability-sets-on-aks) for more info.
* The Basic Load Balancer is being retired on AKS on September 30 2025. Any new attempts to create a new basic tier load balancer will be blocked. Existing Basic load balancers will remain functional after retirement but will be considered out of support. See the [basic load balancer migration documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-basic-load-balancer-on-aks) for more details on migration to the Standard load balancer.

##### Release notes

###### Features

* [API Server Vnet Integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/api-server-vnet-integration) is now available in East US region.
* AKS Node Problem Detector (NPD) conducts [GPU health monitoring](https://aka.ms/aks/gpu-health-monitoring) to enable automatic detection and reporting of issues impacting select GPU-enabled VM sizes, and is now generally available.
* [Kubelet Serving Certificate Rotation (KSCR)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/certificate-rotation#kubelet-serving-certificate-rotation) is now enabled by default in Sovereign cloud regions. Existing node pools in these regions will have KSCR enabled by default when they perform their first upgrade to any kubernetes version 1.27 or greater. Kubelet serving certificate rotation allows AKS to utilize kubelet server TLS bootstrapping for both bootstrapping and rotating serving certificates signed by the Cluster CA. See [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/certificate-rotation#kubelet-serving-certificate-rotation) for detailed instructions.
* Node auto provisioning (NAP) now supports private clusters, and disk encryption sets. See [NAP documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/node-autoprovision) for more information.

###### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where [KAITO](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/aks-extension-kaito) workspace creation would fail on [AKS Automatic](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-aks-automatic) because gpu-provisioner creates an agentPool. Non-node auto provisioning pools, such as agentPool, are now allowed to be added to AKS Automatic clusters.
* Fixed a bug where [ETag](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-etags) was not returned in ManagedClusters or AgentPools responses in API versions 2024-09-01 or newer, even though the API specification said it would be.

###### Behavioral Changes

* [Deployment Safeguards](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/deployment-safeguards) will stop enforcing readiness and liveness probes on the placeholder pods that [Application Routing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/app-routing) creates to mount synchronized secrets from Azure Key Vault.
* [AKS Automatic](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-aks-automatic) system pool needs to have at least 3 availability zones, ephemeral OS disk, and Azure Linux OS.
* Starting with [20250902-preview API](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/containerservice/resource-manager/Microsoft.ContainerService/aks/preview), the `enableCustomCATrust` field is removed. This field is not required when using the GA feature, and is only used by a deprecated version of the feature. When using Custom Certificate Authority, you no longer need to specify `enableCustomCATrust`. You can just add certificates to your cluster by specifying your text file for the `--custom-ca-trust-certificates` parameter. See [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/custom-certificate-authority) for detailed instructions.
* Starting September 2025, new AKS clusters that use the AKS-managed virtual network option will place cluster subnets into private subnets by default (defaultOutboundAccess = false) in alignment with [egress best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/default-outbound-access#why-is-disabling-default-outbound-access-recommended). This setting does not impact AKS-managed cluster traffic, which uses explicitly configured outbound paths. It may affect unsupported scenarios, such as deploying other resources (e.g., VMs) into the same subnet. Clusters using BYO VNets are unaffected by this change. In supported configurations, no action is required.
* For [Pod Sandboxing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-pod-sandboxing), `kata-mshv-vm-isolation` will be replaced with `kata-vm-isolation` while the `--workload-runtime` used when creating a cluster will be changed from `KataMshvVmIsolation` to `KataVmIsolation`. Make sure you use the correct name when creating Pod Sandboxing clusters.
* Cluster Autoscaler will delete nodes that encounter provisioning errors/ failures immediately, instead of waiting for the full max-node-provision-time defined in the [cluster autoscaler profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/cluster-autoscaler?tabs=azure-cli#use-the-cluster-autoscaler-profile). This change significantly reduces scale-up delays caused by failed node provisioning attempts.
* In ingress-nginx managed via the application routing add-on, the metric `ingress_upstream_latency_seconds` has been [removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/controller-v1.12.0) following its deprecation upstream.

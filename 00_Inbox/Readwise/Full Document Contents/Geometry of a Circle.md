- Summary: A circle has parts like radius, diameter, chord, sector, and arc. The circumference is the distance around the circle and can be found using formulas with radius or diameter. The area inside a circle is calculated with the formula π times the radius squared.

###### Definition

The distance around the boundary of a circle is called the *circumference*.

![](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/images/Circumference.png)
The distance across a circle through the centre is called the *diameter*.

The distance from the centre of a circle to any point on the boundary is called the *radius*. The radius is half of the diameter; 2r=d.

The line segment that joins two points on the circle is a *chord*. Every diameter is a chord, but not every chord is a diameter.

The area that a chord cuts off is called a *segment*.

The area inside a circle and bounded by two radii is a *sector*.

The length between two points around the circumference of a circle is an *arc*.

###### Circumference

The formula for calculating the circumference is C=πdor C=2πr where d is the diameter and r is the radius.

###### Worked Examples

Example 1

The radius of a given circle is r=4cm. Calculate the circumference.

Find the diameter of a circle with circumference 18cm.

C=πd18=πd Divide both sides by π: =dd=d≈5.7cm (to 1 decimal place)

The area of a circle with radius r is Area =πr2

###### Worked Examples

The radius of a given circle is 2.5cm. Find the area of the circle.

The area of a circle is 50cm². Find the radius.

Area =πr250=π×r2 Divide both sides by π. r2=r=√r≈4.0cm (to 1 decimal place)

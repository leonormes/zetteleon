Imagine being able to pick up any book,read it, and remember almost everything from it.This kind of superpower memory recall might feellike fiction, but there are people in the real worldwho seem to carry an incredible abilityto hold on to informationand I’m definitely not one of them.I’ve read hundreds of books, blogs, and newsletters,but my ability to recall any of it is terrible.So I decided to finally look into this blind spot,to learn about how the smartest peoplein the world remember informationand to uncover their systems so I can use them for myself.This video is brought to you by Squarespace,I’ll talk more about them later in the video.

If I were to show you a non-fiction bookthat you’ve read over the past year,whether it was for school, work,or your own personal development,how likely are you to be ableto remember five facts from the book?How well could you explain the book to someone else?All right, let me give this a try for myself.

"Steal Like An Artist" is about being creative,which means getting inspired by other people,and you should steal like an artist.(lip trills)I just read this book, so this one’s a little bit unfair.What else was it?What else was in this book?

Great ideas are really simple and clear.I think that's all I got.I can't even remember one of the 48 laws.I just read this book like a month ago.There's not much of a point in reading non-fiction books,particularly books about personal developmentif you're not actually going to absorband implement the insights,but remembering everything might be a bit of a stretchfor the average person.After some research, I discovered that our abilityto remember things varies wildly from person to person.

Some have terrible memories, others exceptional,and even others have photographic memories.As you might have guessed, the average memory ismessy and often unreliable.It's easier for us to remember events that providea deviation from our typical sensory experience.Like getting hit in the face with a ball,that interesting thing you learned from that self-help book,not so much, but my question is can we change that?I knew exactly who I needed to speak with.I read online that you've readover 3,000 books—is that true?- I don't know, I think it's probably bad form to count,you know, like with the romantic partners.- I don't know about you, but that number,well, it wouldn't take me very long to add up.Ryan Holiday is the international bestselling authorof great books like "The Obstacle Is the Way."And "Ego Is the Enemy," and while I can't remember muchof what I read in these books,I do remember them being really good.

Ryan, thanks so muchfor being here. - Of course.- [Matt] One of the things that I was struck bywhen I first interviewed Ryan back in 2019,was his memory recall.He pulled quotes and stories effortlesslyfrom the books that he's read over the years.- Eisenhower, he had this line, he said,"William James talked about this.I have a quote in the intro from Blaise Pascal.Buddha, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Confucius and-"- I seriously needed to know his secret.So I jumped on a video call with him so we could getto the bottom of it.

One of the main reasons why I wanted to chat with you isbecause I have this problem where I read a non-fiction bookand then I completely forget about everything.Like I can look at that book and be like,"I don't remember one or two things from this book."How can we get better at remembering what we readand putting into practice what we read?- First off, I'd be a little kinder to yourself.Having one or two things that you take from a book,if those are important things that could change your life,you know, you paid $11 for this book; is it so badthat you only got two life-changing things from it, right?So like I think sometimes people are like,"I don't have perfect recall of the book,"I mean, the book was supposed to take you on a journeyand leave you with something.

I started in publishing as a research assistant.I worked for this amazing author named Robert Greeneand he showed me a way of readingthat I practice to this day that I think could be valuable,which is basically, as I read a book,I fold pages as I'm reading and then I make notes to myself.I'm highlighting the things that I'm likingand then what I do as a writer, because I want to use a lotof this information is I then transfer the stuffthat I really liked or that really impacted meand I put them on note cards and so I just write the thoughtthat I had that it inspired or I write down the storyand then I sort those note cards by theme.So I'm kind of creating like an exterior brainthat organizes the stuff that I took from the books.

- So I decided to put Ryan's system to the testand try it out for myself, and what better book to start withthan "Courage Is Calling,"that's Ryan's latest book, by the way.All right, so I've got my tools here: highlighter, pen,my post-it bookmarks here, and a stack of note cardsand, of course, my book. Let's see how this works.

So when you really break down Ryan's system,there are three main parts.First, take notes while you read,second, revisit and revise your noteswhen you're finished with the book.

And third, categorize and file your notes.The reason why this kind of system is so effectiveat helping us retain more of what we read comes downto how our brains process information.Over time, we’ve developed a sorting processto help us determine what information to hold ontoin our explicit memory.That’s the type of long-term memory that’s concernedwith the recollection of facts and events.Thanks to what’s known as heuristic memory processing,we tend to prioritize information that is frequently used,recently used, or likely to be needed to make decisions.So becoming a better learner is all about putting inthe work: reading, taking notes, studying,and making use of the information that you’re taking in.In other words, having a system like Ryan’s— and while Ryan said that he enjoys audiobooks and eBooks,he thinks that there’s an advantage to going analog.

I do tend to find that people who are like,“Oh, I listen to a lot of audiobooks or I listen to—I read a lot of eBooks,” the recall’s not there.They’re like, “I do my highlights,but they just go somewhere on my computer.”I think there is something about getting awayfrom the screen, sitting down, and engaging deeplywith the world in front of you.(gentle music) (mug thuds)All right, so I have completely finished reading“Courage Is Calling” and I have takenextensive notes throughout.

So I am a slow reader, and this process of takingthorough notes throughout the entire bookdefinitely slows me down even more, probably by 30 or 40%.But the idea is that hopefullythis will make these memories and ideas justa little bit more sticky.

Now, I need to go through this entire bookand take all of my notes,all of the best notes that I’ve taken and put themdown onto these note cards.

So this video is sponsored by my friendsover at Squarespace.I’ve been using Squarespace for nearly a decadefor one main reason: theymake it insanely easy for meto bring my ideas to life. Let me show you what I mean.

Let’s say that you’ve got an idea for a websitewhere you teach people how to improve their memory.You start off by going to squarespace.comto grab your new domain name,mattrememberseverything.com.

So now that I've gotten two-thirds of the wayinto this note-taking experiment, it's become clearthat this is a very slow and methodical process.If you're anything like me,this can make you feel a bit antsy,but what I continue to remind myself is that this isn'tabout becoming superhuman and devouring books in a day.It's about taking the time to digest the information,think critically about it, and to try to find ways to reuseand repurpose what I'm learning and really more importantlyto actually enjoy the process.

Reading is a pleasurable activity; I enjoy doing it,and so you would never hear someone be like,"Dude, I have the fastest sex,you would not believe it," right?Or like, "You should see how fast I can scarf down foodat this fancy restaurant."I'm having a conversation with Ernest Hemingway,or Marcus Aurelius, or Doris Kearns Goodwin;these are like the best people in the world at what they do.

I want to enjoy that like I'm going to take my time doing it.So I have finished taking the best ideas, notes, stories,and quotes from this book and put them down ontoabout 20 to 30 note cards, and now is the pointin the process where I need to go throughand organize all this.

One thing that I've realized from this process isthat you don't remember things by accident,which means I need to systematize and organizeall of these notes into different buckets, categories,and themes. It's probably too early to tellwhether this system will improve my memory in the long run.

I have a feeling I'm still going to be on the goldfish end of the memory scale,but I've learned something even more importantover the past few weeks of following this system.You actually can't remember everything you want to;you just need to store it outside of your brain.

Oh, and if you're wondering whether I'll keep this up myself, maybe,but I don't know if it'll look exactly like this.I don't know how many boxes of note cards I can haveat my place and still keep my sanity.

How many boxes of note cards do you have?Well, at least one for every single bookthat I've written, but I'm looking. I have one, two, three,four, five, six, I have seven in my office right now.

My system is an amalgamation combination of Rob Greene'sand yours can be your own spin on mine.

[Matt] Whether you decide to follow an analog systemlike Ryan's or go digital,the important thing is to just get started.You're better off starting imperfectlythan being paralyzed by the hopeor the delusion of perfection.My system has evolved over the years;it will continue to evolve.Maybe there's some version in the futurewhere it does become digital,but right now, this is what works for meand the main thing is that I'm doing it alwaysand I'm getting better as I go.

Thanks so much for watching this video;if you liked it, don't forget to hit Subscribeand especially that little Notification Bellso you get future videos from me.That way, you don't have to work too hard to rememberto watch my videos later.By the way, my exploration into memoryand learning is only just beginning.Stay tuned in a couple of weeks for a new videoabout how to build a second brainby taking all the information we consumeand putting it into an intelligent digital system.It's the complete ecosystem of appsthat you use to manage information.

[Matt] Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you next time.

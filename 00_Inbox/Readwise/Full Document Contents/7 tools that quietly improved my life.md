## Full Document
After testing over six figures worth of analog tools and tech products to improve my life,there are only a few that have stuck around and that I actually continue to use. In this videoI'm going to share seven of them. These tools have completely transformed the way that I workand operate. In many cases, it's reduced my clutter by up to 90%, and others have been smallquality of life improvements that have really gone a long way. The most expensive item on this listis $150, but the cheapest one is actually only $3. So, if you're thinking of buying any ofthese things, make sure to watch until the end of the video.

The first tool helped me eliminate the chaos of constantly checking my calendar and having multiple apps manage that. As far as thecalendar goes, whenever I've tried out different apps and widgets, they tend to just cause more distraction,but this device solved it in a super elegant way and it's this e-ink display.

So, this e-ink display is called TRMNL and it's created by this entrepreneur called Ryan Kulp, whomI actually met before and he's super talented. It's basically just an e-ink display that you canuse to display anything that you want and it's completely open source and there are a lotof plugins for it. I've been using this for a few months now and it's one of those devicesthat really just makes a lot of sense. There's no touchscreen, so there's nothing to fiddle with,there are no buttons really on this device at all; you set it up once and then it refreshes a coupleof times a day with whatever information that you want. For me, I just have my calendar, which

I think is really nice and I just have this at my desk. But you can also have other things,like, for example, if you sell stuff on Shopify, you can display your analytics or your YouTubeanalytics and even your sleep score from Eight Sleep. The main benefit of having my calendarlike this is that I don't need to constantly have my calendar open to see what I have goingon next. I just have this at my desk, and I can quickly glance and see what I have coming up forthe next hour or the next week.

Another benefit of this is that my girlfriend can just look at my calendar, because it's just on my desk, and seewhen I'm free and when I'm busy. There's zero subscription fee and there's absolutely nothingto mess with once you actually set it up. I think the form factor and build quality is super nice; I have this clear case one, which I thinklooks super sick and they just came out with a few different colors. This product has been sonaturally ingrained in my workspace that I even forgot to mention it or make a video about it inthe past few months. After I set this up, it has really transformed the way that I work in that Ican always see my calendar and follow it without having to fiddle with any more technology.

This tool fixed my calendar, but the next tool fixed another problem in my life, which was knowing where my money was going, and it's this app, Copilot.This tool has single-handedly saved me thousands of dollars by knowing where my money is going and also increasing my income.In college, for a while, I used a manual spreadsheet where I tracked every single expense that I had and every single piece of income that I had,which, although kind of worked, was super clunkyand it took a long time to actually maintain that and set that up, so eventually I stopped doing it.I've also tried out other budgeting and finance apps created by big banks like Mint and other ones like that, but they were all kind of antiquated and not that easy to use.It wasn't until about a year ago that I was recommended this app because of how easy to use and how beautiful the design was.

So, this is Copilot, and what it is, is that it's an all-in-one finance and budgeting app.I mentioned this app in my "What's on my iPhone mini and iPad" video before, so I actually got in contact with the company, and they agreed to sponsor this video.I was able to get you guys an exclusive promotion for this channel, which is a two-month free trial, so you can try it out and see if you can actually save more money or make enough money to pay for the app after two months.

So, in terms of how the app works, you basically just log into your banking platforms and investment platforms, and then it aggregates all that information and tells you what your assets are, what your income is, and what your expenses are.The pages that have been super helpful for me is one: tracking my recurring subscriptions.So, I found a lot of subscriptions that I forgot I was still paying for, and some they even charged me for even though I canceled it,and so, I was able to find that and cancel that through using Copilot.

With investing, I also think that they have a better UI than most investing platforms, which are kind of old and antiquated.They've made it so that you can really easily see your cost bases, which is really nice, and you can also compare your performance with the market.So, if you're not outperforming the market, you can just invest in the market.They just announced a new major feature, which is a savings goal.So, you can set an amount that you want to save for by a certain date, and it'll set up automation so you can guarantee that you reach that.

So, this is what the goals look like. You can set a new goal like a new car, and you can see how much further you have to go to get to that place.One thing I really like about CoPilot, even though they are a subscription model, is that their values and pricing are super clear on their website.They don't have any hidden fees, there's no upsells, and it ends up costing less than two cups of coffee a month if you live in LA like me.

For me, this has been a totally worthwhile investment because I've just saved way more than I'm actuallypaying them. This next tool has helped me go from completely wasting entire days to havingtotal control over my time and attention. It's helped me eliminate procrastination andmake sure that I'm actually progressing towards the things that I care about. This started abouttwo years ago when I was listening to Rob Dyrdek on this podcast called My First Million. So,he's basically this super successful entrepreneur; he sold his company for $300 million and he'sactually the founder of Momentous Supplements, which you might have heard of before on AndrewHuberman's podcast. What really stood out tome with Rob Dyrdek is that even though he had a lot of different projects going on, he had totalcontrol and balance in his life, and he had the data to prove it.

He basically tracked his time meticulously every minute of the day so that he knows exactly how much time he's spending at hiswork, how much time he's spending with his family, how much time he's spending developing himself and his health.Because he does this religiously, he has the data to prove that he is in control of his time and attention.In the podcast he says, "I am human optimization," and that really stuck with me.I am human optimization. Since then,I also started to do something similar and the way that I've done that is with this app called Timelines.

I don't do it to such a high degree of accuracy as he does, but how I do it is that I start a timer whenever I'm working on somethingthat I actually want my attention to go to. So, if I'm working on YouTube, I'll start a timer andit'll start counting YouTube and the same for socializing, hanging out with my girlfriend, or reading books.

The reason why this is really important is because there's almost always a discrepancy between what we want to focus on andwhat we actually spend our time on, and by tracking our time, it makes it really clear to us.Out of all the apps that I tried, this is my favorite one because it has some automations that you canset up. So, for example, you can link it to your calendar and automatically track certain eventsor if you use a sleep tracker you can also connect that, and it'll automatically track the numberof hours that you slept. What you get after doing this is that you get a total breakdownof how you spend your time over a week or a month.

And so, this pie chart is essentially a representation of how your attention was spent.

Personally, this has been super useful for me because I can reflect on every single month and see whether or not my attentionwas actually directed in the way that I wanted it to ideally. The way that this has helped mebeat procrastination is by becoming super aware of how much time I was actually wasting.

You can't track what you can't manage, and once you start tracking your time and attention, yourealize how many more hours there are in the day and how much time you actually waste not spendingit in the way that you want at all. Even though Ido use my calendar for calls and different events, what I’ve learned over time is that the onlything you can manage is not your time on your calendar, but your attention.

The way that you can manage your attention is by tracking how muchof your attention is actually allocated to the things that you care about. Even though apps arereally amazing for tracking specific metrics, it’s not really that effective for fleeting thoughtsand ideas, and that’s where this next tool has helped me: it’s this pocket journal. Ifyou’ve seen some videos on my channel, then you’ve definitely already seen me mention this before,but the reason I wanted to include this is because the price-to-benefit ratio isstill so overpowered. A pocket notebook is the single best way to track your fleeting thoughts,ideas, and even to-dos. Getting a pocket notebookis kind of like the gateway drug to using a main notebook where you can actually write down longform ideas and thoughts. So, if you're thinkingof starting to journal, I highly recommend getting a pocket notebook and trying that out first.

Think of how many times you’re on the go andyou have a thought or idea, or you’re havinga conversation with somebody, and they tell yousomething that you want to actually write down. This could be a future business idea, this couldbe some book or movie that you want to look into later. There’s just so much friction to havingto get your phone, figure out what app youwant to open, and writing it down somewhere. Secondly, it might be weeks or months beforeyou actually go back to your Apple notes and see that thing that you wrote down.

I think this is one of those times where our phones are actually not enough for our ideas,because the ways that your ideas can express themselves are so dynamic. They could be an illustration, theycould be numbers, they could be just a scribble. The best way to capture that is with a pocketnotebook. So, the one that I use is the Field Notes Hard Cover, which I think has the best buildand portability. I have this pen that fits righthere; I’ll link in the description if you want that.

I also recommend doing that.If you’re curious about how I actually use my pocket notebook,you can check out the video that I made. I think when you start carrying a pocket notebook,you really start to see the world in a different way. When you have conversations with people,you can write it down. When you’re bored in line or on a train, instead of pulling out your phone,you can write down some ideas or journal about something really quickly in your notebook.

One person I really look up to in history is Leonardo da Vinci. If you’re not familiar withhim, he’s a super legendary artist, engineer, and inventor, and he’s really famous for hisnotebooks. Some of them have been sold for $30 million. In the book that I read about him,he told the student to always carry around a pocket notebook wherever they go. The reasonfor that is because he always uses his pocket notebook to sketch down different things he saw,to study things that he observed in real life, and to write down different ideas to look into later.

So, yeah, I would recommend getting a pocket notebook and creating something like that for yourself.

This next tool has been a super essential add-on for someone who uses a MacBook Pro as their maincomputer. One major issue that you might not realize with using a laptop as your maincomputer is that the form factor is actually extremely non-ergonomic. Because the monitoris below your eyeline, you're always going to be looking down, and this creates a lot of bad postureand neck strain, which has happened to me. This posture can really add up and cause a lot of majorneck issues later down the line. The way thatI have solved this is with an attachment that props your laptop up. This is a laptop stand bythe company Magex, and it attaches to the back of your MacBook or any laptop. It’s made of metal,so it’s super high quality compared to some of the ones that you might see on Amazon. Unlikea laptop stand that you have to pack up and put in your backpack, this just attaches to the back of it, so you always have it.

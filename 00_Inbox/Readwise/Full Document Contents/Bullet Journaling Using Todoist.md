- Summary: Steven Thompson discusses how he combines Bullet Journaling with the Todoist app to enhance productivity. He sets up an index, a tickler file for daily tasks, and logs for past, present, and future activities to stay organized. This method allows him to efficiently capture tasks and focus on what needs to be done without unnecessary clutter.

**Note**: Originally published at [Linda’s Brick Barn](https://lindasbrickbarn.com/steves-trip-reports/2019/4/25/bullet-journaling-using-todoist) on April 25, 2019 (series of three articles). The following is a consolidation of the series for publication on Medium.

By looking up this article, I assume you know a little about Bullet Journaling and perhaps a little or a lot about Todoist. I am, probably, like you, by nature, a “productivity student.”

Most of the “self-help” books conceived in the ’1970s and ’80s were full of vague concepts rather than practical applications. I became intimately familiar with the Franklin Planner but favored Stephen Covey’s philosophy and methods.

However, I soon grew tired of the weekly top-down approach from Mission to planning. I had trouble remembering to take out the garbage on Thursday, and Mr. Covey had me planning to take over the world.

David Allen’s methodology stood in stark relief to Mr. Covey’s top-down approach, and his bottom-up strategy to getting things done, i.e., taking out the garbage on Thursday, made a big difference in my life. The method involved clearing the runway (completing small daily items) and giving yourself the bandwidth to move higher in purposeful altitudes. The methodology resonated with me, and I have successfully kept “Getting Things Done” as my primary process at work.

Work has solid, defined edges, and thankfully, an astute branch manager who keeps things moving along smoothly. Inherently built into the workplace are projects, next actions, and the other essential context items of Mr. Allen’s approach.

Unfortunately, where things invariably get messy is having the same defined edges in my personal life.

### “Track the past, organize the present, and plan for the future” — Ryder Carroll.

A book outlining how to start a Bullet Journal appeared in my Kindle Unlimited. I downloaded the book, skimmed it, and quickly returned it after seeing all the fancy pages of paper and the artistic script and coloring for each day. But something stuck: this weird concept of daily logs, tasks, symbols, and events, capturing notes in short phrases, almost like shorthand, and using that to “track the past, organize the present, and plan for the future” was very appealing. However, I couldn’t bring myself to go back to paper and pencil.

I was bound and determined to use an electronic platform, and Todoist was still my preferred application. Somewhere during my readings, it dawned on me that with Todoist — I didn’t need an Index, i.e., the cornerstone in bullet journaling methodology. Todoist already provided an index on the left-hand side of the screen. Finally, with this insight, I quickly set up a tickler file, a daily log for notations, with a past and future record. That was 2019, and I continue to use the same process today.

### Building a Bullet Journal Using Todoist

If you are familiar with Todoist, you will have the index set up with a tickler system and past, present, and future logs in record time.

Here’s how step by step:

#### The Index

The index is composed of only two groupings of projects. Note: Everything in the index is a project, which you will create by pressing the “+” button or mousing over the project above where you want to insert the new item and, clicking on the three small dots, add a project. Todoist also offers drag-and-drop options.

#### First Group — Tickler File

Under Projects, create a project named Tickler File.  

Use the tickler file project to add everyday tasks such as “Take recycling to curb,” which occurs every other week. I have to do it, but I don’t want the reminder to clog up the critical items on my monthly calendar. I want to see it if I look at the day it’s due; however, I only need to see it once it is due.

Upon completion, Todoist allows me to automatically move the action forward to a specific date or timeframe, i.e., every 2 weeks.

Everyday items in the tickler file are things like water plants, backup Obsidian, meetings with my branch manager, morning routines, changing furnace filters, and even a reminder to change the towels in the guest bathroom. If you’re like me, a reminder that the chicken will expire in a week or the milk has been open for X number of days can avoid expensive waste.

#### Second Group — Past, Present, and Future Logs

#### Future logs

Future logs are straightforward, so set these up first. Under the Tickler File project, create a new main project called Future Log. Then, as children (indented slightly) create 12 monthly projects, i.e., April 2023, May 2023, June 2023, etc. I generally keep a running 12-month future log. In other words, when I start May 2023, I’ll add May 2024 to the bottom of my future log project. Although I recently had reason to add monthly projects through the end of 2024. Remember, there is no limit to the number of future logs you can create, but keep it workable.

Future logs serve one purpose: to provide a place to assign tasks on a future date — birthdays, conferences, holidays, appointments, etc. Many assignments will renew annually, such as birthdays and holidays; however, you’ll want them to show up in the month they occur versus the tickler file. Upon completion, manually move the task forward to the next occurrence.

#### Present Logs

Present logs are the bullet journaling that will occur today. Under the current month, create another child project (indented slightly) and title the project with today’s date. YYYY-MM-DD works best for my use case.

Create a task for everything you experience. Each lesson is a bullet journal notation and records the daily activities, readings, insights, phone calls, to-do’s, and notes. Add comments and capture links to articles and inspiration before they vanish. I create one main heading to grab all my readings in one location, i.e., Reading September 7, 2023. Each article is then a comment verifying the time I read the piece.

Present logs are designed to transfer non-actionable items captured to another system, such as Obsidian’s daily logs, or archived by month inside Todoist.

#### Past Logs

Past logs represent a built-in autofocus system to process actionable items captured during the bullet journaling method. Created by Mark Forster, the Autofocus Time Management System encourages a “little and often” approach to projects (1) perfect for the fast and short approach of a bullet journal.

#### Mark’s “Quick Start” section for Autofocus (updated for the Todoist process).

As you think of new items, add them to the current date.

Work through the list one page (day) at a time in the following manner:

1. Go to the oldest date in your index.
2. Read quickly through the items on that date without taking action on any of them.
3. Go through the day again more slowly, looking at the items until one stands out for you.
4. Work on that item for as long as you feel like doing so.
5. Add a comment if desired, and edit the task’s project by moving it forward to today’s project date if uncompleted.
6. Continue reviewing each day from oldest to newest. Only move on to the next date once you complete a review of the date without any items standing out.
7. Move to the following date and repeat the process.
8. Once you’ve finished with the final page (today’s date), re-start at the oldest date again. (2)

The secret to getting something done is often just getting started. I like the format of scanning, looking, thinking, and using your intuition to help pick an item. It also helps when personal energy levels are low; you may be cherry-picking the most simplistic items on the list, but the concept is the same: if it’s on the list and it catches your attention, then it needs to be done.

I delete the daily log when all items are completed. Removing empty dates keeps my Todoist clean and helps me focus my energy on only those items that continue to hold my attention. If things fail to move forward (meaning I’ve taken no action on the item) and can’t reform the task into more specific doable steps, I remove the thing from my logs.

The item might appear again in the future; however, the purpose of using Todoist for Bullet Journaling is not necessarily to get something done; it’s to create an environment where Todoist facilitates an ease of capture and allows me to make choices efficiently.

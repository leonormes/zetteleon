Calls have been made for the incoming Oxford Union president to resign after he appeared to cheer Charlie Kirk's fatal shooting.

The Oxford University student reportedly made comments on social media and WhatsApp that appear to make light of the 31-year-old's death.

Mr Kirk was a podcaster, culture warrior and ally of US president Donald Trump. He bolstered the Republican party’s get-out-the-vote drive in the 2024 US election based on the theory that there were thousands of Trump supporters who rarely vote, but could be persuaded to back him.

George Abaraonye reportedly posted “Charlie Kirk got shot, let’s f\*\*\*\*\*\* go” on WhatsApp, while another on his Instagram account read: “Charlie Kirk got shot loool.”

Pressure is now mounting on the politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) student to resign his role and even on the university to expel him.

But responding to the latter call, Oxford University's spokeswoman said: "We would never comment on individual disciplinary matters."

Responding to the backlash, Mr Abaraonye told the university's magazine he "reacted impulsively", insisting the views don't reflect his value but he fell short of an apology.

He said : "To be clear: nobody deserves to be the victim of political violence.

"Nobody should be harmed or killed for the views they hold.

"I may have disagreed strongly with Mr Kirk’s politics, but in death we all deserve respect, and I extend my condolences to his family and loved ones."

The MP and former treasurer of the Oxford Union, Gregory Stafford, said he is "disgusted" by the comments and has written to the returning officer urging for a disciplinary investigation.

He said: "The president of the Oxford Union is there to represent the union and its members.

"By his words, Mr Abaraonye has gravely undermined that responsibility and brought the union into serious disrepute."

Adrian Hilton, a member of the Oxford Union, said he will be resigning his membership over the union's "wholly inadequate" response.

He added: "If he is permitted to hold the office of president, I'll personally make sure that every speaker he invited is made aware that if he disagrees with their views, he'll be wishing they were murdered.

"There is simply no place for his far-left intolerance of reasoned right wing opinion."

Tobias Ellwood, a former MP and speaker on international defence, said: "As a former students' union president of my own university, I find it deeply troubling that a president-elect would celebrate Charlie Kirk's death.

"That alone raises questions about his suitability for the role. The Oxford Union should do the right thing."

Isabel Oakeshott, the political commentator, called for Mr Abaraonye to be expelled from university.

The Oxford Union said in a statement on Thursday evening it "unequivocally condemns" the words reportedly made by Mr Abaraonye.

The statement added: "In alignment with the statement published by our society earlier today, we reaffirm our stance that the Oxford Union firmly opposes all forms of political violence and strongly stands by our commitment to free speech and considerate debate."

Mr Kirk was speaking at a debate hosted by Turning Point USA at Utah Valley University when authorities said the assailant fired from a roof at 11.52am local time on Wednesday.

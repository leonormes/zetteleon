- Summary: When you get a cut or scrape, your body starts healing in three steps: inflammation, new tissue growth, and remodeling. First, blood clots form to stop bleeding and white blood cells clean the wound. Next, new skin and blood vessels grow, and finally, the wound strengthens and may leave a scar.

## Full Document
an injury to the skin such as a cut scrape or puncture wound kills nearby cells and damages underlying structures and triggers the complex process of repairing the skin wound healing is a three-step process the inflammatory phase begins immediately upon injury blood vessels 

constrict to reduce blood loss then platelets arrive to plug the leak the platelet plug initiates the clotting mechanism by facilitating the reactions of plasma proteins called clotting factors which interact to form a fibrin clot after the clot forms the blood 

vessels vasodilate and become more porous to allow white blood cells to leave the blood vessel and populate at the sight of injury during this process called phagocytosis white blood cells eat debris and kill bacteria reducing the risk of infection the proliferative phase begins 2 days to 3 weeks after injury the first 

step in the proliferative phase is granulation connective tissue cells called fibroblasts lay a matrix of collagen that reinforces the wound and provide structure for other cells collagen then contracts to pull together the margins of the wound angiogenesis or the growth of new blood vessels 

begins almost simultaneously and supplies oxygen to the repairing cells epithelialization is the restoration of the protective Skin Barrier epithelial cells migrate from the margins of the wound protected by the scab until they meet eventually the scab falls off the remodeling phase begins several 

weeks after the injury and can continue for years during this phase a new more organized collagen Matrix forms in the wound bed and capillaries disappear leaving an avascular scar one possible complication of wound healing is choid formation a choid results from an overgrowth of granulation tissue extending beyond the 

borders of the original wound composed of mostly collagen kids are slow growing they do not regress spontaneously and tend to reoccur after excision a common initial treatment for keloids includes multiple injections of corticosteroids to help reduce the size 

of the scar

As parents, teaching apologies comes with the territory, as does navigating the various [stages](https://www.netmums.com/life/why-all-these-headlines-about-kids-development-are-not-helping-parents) of children handling [tricky feelings](https://www.netmums.com/child/im-a-former-teaching-assistant-heres-how-to-handle-your-childs-big-end-of-term-emotions) and [big emotions](https://www.netmums.com/child/tweens-and-teens-11-years/tween-mood-swings-explained-why-10-11-year-olds-get-so-emotional-and-how-to-help).

And, psychologist [Dr Martha](https://www.drmarthapsychologist.com/) has stepped right into that conversation, striking a chord with parents... and teachers as she goes.

The mum-of-two has delivered a quiet little truth bomb with her latest Instagram post. It talks about how not all apologies need to be accepted, and while it's aimed at children, parents are reading it and instantly recognising themselves.

#### Children's apologies

She describes a moment at home: her two-year-old apologised for pulling her sister’s hair, and her older child replied, ‘It’s okay.’ And it was those two little words that made her chest tighten.

She writes: ‘Growing up, I thought saying sorry was polite. When someone apologised to me, my automatic response is “that’s okay”… even when it wasn’t. Even when I was still hurt.’

And so many parents – judging by the comments – totally get that. She explains that we learn early on that smoothing things over made everything easier. Keep the peace, swallow the feeling, don’t rock the boat. Before long you’re a fully grown adult saying ‘it’s fine’ when absolutely nothing is fine.

She doesn’t want that for her kids. So she’s giving them better language. In the caption she explains that when someone apologises, her children can say ‘I accept your apology.’ or, ‘Thank you for saying sorry. I’m not ready to accept your apology yet. I’m still hurt.’

It sounds tiny, but it’s huge really. It gives kids permission to be honest, not polite. It slows the moment down and it teaches them that their feelings matter just as much as the other person’s.

Dr Martha puts it beautifully: ‘Apologies aren’t magic. Saying sorry does not erase the harm that’s been done. They open the door to repair. But only when your child decides they’re ready to walk through it.’

And then the line parents are screenshotting everywhere: ‘If you teach your kids their feelings matter don’t forget to teach them this too. No more “it’s okay” when it’s not.’

#### Parents connected with it straight away

The comments under her post are full of people seeing themselves. One parent wrote: 'I feel SO seen!'

Another said: ‘It hits home. I have been trying to do this for a while. I have to consciously stop myself from saying “it’s okay”… It’s easier at home but I still struggle with people I don’t know.’

Another said: ‘Sometimes it isn’t ok, and if kids learn to sit with that discomfort young, it’s so helpful later in life.’

While this mum added her own example: ‘My daughter tells me “I’m angry and I need time”. I must try and respect that. I was taught to get on with it and be happy. All emotions and responses are valid.’

#### Teachers are backing it too

Several teachers commented to say this is exactly what they try to model in school: ‘I’ve been teaching this for years in the primary schools I’ve worked in. It’s so important for kids to know certain behaviours are not ok.’

Another said: ‘I told a girl in my class today that it isn’t “fine”, but she can say thank you for apologising.’

Others pointed out the problem with forced apologies: ‘I don’t force an apology before the person is ready. Empty apologies mean nothing and the body can sense that.’

#### Some parents had questions

A few weren’t sure, writing: ‘What about if it is genuinely ok? Kids are more forgiving than adults.’

And there’s the balance. No one is saying children can never say ‘it’s okay’. The point is to help them pause long enough to notice whether they mean it.

So what can parents actually do with all this? Netmums researched Dr Martha's content, [Dr Becky Kennedy](https://www.goodinside.com/about/) and [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/).

The short of it is, you don’t need to overhaul your whole approach to conflict. This is more of a gentle tweak – a few small habits that help kids tell the truth about their feelings instead of rushing to please.

**Slow moments down –** Instead of jumping straight into referee mode, give everyone a breather. A simple ‘Let’s take a second’ stops the automatic ‘it’s okay’ slipping out.

**You can model the language yourself –** Use the phrases Dr Martha suggests in front of your kids so they hear what real, honest repair sounds like. It feels awkward at first, but it becomes natural much quicker than you think.

**Stop forcing quick apologies –** Kids know when they’re being nudged into saying sorry before they’re ready. Let the apology come when it’s real — it means far more.

**Show them that hurt and forgiveness don’t have to happen at the same speed** – A child can still be kind while also saying they’re not ready. That’s a life skill most adults are still learning.

**Remind them, and yourself, that honesty doesn’t make anyone ‘difficult’** – It just makes the repair honest rather than rushed.

What Dr Martha is offering isn’t a script, it’s permission for kids to feel things fully, and for parents to guide them without overriding their emotions.

Who knows, as we teach our children not to say ‘it’s okay’ when it’s not, we’ll finally stop doing it too.

#### 5 FAQs about children apologising

**1. Why did Dr Martha’s post resonate so strongly with parents?**  

 Her message touched on something many adults recognise in themselves – the habit of saying “it’s okay” even when they’re still hurt. Parents saw their own childhoods in her story, along with the pressure to smooth things over rather than express how they really feel.

**2. What is Dr Martha suggesting children say instead of 'it’s okay'?**  

 She encourages phrases that are more honest and respectful of feelings, such as “I accept your apology,” or “Thank you for saying sorry. I’m not ready to accept your apology yet.” These responses help children slow down and notice how they truly feel.

**3. Why is this approach helpful for children?**  

 It gives them permission to be truthful instead of polite, teaches emotional awareness, and shows them that their feelings matter just as much as someone else’s. It also helps them understand that apologies don’t magically erase hurt – they’re the beginning of repair, not the end.

**4. Is the idea that children should never say “it’s okay”?**  

 Not at all. Children can absolutely say it when they genuinely mean it. The aim is simply to help them pause long enough to work out whether they do, rather than responding automatically.

**5. How can parents start putting this into practice?**  

 Small steps make a big difference. Slowing heated moments down, modelling the language yourself, avoiding rushed or forced apologies, and reminding children that hurt and forgiveness don’t have to happen at the same pace all help build more honest, healthy repair after conflicts.

## Full Document
So, Google just released Gemini CLI, their own autonomous coding agent. It's completely open source. It has 1 million context window, and you get 1,000 queries per day for free. This is a serious competitor to both Codex and Cloud Code. And in this video, I'll show you how to set it up, how it compares to Clot Code, and how to get the most out of it. So, stay tuned. All right. So, just type in Gemini CLI into Google and click on the first GitHub link. This will take you to the official GitHub page from Google. So, let's scroll down 

and I'll show you how to set up step by step because it's actually very simple, right? You don't have to be afraid if you don't know how to use the terminal or if you're not a programmer. First step, what we have to do is npm install-google/mini cli. So, just copy this command. Open any terminal and simply paste it in and hit enter. This will start installing Gemini on your system. Now, as they say, the only prerequisite is that you have NodeJS version or above installed. So, here is the link. Again, I'm going to link the GitHub repo below the video, but if you don't have NodeJS on your system, which you definitely should 

have, just click on this link and download Node.js again, version 18 or higher for your system. Once you have Gemini installed with this command, it runs for a few seconds. So then, if you type Gemini into your terminal, boom, there it is. Gemini is launched. This command as well, you should probably run it uh every morning because that's also how you keep Gemini CLI updated. But now let's move on to cursor and we're going to be using it in an actual production ready codebase. Gemini 2.5 Pro which is what Gemini CLI is built upon. The best 

model from Google has a five times higher context window than cloud for opus and cloud for set. And these are the only two models you can use in cloth code. So if you have a large code base, this might be the best coding agent for you. Anyways, once you're in cursor, just press command J to open the terminal or control J if you're on Windows. Type in Gemini. Boom. Just like that, it will open. And again, if you haven't authenticated yet, you'll have to choose a theme, which you can also change anytime with um slash theme. Here 

you have a lot of options. Actually, to be honest, I like the default light. So, I'm going to select that. And also, it will ask you to authenticate. So, if you do slash off, this is what Gemini will look like when you first run it, right? You have three different options. Login with Google, Gemini API key, and Vert.Ex AI. The simplest one is obviously login with Google. However, there is different things you should consider. Now, as I said before, you get literally 1,000 queries per day for free. Thousand queries per day. Most people will not hit that. Let's be honest. Most people 

will not even get close to 1,000 prompts a day. Which means Gemini CLI for most of you will be completely free. However, there are a few things to consider. With the login with Google, you get a thousand messages for free, but Google will train on your data if you use your own API key. And basically if you pay, Google will not use your data. So again, if you use a big code base that is on a business that you do not own and you cannot share the data, then you should probably be using API key. Plus, you get 

the added benefit of not being randomly downgraded. If you log in with Google and you're using the 1,000 free messages per day, a lot of the times, especially during the peak periods of usage, you get downgraded to Gemini 2.5 Flash. So hopefully that doesn't happen. But if you have your own startup or you just want to vibe code something from scratch, login with Google. It's the simplest way. If you want to make sure you're using the best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro. And if you don't want Google to train on your data, make sure to set up your API key in Google AI Studio. Make sure you fill out your billing details. That way, you're actually paying. And by 

the way, Gemini models are some of the most cost effective AI models in the world. So, I would recommend going with the Gemini API key unless you really want to save money. In that case, just login with Google. Anyways, let me first close all the other cloth codes here because I use a lot of cloth code. Okay. And then also you can just rename it to Gemini CLI and pin the terminal. That way you don't accidentally close it. So this is how your workspace honestly should look like inside of cursor. One autonomous agent here and then maybe the file here or if you want to be tryh hard 

like me, a second autonomous agent on the right. So literally most of my time I don't even have a single file open. Obviously, you can still switch to the files at any time and see the code yourself, but the beauty of these autonomous coding engines is that when they are changing any of the files, they show you the differences. So really, all you need to do is have Gemini on one half of the screen, cloud code on the other half, and just vibe code with both of them. So since we created a Gemini MD file, you can see above chat, it's 

saying using one Gemini MD file. So it's using these instructions, but this is this is very vague, right? This is like 20 lines of prompts. This is not good at all. So what we need to do is we need to tell it locate the that Gemini folder. And the reason for that is if we go back to the documentation, we can actually see uh uh if we scroll down a bit. Okay, so I found it. You need to go to docs CLI and then configuration MD. It's a bit um you know hidden, but okay. Why 

are we getting errors here? Wait a second. Too many requests. resource exhausted. Okay, so uh the bad news is that they seem to be overloaded. I don't know what's happening, but my API key is not working. Let me know guys if you encounter this in the comments, but I had to switch the off back to my Google login, right? Which does seem to be working. So, I don't know. I don't know what's wrong with the API method. Maybe they'll patch it in the next update. Who knows? But basically, I wanted to run this prompt, locate the Gemini folder. 

And the reason for that is if we go into the docs into Gemini CLI doc CLI configuration here we will see a very important section right so I read a lot of the docs and here this section basically shows how to use the settings.json so let's see if it located that okay we don't see a Gemini folder let's see settings.json JSON. Okay. Yeah, we don't have a Gemini folder. So, we need to create one. So, let's go back to the web. And this is what we need to 

create. So, say okay. Then create this file and folder. Boom. Settings.json. The reason for that is it allows us to reuse some prompts. Here's an example that I tweeted yesterday evening. By the way, if you want to get my thoughts in real time on all of these new AI updates that just come out, just follow me on Twitter at David Andre one. It's the easiest way to stay up to date with all the other tips. And yeah, here's the tip. Okay, so when you create Gemini, okay, so we need to 

allow this. Yes, Gemini folder and it wants to write this file and we need to add the following context file name agents.md. Why? because this makes Gemini CLI use your hopefully optimized agents.mmd. Again, if you're watching my videos, you will have an agent.mmd file, especially if you're in the new society because in the new society in the classroom, I have an entire step-by-step workshop on the ultimate codex guide, which takes you from the COX setup, GitHub fundamentals, 

my COX workflow, Codex variations, PR review, COX internet access, and my new Codex workflow with cloth code and cursor. So yeah, this is available in the classroom inside of the new society. Make sure to join. But the whole point of this tweet is so that you don't have to write a new prompt file because it's it's getting, you know, overwhelming with so many files. So Gemini CLI created this settings.json. So you can just open it settings.json in the Gemini folder. Let's put it to our second half. So instead of um you 

know going with the Gemini MD file, which is fine. This is better than nothing for sure. Most people will not even bother creating any system file which is terrible. The better method, however, is to delete this file. So, let me just delete that. Boom. And put this in into your Gemini/ setting JSON. Actually, make sure to remove this HTTP. I don't know how that got copied over, but the JSON needs to look like this. Context file name agents.mmd. And if we restart, let's say we kill this. Boom. 

Clear. And type in Gemini. You can easily start it from any terminal just by typing Gemini. There it is. using one agents.md file. So basically this redirects Gemini telling it, hey instead of using the gemini.mmd file, here is where we have the context. This is the context file name. That way you can use the same file and keep improving your file, you know, whatever you're using for codeex or for cloth code. And here like I have 400 lines of instructions, right? So instead of me having to craft 

a new gemini.mmd file from scratch, I can use my highly optimized 400 line prompt for codecs that I use every single day and I can instantly use that for Gemini CLI, making it way more powerful and way more useful for my own codebase. So let's get to building with Gemini CLI. Of course, I'm going to be building my AI startup Veali, which by the way, if you're not using Vectal, this might be the easiest way to increase your productivity. Why? Because 

we have all of the best AI models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, powering our AI agents that can create tasks, help you complete tasks, do web research using Perplexity Pro, and so much more. If you're still using outdated task management tools like To-Doist, ClickUp, Notion, just go to Vectorai, sign up, you can get started for completely for free. Take 10 minutes to move your tasks over and you will never look back. the ability to chat with the best AI models that know everything about your tasks that know what projects you have active 

which by the way in each project you can set a custom system prompt which this is not available in any other productivity or task management tool these AI agents are aware of that are aware of your user context which allows them to be a lot more useful than just the default chat GBD or default clot so again go to vectal.ai AI create an account, move your tasks over, and you will never look back. So, what I want to do with Gemini, I want to improve the icons right here. So, again, let's go back to chat. Let me 

refresh. So, I'm adding these icons for the feedback of the chat, right? That way, we can have a clear feedback loop of how good of a job the agent did. So, for example, here it did exactly what I wanted. So, I would give a thumbs up. But let's say you ask create four tasks and it only creates two. Well, that would be a thumbs down. So basically I'm adding this feedback mechanism. But right now the buttons are a bit too visible I would say. So I wrote a prompt. Your task is to improve the design of the thumbs up thumbs down buttons in and then I tag the file which 

by the way the tagging of files in Gemini CLI is very fast. Instead of using these yellow emojis which are way too visible. Let's use the thumbs up icons from Lucid React. Let's see how good Gemini CLI is at front end design. Okay. So, we got downgraded to 2.5 flash, which is unfortunate because uh I would like to be using 2.5 Pro, but I don't know why the API key method isn't working. Uh maybe maybe it's just overloaded. I mean, they must have some crazy demand right now because they just released it. And I mean, let me know guys if you've encountered this error with using the API key or how to solve 

it. I I would be more than happy to do that. So, comment below if you know how to solve that because I really don't want to be using 2.5 flash. Okay, so 2.5 flash failed. I mean, I'm trying to compare it to cloth code, but it's difficult because Gemini 2.5 flash is nowhere near good as cloth for opus or cloth for set. I cannot seem to copy. What? When I copy my prompt, it copies the response. Okay, let's just do up arrow. Oh, this box appears always. So, yeah, this is 

one of the tools that Gemini has access to, which is the read many files tool, and it still didn't update it. I'm waiting for the instructions. Let's try a close code. Like I'm I'm guaranteeing you Clo will oneshot this. Keep in mind Cloore has been out for like over what almost two months and Gemini CLI released literally less than 24 hours ago. So yeah, I'm I'm trying to give an honest review. I'm not trying to overhype. You know, Gemini CLI has some massive advantages. And there it is. Cloth code was able to oneshot it no 

problem. Like to be fair, 1 million context window, as I showed earlier, is much better than 200,000. Also, the fact that you get 1,000 free queries per day is huge for a lot of people. The fact that Gemini CLI is open source is also huge because you can literally fork it and build your own coding agent, maybe using different models, maybe customizing the problems, whatever. So, this is a huge power move from Google open sourcing Gemini CLI, whereas cloth code and codex are not fully open 

source, right? However, at the end of the day, what matters is how good the agent is. And when it struggles doing a simple prompt, this is nothing crazy, guys. Like, changing the icons is a simple prompt. And when it struggles to do even that, whereas cloth code, its biggest competitor, oneshotss that no problem, yeah, Google needs to do some polishing. Again, I still believe Gemini CLI has major potential due to the factors I listed, but it's been less than 24 hours since they released it. So for now, cloud code is clearly better, 

but I would keep testing cha CLI and maybe like in a week when it gets through like a bunch of updates, maybe they'll be back uh especially if we can get the API method working so that we can always use Gemini 2.5 Pro, not Flash because Flash is a much worse model. So again, comment below if you've been able to solve that API error. But for now, cloth code is the clear winner. If you're going to choose which to use, use cloth code. If you don't have any money, Gemini CLI is a great alternative. Now, 

if you want me to make a more in-depth video because this was largely about the setup and the differences compared to other tools. There's a lot of stuff to cover such as the tools within Gemini CLI. It has a lot of tools. Also, MCPS, how to connect MCPS and run it with MCP servers. Also, the memory, right? It has an interesting way of managing memory, which is like stored nodes or anything else about your project or your preferences. Also, the web search. So, Gemini CLI has the ability to browse the web. song say browse the web about latest news about a new coding agent 

from Google. Let's see if it finds info about itself. This is a major advantage because obviously Google owns Google search, right? So they built it in into Gemini CLI so it can get documentation faster check the web and there's also a custom separate tool called web fetch where you can give it a website and it gives you it basically crawls it completely. See, it's using the Google search tool right here. Latest news for coding agent Google. So, yeah, there's a lot more stuff to cover. I could go on 

for another hour, hour and a half. If you watch my previous cloth code videos, you know that that's true. So, if you want me to go even more in depth into Gemini CLI, comment part two. If I see a lot of comments saying part two, I will make a very in-depth advanced video on Gemini CLI and post it in the next week or so. With that being said, thank you guys for watching. If you haven't already, go to Vector Laria and sign up. Especially if you have a team. If you're a small or medium-sized business, join the team plan. Everybody on your team 

will have access to the cutting edge AI models in the app. Let's be honest, it's very hard to get your employees to use AI tools like chat GPD, Cloud, Perplexity if they're not built in into the software that you're using. This is the problem that Vector solves. Plus, as I showed you, you can have custom system prompts for each project. So let's say let's say you have a software project right here and you say our text tag is this this the current focus of Q3 is boom boom and you put in focus for each project you save it and when you select 

that project which by the way you can easily favorite it the AI agents will know what the focus of that project is and they will adapt the responses to that for all people in that project. Plus, if you go with the vectal team plan, you can also give a custom system prompt to every person on your team so that Vectal knows, okay, this person is a video editor, this person is a developer, and it adapts the responses to them. Moving your team to vectal has to be the easiest way to instantly boost the productivity of all the people on your team. So, simply go to vector, get 

the team plan, move your team over, and suddenly you became an AI first company. With that being said, thank you guys for watching. Let me know what you think of Gemini CLI. And if you want me to make another video on it, comment below part two and I'll make it happen. With that being said, thank you guys for watching and have a wonderful, productive week.

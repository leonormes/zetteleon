- Summary: Business agreements often stay as static files, creating hidden technical work for developers. That causes siloed data, fragile custom workflows, and extra security and maintenance burden. Turning agreements into structured, integrated data cuts technical debt and lets teams move faster and safer.

When we talk about business agreements, we often think about how they impact profits, customers and legal teams. However, there’s a less obvious cost that’s usually overlooked — something developers know all too well. Behind every contract, approval and workflow based on agreements, there are technical challenges that engineering teams need to overcome.

For example, when agreements are digitized but still stuck in static files, there’s no structure, visibility or integration with key business systems. This “[agreement trap](https://www.docusign.com/blog/agreement-trap)” is not just about how it impacts business performance. It also creates friction, adds complexity and introduces risks for developers and architects. As [Julian Macagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmacagno/), director of product management at Docusign, explained in an interview, this happens when digital agreements aren’t truly integrated or structured. Instead, they remain passive documents, forcing developers to bridge the gap with time-consuming and fragile solutions.

#### Agreements as a Source of Engineering Debt

Traditionally, agreements have been viewed as simple business documents — files exchanged between people, signed, stored in shared drives and filed away for future reference. However, agreements play active roles in many product workflows, including onboarding users, provisioning services, granting permissions and closing transactions.

Developers face several [challenges](https://thenewstack.io/docusign-expands-its-developer-community-with-new-platform) when managing agreement solutions. These include writing custom code, dealing with complex manual integrations with external services and APIs and lacking clear visibility into the agreement’s life cycle and data post-signature. Moreover, security reviews and maintenance of these integration systems can be intricate and time-consuming, leading to a heightened risk of security vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

Macagno relayed some of the ways these pain points add up for developers:

* No visibility into what’s in an agreement — data is locked.

[David Gonzalez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gonzalez-pnw/), a senior engineering manager at Docusign, echoed this. “Customers want to export data from envelopes, workflows and accounts. They expect these capabilities to exist already, or behave differently,” he said.

As a result, developers find themselves managing a complex collection of APIs, manually parsing static agreement data and struggling to enable end-to-end workflows. Agreements have inadvertently become confusing obstacles rather than valuable tools for business insights.

#### How Disorganized, Siloed Data Complicates Development

Agreements must be transformed into structured, accessible components that directly integrate with core product systems. This change enables the development of more efficient, scalable and reliable software infrastructure.

Without this transformation, engineering teams encounter disorganized agreement logic dispersed across numerous services and systems. Each workflow handles agreements uniquely, leading to inconsistencies that block and complicate the development and upkeep of agreement management systems. They not only impede development but also heighten the risk of data discrepancies as businesses grow and business processes evolve.

Custom workflows created to handle agreements are another common point of friction. They are usually complex, difficult to maintain and fragile by design, often breaking when external dependencies change or internal processes are updated. Developers must spend time fixing these processes and researching dependency compatibility — rather than working on high-impact tasks or innovating on the processes — for fear of breaking them completely.

Agreement data is also typically siloed and hard to access. Even after agreements are signed, the information inside them is often locked in static formats like PDFs, with little to no visibility unless it’s manually extracted. This lack of accessibility makes it challenging to build automation, maintain up-to-date records or discover key product insights.

Finally, systems that rely on agreements are cut off from one another, which severely limits operational agility. Without [proper integration](https://thenewstack.io/building-integrations-with-ai-assistance-that-go-beyond-vibes) between agreement tools and core platforms like customer relationship management (CRM) or identity systems, teams have no choice but to tolerate inefficient handoffs, duplicate work and error-prone manual processes. This can slow down how quickly a business can innovate and develop, making it more challenging to grow and expand.

By facing these challenges and treating agreements as the structured, valuable components they are, engineering teams can reduce technical debt, enhance collaboration and open up new opportunities for innovation.

#### Reimagining Agreements as Data

As platforms and digital products evolve, the demand for organized agreement logic and readily accessible data is growing in tandem. Engineering teams are seeking to develop internal platforms, shareable microservices and tools where agreement workflows can be as programmable and observable as any other part of the system’s processes.

Agreements are now more than just legal or sales documents buried in cloud storage; they are essential parts of what systems engineers create and maintain. Instead of viewing agreements as simple documents, they should be viewed as dynamic, intelligent components that can be leveraged and integrated throughout the entire application stack.

This involves transforming agreements into searchable resources that provide access to key product data, ensuring compliance through built-in traceability, enabling cohesion for data exchange between previously incompatible systems and designing them to be reusable across different workflows. When agreements become intelligent, flexible elements, developers can iterate, innovate and collaborate far more effectively than ever before.

The agreement trap is an insidious and technical beast. We need to begin recognizing agreements not merely as documents, but as essential infrastructure. Developers need tools that reflect this importance, and Docusign is stepping up to the plate.

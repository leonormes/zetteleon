## Full Document
As with anyone who is in the productivity/technology space, I am always on the lookout for new tools to improve my workflow and thus my life. One that has caught my eye for many years was Readwise: a service that promises to increase the value and enjoyment of your reading.

#### What Readwise Does:

Readwise is a software that functions as a link between your highlights and your note taking app. You start by making a highlight, say on your Kindle, and Readwise takes that highlight, throws it into their database, and then throws it into any of the many supported note taking apps. That’s the core offering. But it is not what makes Readwise magical.

Readwise’s true value, from my experience, comes from the review feature. I have read many, many books throughout the years and every single one of them have shifted my thinking or knowledge in some manner. However, as the months go by from my initial read, I start to forget about some tangential points that also hide insight and eventually will forget about the crux of the book itself. To do so is human, but it also kind of sucks. That’s where Readwise’s review feature comes in. Every day a random number of highlights will be surfaced and sent to your email or can be accessed on Readwise itself. This is simply phenomenal, I have begun to receive insights that the me from 3 years ago thought important but was unable to retain which has had a real impact on my retention of books.

Fortunately, the review feature is not truly random if you don’t want it to be: you can choose the frequency of how much a certain medium or a certain item is resurfaced. Additional value is added through the ability to tag and leave notes on your highlights which allows you to inject insights with your ideas and organize them in a specific manner. This works especially well with the note-taking app Obsidian, as all your notes become ever more linked, just as the neurons of your brain.

Beyond those core offerings, Readwise also offers methods to memorize your highlights through mastery. However, I do not wish to memorize all those highlights, I simply wish to be able to review them and so I have not interacted with this feature too much, nor does it interrupt what I want out of the app.

Additionally, I want to take a moment to appreciate just how many sources Readwise is able to import from. Kindle, Libby, Medium, Twitter even competitors to thier Read-it-Later app (more on that later) like Pocket, Instapaper, and Raindrop. Another one that I find really special is the Supplemental Books option, which adds the most popular highlights of books you select to your Readwise library; an essential for audiobook listeners such as myself. There are so many more, your notes can arrive from almost anywhere and can go almost anywhere.

For many years, Readwise had offered these services to anyone willing to fork up $8 per month. Which is frankly a staggering amount for me. Yes, Readwise had given thousands of users a significant amount of value, but I just was not at the position to be able to pay $8 when I could always painstakingly copy paste all my highlights manually and then look over them periodically. The price was an issue until Readwise added and refined the other part of its full service: Readwise Reader.

#### Reading Articles (A Tangential Rant)

I am a voracious book reader, taking a stab at anything that may seem remotely interesting and learning more than I could have imagined. But even more than books, I read articles. They support me whenever I have a 10–20 minute gap in my day to fill instead of scrolling through social media or watching Youtube. My article consumption has always been on the news source’s official app, which is usually fairly well made these days. However I had 2 problems with this way of reading:

1. I have always found it difficult to take notes through the official app. I used to send a link to the article to Apple Notes and then write my thoughts and copy quotes over but it was an archaic approach and whenever I got lazy (which was a lot) I would just not take a note and lose out on whatever I learned from that article
2. The reading experience can be messy. Many apps display ads even though I pay for subscriptions to the site, some don’t make the font go big enough or change to a font I like reading. And none of them sync my progress between the various devices I read on depending on the context.

Basically, I love reading fantastic works of journalism and staying up to date with the news but I hated the manner of which these works were presented to me. Which brings me back to Readwise Reader.

#### Enter: Readwise Reader

Reader is the answer to absolutely all my problems and even adds value in places I did not expect. Reader is a Read-it-later app, meaning you can send articles and other media to it and it will extract the text and images and reformat it to your specifications while preserving authorial intent. Reader has a way to be accessed on most devices, and syncs unbelievably fast. This completely demolishes problem number 2.

As for problem number 1, in line with the Readwise spirit, Reader is a note-taking wonder. Highlighting is fast and easy, and adding notes to highlights is just as simple. Tags organize your workflow and everything immediately rushes to Readwise (both apps use the same database). In just 3 days of using Reader I had already amassed 37 valuable highlights, and this was a rather busy period!

#### **Where Reader Goes Beyond What I Wanted**

Reader just looks beautiful. From the first time I clicked onto their website it caught my eye and I knew that was the reading environment was for me. I understand that there are other apps out there that may look even better, Matter comes to mind, but Reader still pleases me aesthetically.

Reader supports (almost) everything. I have used it to read articles of course, but also newsletters, PDFs, books (in the form of EPUBS), and tweet threads. Personally, I think the EPUB reading does still need some work, but it suffices for now. Newsletters in particular have been a favourite of mine. No longer is my email clogged up every morning, instead I can go into Reader and pick out whatever is important to me with my morning coffee.

Reader even functions as a way to watch Youtube, with a transcription to support note taking. The video is extracted into Readwise and can be viewed without any distracting comments or suggestions to drag you into a world of procrastination (we’ve all been there).

Reader also functions effectively as an RSS reader. I personally do not tend to use this feature too much because my publications of choice don’t have well-rounded RSS capabilities and also because I prefer to pick and choose what I want to read. Still, I can imagine this is a nice-to-have for many people.

Supporting basically everything is one thing, supporting everything without becoming a mess is another. Reader also shines here. It has many different views which, once you understand the layout and intensions, makes managing all that media a breeze (this is an area where Instapaper freaked me out when I last used it). And this is a deceptively important thing to get right. When easy to consume media such as Twitter and Reddit is available just a few taps away, Reading should also be as simple as possible.

Another interesting feature for busy users is the ability to turn any article into speech using a fairly life-like voice. I have seen many people praise this feature heavily, and have given it some use myself, but it is not something I am a heavy user of.

Another surprising feature was how simple the offline reading experience was. I didn’t have to click any extra buttons, just opening an article without wifi worked anywhere. This was really nice because I have been travelling over the holidays and was able to bring my articles with me with no stress. The concern that this would make Reader take up a lot of storage has been unfounded for the most part thus far, but this may be an area to keep an eye on.

Speaking of stress, the customer support Readwise provides has been absolutely phenomenal from everything I have read and experienced. Almost every post on the subreddit [r/readwise](https://www.reddit.com/r/readwise/) has a response from an employee which effectively reduces consumer confusion and fosters an incredible community feeling.

Reader calls itself “The First Read-it-Later App Built For Power Users”. Sometimes this terminology is an empty promise, a buzzword to entice those of us who want to do more with technology. Not so with Reader. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts make notetaking as easy as can be, a paragraph focus line makes getting into the flow of reading much easier, and you can just tell that the app is made for serious desktop use over passive phone scrolling (although it does that very well too).

Another buzzword that has also been thrown around a lot this year has been “AI”, and yes, Reader has it too. However, I honestly have to say Reader does AI tastefully. “Ghostreader”, based on GPT-3, will summarize documents (which I use to leave a little note at the end for future reference), generate throught-provoking questions (helpful when dealing with a dicey subject manner and to vary your thinking), generate Q&A pairs based on your highlights (to use with flashcards I’d imagine), and allow you to ask the document questions. Custom prompting is also available, but I tend to just use ChatGPT for that.

A fun, powerful little add-on is Readwise’s web highlighter. Not only does it automatically save any article into Reader from the web, it also allows you to highlight straight from the web as well. This means if you want to read any article in the way it’s presented but still want to take Reader-style notes on it, you have the power to do so. I use this when the website I am annotating uses a really suprising format.

Readwise does so, so, so much more and I know I said this would be a comprehensive review but it is simply unfeasible to discuss everything. I have attempted to tackle the most high-value features here that I am sure most people would greately appreciate.

#### Readwise’s Pricing and Business Model — A Close Look

Let’s face it: Readwise is expensive. As the table below shows, most of what you’d want Readwise for costs $4.49 and for the full package, with Reader, its $7.99. I’ve spend a great deal of time outlining the value that Readwise provides for this price, and I genuinely do think the pricing is worth it for all that value. It is important to note that Readwise is 50% off if you are a member of academia (including students), member of military, first responders or you live in a country where the currency is depressed or the nation is developing.

However, the pricing and features do not tell the full story at face value. This is something I have not seen any other review mention but I think it is a critical point: Readwise is bootstrapping. This means that the company will not be looking for external investments, such as Venture Capital, to raise fundings. Which is extremely rare and extremely beneficial.

Now its important to caveat that VC firms have been very important to the software and hardware landscape, and without their contributions, the industry would be nowhere near as capable as it is now. This does not mean that VC firms are perfect. They prioritize scale through quick growth which works for 99.9% of companies due to the basic forces of economies of scale and competitive positioning. However, I firmly believe that Readwise is in the 0.1%. As much as we love it, reading is already fairly niche these days. Reading digitally is even more niche, and reading digitally for self-improvement and knowledge is yet even narrower of a niche. If you don’t believe me, just look at Readwise’s own website which claims that about 1700 people are using Readwise, which is almost ubiquitous in the space.

This makes astronomic scale almost impossible to achieve without developing too fast and losing sight of the core product offering. Focusing on the core offering is exactly what Readwise does so well. Yes, its been 2 years and Reader is still in beta, but Reader also fits into Readwise’s grand vision and is not just a flashy waste of development time and effort to bring on more people while alienating current users. Additionally, it makes Readwise much more likely to stick around in comparison to other equity-fuelled companies, because as long as even a few users continue to pay, they should have no obligations that drag them into insolvency. This makes me much more comfortable with using and becoming intrenched in the Readwise Ecosystem, but also makes the price of Readwise higher.

That brings me to the planned price hike. Yes, this hike will make Readwise go from expensive, to down-right indulgent for some people. But old users who have supported the company thus far will continue paying the same price, and hopefully the new users will help Readwise pay for further features and make the app thrive for many years to come.

#### A Few Complaints

This does not mean that Readwise is perfect of course, as with any piece of software I do have some gripes about it (although these are, admittedly, extremely minor):

1. The Readwise app and website do look *slightly* dated, but I’ll excuse it because of how wonderful Reader is and how little time I actually need to spend on it
2. There is no official Apple Notes integration (which is my preferred app for mobile content viewing) but I found [this apple shortcut](https://www.reddit.com/r/readwise/comments/141av0n/apple_shortcuts_for_readwise_integration/) on reddit which does the job good enough and will tide me over until we (maybe) get an official one.
3. Books do not have page turn, which is honestly great once you get used to the scroll method but might put off new users so I would like to see it as an option
4. This is the big one: Reader and Kindle/other sources do not merge. So if I read a book and highlight it on both, they will both show up as different entries on Readwise which is quite the annoyance.

Overall, Readwise definitely has my stamp of approval. Since this is my first article, I would appreciate any and all feedback and let me know if there is any other software, or any other topic you would like me to cover, I am not a picky researcher.

## Full Document
The exceptional entrepreneur Elon Musk always managed to find time for his kids, all while working [120+ hours per week](https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/how-to-manage-efficiently-working-80-hours-week/) and making plans with NASA to colonize Mars – thanks to a time management technique called **time blocking**.

Here’s everything you need to know about this productivity strategy that will help you pursue big plans, but still spend time with loved ones:

* What is time blocking?
* How to time block your schedule
* Time blocking tips
* Time blocking apps

#### What is time blocking?

Time blocking, or calendar blocking, involves defining specific time blocks for the tasks, events, and activities in your life, and then scheduling them against your calendar. You can schedule and follow time blocks for both business and personal tasks.

The gist of this time management technique is simple:

1. Add all your daily or weekly tasks to a to-do list
2. Select specific time slots in your calendar and reserve them for the tasks
3. Work on the tasks during the prescribed time blocks, and aim to complete them before it’s time for the next time block

![example of blocked time](https://clockify.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/example-of-blocked-time.png)
As mentioned, Elon Musk was the one who made this time management technique popular – he’d often work in 5-minute time blocks while he was the acting chairman of Tesla and SpaceX. Apart from helping him successfully run two colossal companies, time blocking also helped Musk exercise twice a week and spend about 4 days of quality time per week with his children.

#### How to time block your schedule

Now that you’ve understood the gist of time blocking, here’s how it all works in more detail.

Time blocking involves 4 main steps you need to follow:

* Plan everything
* Define time blocks
* Act on your schedule
* Test and revise

##### 1. Plan everything

This first step sets everything in motion – in it, you first need to brainstorm all tasks you may have to work on this week, and then work your way down from there.

Once you’re done brainstorming, you’ll likely find that you’ve listed a number of tasks that aren’t a priority or have a distant deadline – scrap these tasks for now, and aim to limit your daily schedules to 3-5 priority tasks per day.

These priorities can be [recurring tasks](https://clockify.me/time-spent-on-recurring-tasks) you tackle every day, like answering important emails or handling client calls. Or, they can be tasks you tackle every-so-often, like handling some urgent administration work, or conducting research for your new project.

Either way, make sure you highlight these priority and unavoidable tasks in your to-do list. You can even add time estimates for each task, to make the next step easier.

![list of tasks with estimates](https://clockify.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/list-of-tasks-with-estimates.png)
Moreover, to make matters easier, you can even parse these tasks into smaller tasks, if possible. For example, instead of allocating 1 hour to the task of “answering emails”, count the number of emails you’ve received that day and allocate 5 minutes to each email. This way, you’ll avoid wasting 10 minutes on one email, and then rushing to finish the next one in 2 minutes (resulting in numerous errors) just to keep up with your impractical time block.

![inbox management as smaller subtasks](https://clockify.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/inbox-management-as-smaller-subtasks.png)
Once you’ve selected your priorities and compiled a comprehensive to-do list, it’s time that you define precise time blocks and mark them in your calendar.

##### 2. Define time blocks

In the second step, time is the main component – you’ll need to decide:

* *When* you need to block time, by defining specific start and end times
* *For how long* you need to block time, by defining the task duration

When answering these questions, bear in mind that there are optimal time periods and duration for each task – you just need to figure them out.

###### When you need to block time

According to the science of circadian rhythms, each activity has an opportune moment – there’s an ideal time for sleeping, eating, relaxing, and working on your priorities. So, unless you have no choice (or find this practice natural for you), you shouldn’t sleep for 8 hours during the day, and then start working on priority tasks at 3 AM.

You likely already have a history of studying or working, so you likely already know when it’s your ideal time for work – the time when you’re the most alert, concentrated, and most likely to focus without distractions. This is the time when you should schedule your priority tasks – schedule other tasks, either business or personal, around this “prime” time, to different time slots.

**Clockify pro tip**  

 Still unsure what your optimal time for productivity is? Check out our guide to the [Best Time Management Techniques](https://clockify.me/time-management-techniques) to learn how to analyze your biological prime time and pinpoint your personal optimal time for priority work.

Alternatively, you can schedule your most important, urgent, or, simply, the most difficult task first thing in the morning – this practice is known as [“eating your frog”](https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/eat-frog-technique/), and it allows you to clear the rest of your daily schedule for more pleasant tasks as soon as possible.

###### For how long you need to block time

According to the science of Ultradian rhythms, peoples’ minds work in 90-minute cycles – and, according to the popular [Pomodoro principle](https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/pomodoro-technique/), you should parse your workday into 25-minute work-time and 5-minute break-time.

What do we get from this?

Well, first, you should never define more than 90 minutes for a time block – science shows you cannot concentrate on one activity without a break for more than an hour and a half in a quality way.

Both the science of Ultradian rhythms and the Pomodoro time management technique insist you take frequent breaks – at least for 5 minutes after each work session. If you find the 90 nonstop minutes for work too much, you can instead choose 25 minutes for your time blocks – this time is long enough for you to fully focus on something, but short enough so that you don’t tire yourself.

**Clockify pro tip**  

 For the ultimate Pomodoro experience, try the Clockify extensions for [Chrome](https://clockify.me/chrome-time-tracking) and [Firefox](https://clockify.me/firefox-time-tracking) – you’ll get [a built-in Pomodoro timer](https://clockify.me/pomodoro-timer) that notifies you when your 25-minute work session is done, and reminds you when it’s time to resume work after your 5-minute break. You can also define custom time for your work sessions and breaks, and include a recurring longer break.

Or, you can combine these two types of prescribed time blocks, depending on the type of tasks you’re working on – 90 minutes for more demanding tasks, and 25 minutes for less demanding tasks.

![25 i 90 minute time blocks](https://clockify.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/25-i-90-minute-time-blocks.png)
These are just some science-based suggestions for your time blocks – you may want to use your own custom time blocks.

Once you’ve decided how you’ll handle your time blocks, simply add them to your calendar.

![blocking stage, the calendar](https://clockify.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blocking-stage-the-calendar.png)
##### 3. Act on your schedule

Once you’ve selected the *what*, and defined the *when* and *for how long*, you’ll need to “act” on your promises and follow your schedule.

Start with your first time block – start working on it at the prescribed start time, and stop working on it at the prescribed end time. Then, repeat, until you reach the end of the schedule for today.

This may seem like the easiest step in the time blocking process – you’ve laid out the ground rules, now you just need to follow them. But, acting on your schedule will only become easy and simple once you figure out whether your prescribed time blocks work in real life – and this is where the revision step kicks in.

##### 4. Test and revise

As you start working on your time blocks, it’s best that you track time on them as you work – this way, you’ll know whether some time blocks are too short or too long, and you’ll be able to revise and perfect them in the future.

For example, you block all your tasks with 25 and 90 minutes, and your time tracking results tell you that this works about 80% of the time – but you also find out that some tasks take much more or less than that.

Perhaps you’ll find that effective meetings typically take 15 minutes and that you waste the other 10 minutes in an effort to live up to your prescribed time block.

![revision stage - too much time allocated](https://clockify.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/revision-stage-too-much-time-allocated.png)
Perhaps you’ll find that you take 2 hours to tackle critical bugs in your program, so your schedule falls half an hour short.

![revision stage - too little time allocated](https://clockify.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/revision-stage-too-little-time-allocated.png)
Either way, you should change your approach- next time you create a schedule, use your real-life time tracking results for each task to define time blocks. With time tracking, you’ll already have proof they work, so you’ll know you’ll finish on schedule.

##### Additional time blocking tips

###### Create time blocking templates

Blocking time in your calendar may take time, but you’ll speed things up if you create time blocking templates – you can create empty time slots with start and end times, and just fill them out with tasks as you are tasked with them.

Reserve empty time slots for your everyday activities – for example, reserve the times when you’ll exercise, take a morning shower, eat breakfast.

You can also reserve empty time slots for your priority tasks – if you’ve calculated your [biological prime time](https://clockify.me/time-management-techniques#time-management-techniques-11), you’ll understand when your most effective time window is, and you’ll know to always reserve these pre-made time slots for your priority tasks.

![time blocking template](https://clockify.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/time-blocking-template.png)
**Clockify pro tip**  

 Want to use ready-made time blocking templates for your tasks instead? We’ve got you covered with our [9 free time blocking templates](https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/time-blocking-planner-templates/) you can download in PDF and then print out, or fill out in Google Sheets.

###### Follow theme days

You can do various tasks during the day, or you can define theme days when you’ll tackle only a certain type of tasks – The CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, [follows this practice](https://clockify.me/daily-routines-habits-productive-people), so he spends entire Tuesdays on product-related activities, and entire Wednesdays on marketing activities.

Following suit, you can block your own days of the week only for specific tasks – for example, block Mondays for meetings and client calls, Tuesdays for research activities, and Wednesdays for administration.

This way, you’ll fully immerse yourself in one type of activity, [avoid multitasking](https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/switch-between-projects-and-tasks/), and make sure you have the tools and materials you need for this type of task.

###### Remain flexible

Sticking to a rigid schedule makes sure you achieve everything on your agenda, but what if something unexpected pops ups?

To prevent surprises that ruin your schedules, make sure you block at least an hour each day for unexpected tasks – if something unexpected happens, you’ll be covered, and if not, you’ll have an additional hour to work on your already scheduled priorities some more.

#### Time blocking apps

Once you’ve understood everything you need to know about time blocking, you’ll need the right “equipment” to make the practice fast and effective – in gist, you’ll need a:

* *Time tracker* to track the time on your activities in real-time, understand how much time you need to finish each task, and define accurate time blocks in your calendar
* *To-do app, task management app, organizer, or planner*, to help you better understand and keep an eye on your priority tasks for today, or any upcoming time period
* *Calendar app*, preferably with deadline and reminder features, to help you plan your time blocks, and make sure you leave yourself time for everything you have to do

#### …In the end, is time blocking the time management technique for you?

In short – yes.

There are several benefits to the time management technique of time blocking, making it a perfect choice for when you’re looking for an easy way to plan and manage your personal and business tasks (and make sure they don’t coincide):

##### It forces you to focus on priorities

When making the initial plan for your time blocks, you’ll feel the urge to block the most amount of quality time for your most important tasks. You’ll also feel the urge to block your early morning slots for tasks that are both important and urgent.

##### It reduces procrastination and distractions

When you have a task scheduled in your calendar, complete with prescribed start and end times, you’ll feel the urge to live up to that prescribed time, or even beat it – so, you’ll be less likely to procrastinate or fall victim to distractions.

##### It makes you realistic about your time and work

Saying you’ll finish a project draft today is an optimistic guess at best unless you have this task written down in your schedule, with the expected time it will take you to finish – and time blocks give you just that.

##### It helps you keep a record of how you spend time

With time blocking, you’re essentially dividing your day into predefined time slots – for example, 1 hour for administration work, 1 hour for answering daily emails, and 3 hours for when you need to craft a project proposal.

As much as the time you block in your calendar serves as your guide for surviving your packed to-do list, it also serves as a reminder of what you’ve accomplished so far, and how much time you’ve spent on certain tasks. This data allows you to rethink your schedule, and whether attending meetings for 4 hours each day prevents you from focusing on other more important matters.

##### It helps you have time for everything

If you’re worried you haven’t been spending enough time with your kids lately, schedule a dedicated time block each day just for them.

If you have an important family dinner sometime soon, block your evening that day for it, and don’t let any excuse stop you from attending.

If you want to work on a creative hobby, schedule an hour each week for it, and stick to this time.

This is one of the biggest perks of this time management technique – you’ll not only reserve and save enough time for your work activities, but you’ll also save time for relaxation, hobbies, family, and friends, or anything you want.

## Full Document
Hi, I'm Paul, and in today's video, we'regoing to explore the modal contextprotocol within Obsidian. We'll explorehow to automate your note generationusing an open-source MCP server and Claudedesktop. If you're an Obsidian userlooking to experiment with AI tools,this video is for you. Join me as weautomate note creation in Obsidian withAI. The modal context protocol overview. Intoday's video, we're going to becovering the modal context protocol.MCP will allow us to use Claudedesktop to automate our note creationinside Obsidian. We're going to dothis with some AI prompts. So, how doesthis work? Well, we use a free MCPclient called Claude Desktop, and weconnect that to some free open-sourceMCP server tools. These MCP serversfor Obsidian give us the functionalityto use tools such as search, list files,vault management, delete files, get filecontents, patch content, and appendcontent. This is all done throughconnecting our Obsidian Vault with aREST API. Today's video will covertwo options for setting this upwith your Obsidian Vault. Option onewill be an advanced setup, and this isGoing to install the MCP server for Obsidianusing Python Claw Desktop and the

REST API Community Plugin. We'll alsorun through option two, MCP Tools, whichis an easy setup and this only requiresClaw Desktop REST API Community Pluginand MCP Tools Community Plugin. So, I'llstart off with a showcase of some usecases on what functionality this cangive you within Obsidian and then we'llmove on to setting up our advanced setupand our easy setup MCP server use caseexamples. Here I am inside of Obsidian,and I've created an AI research vaultwith some automated note generationprompts. If I have a look over to theleft, I have my MCP server installed. IfI jump into community plugins, I've alsoinstalled MCP Tools and you can see thatI've got the MCP server installed hereas well. If I go ahead and open up ClawDesktop, I can see that I've got 30 MCPtools available to me. And if Ileft-click, I can see all the MCP toolsthat are now available to Claude. Theseare going to allow me to interactwith my vault. So we can see here we'vegot list vault files, append content,and delete files. If I click this attachfrom MCP, I can navigate down and see myI installed MCP servers. So I've got myGitHub MCP Obsidian Option One server.

Then I have my Obsidian MCP Tools Option Two server. If I go up to File and chooseSettings and come down to Developer, Ican see the two servers are running hereand we can see the arguments thatthey're using. I can go and edit theconfig, but I don't needto. So, I'm going to come into Obsidianand copy my prompt here and go back toClaw Desktop and paste that prompt. Theprompt is, "I would like to bemotivated today. Can you create aninspirational folder in my vault toinspire me to keep going? Because I'mfeeling a little bit uninspired today.

So, let's go ask Claude 3.7 Sonnet tointeract with my Obsidian vault. Now,you'll see this prompt asking to allowaccess to Obsidian. So, I'm just goingto select allow. Now, I'm not doing thison my main Obsidian vault because it ismaking changes and it can read my vault.So, that's why I've set up an AIresearch vault in order to run theseexamples. So, you can see that Claude isgoing and creating an inspiration dailyaffirmations note in MySpaces folder.It's also created motivational quotes.

Note in MySpaces folder. It's nowcreating a goaltracker. It's using the create vaultfile tool to create a personal winsmarkdown note.And finally, it's created a visualinspiration note for inspirationalimages that I can collect and add. Goingto select allowagain. So now it's going to give me asummary of everything that it has donefor me. So it's created a comprehensiveinspirational folder with severalmotivational resources. I can see I havedaily affirmations, motivational quotes,goal tracker, personal wins, inspirationfor tough days, and visual inspiration.

It's placed it in my spaces directory,and it's ready for me to customize. So,let's go have a look inside my spacesfolder and see I've got now a foldercalled inspiration. If I click on thefirst note, daily affirmations, I can seethat I have a few daily affirmationshere that I can run through for strength,perseverance, productivity andfocus, self-worth, and confidence. So,these could be quite useful for dailyaffirmations. There's a little exampleof a goal tracker. I don't know if thatWould it be useful or not? But it's quitenice that it created that for me.

There's a note about inspiration fortough days because we all face difficultmoments, and this is going to be anemergency toolkit. So, this could bequite a nice note to customize and use.

Motivational quotes. So, I could gothrough these and see if I like any ofthese quotes. I could reformat them. So,I quite like this one. The way to getstarted is to quit talking and begindoing. The future depends on what you dotoday on taking action. So, there are quitea few nice quotes in there that I canread through.

Let’s have a look at thepersonal wins. Okay. So that’s just afew heading twos with some examples ofwins, achievements, and personal growthmoments. So, this could be good for areflection or journal.And then it hasn’t downloaded any photos for myvisual inspiration page, but it’s justgiving me an example of how this mightbe laid out. Okay, so that’s been quiteinteresting.

So let’s go back to our automated notegeneration prompt and let’s do our nextexample, which is a book research ofAtomic Habits.

Copy this prompt that I've alreadyprecreated. Come back into my clawdesktop. I might just start a new chat andpaste in the next prompt. And the nextprompt is, "Can you create a researchfolder called Atomic Habits and add allthe best ideas and tools from the book?"I need to allow it. Again, I've also gota note there to make sure each note hasvalid YAML and links back to an index ormap of content. So, I'm just going tomonitor what it's doing and accept anyrequests to make changes to my AIresearch vault. So this time it'screating the folder Atomic Habits insidemy spaces folder. Now I might not

want it to be in that location, but atleast I know where it's been created, soI can always review it after the processhas been completed. So we'll go aheadand speed up the video just so that wecan skip forward a littlebit. So this one's taking a little bitlonger than the first one. And it'sprobably been about 10 minutes so far.And I've just got a message from Claudeto say Claude hit the max length for themessage and has paused its response. SoI can hit continue to keep going or Ican just stop where it is.

Have a look to see what it's done sofar. So if I head up to spaces, I cansee I've got a folder called AtomicHabits with the number nine. So there arenine notes. I have my map of content inhere. I might want to move that upto my map of content. Then I can seethat it's linking to all the other notesthat it's created here. So, we've gotfour laws of behavior change: Q,craving, response, reward. We've gotidentity-based habits: outcome, process,identity. There's a bit of informationin there. We've got one about habitstacking, environmental design, plateauof latent potential, and the two-minute rule.

When we start a new habit, it shouldtake less than two minutes to do it. Andwe've also got a habit scorecard andimplementation intentions. So, I've gotquite a lot of information there. Asthis is a demonstration, I'm not goingto continue making more notes, butI'm pretty happy with what's beingcreated sofar. So, I'm just going to go copy mytopic example here. I'm going to justmake a new chat, and I'm going to pastein my topic example, and this one's goingto be: Can you create a research folder?

Called AI, and add markdown notes aboutthe impact of artificial intelligence onthe future of education. Ensure thatnotes follow strict YAML tag andObsidian markdown structure. And I mightchange tag to tags. I'm just going tohit enter on that one.

So Claude's going to ask me to create the AI folder withthe Obsidian list files. So I'll sayallow. Once again, it's put it in myspaces folder under research. Then asubfolder AI. It wants to create filesnow. So I'm going to say yes. Go createsome files. I don't really know why it'sputting numbering before markdownnotes besides the fact that I've gotnumbering on my six folders here. So,I'm thinking it's trying to mimic mystarter kit. I could probably tell it tonot do that. I'll just let it go fornow.

So, you can see it's mostly usingthe Obsidian MCP tools in order tocreate thesefiles. It's taking about 5 to 10 minutesto create my AI research structure. So,it's telling me that it's got a map ofcontent and five detailed topic notes.

So, let's go have a look in the spacesresearch AI folder. I can see six notes.

In there, I've got a map of contentas the first note, and then it's simplyjust linking through to all the othernotes that it's created. So, we'll havea look at the first one: AI andeducation. It just mentions that it'sincreasingly being integrated intoeducational environments, keytransformation areas, and some researchstatistics, and then some links to theother notes that it's created here. So,we've got personalized learning, AIsystems, case studies, AI assessmenttools, ethicalconsiderations, and future classroommodels. It even provided us with an

implementation timeline here. So, thismay or may not be useful to me. I guessit's interesting to see what the AIcreates with MCPtools. So, I'm just going to copy theprompt here, jump into Claude, create anew chat, and paste in my prompt. Can youcreate a minimalistic Obsidian Bolt withminimalistic templates using valid YAMLand tags? Create it in a new foldercalled minimalistic bolt and ensure thateach node has valid YAML and followsObsidian's best practices. So, we'll hitenter on that one.

It's not going to delete any of myfolders, and it just gives me anotherconcept vault to look at. Now, thismight be useful if you just have anempty vault, and you’ve connected up MCPtools, and you just want to create avault structure to start with. So, wecan see it's created the folder here,minimalistic vault. Now, it's going tocreate the essential templates. So,we've got one here for our daily note.Got a project template, a referencetemplate. You see that it's putting YAMLin there when the file was created. Andthere's some templated syntax in thereas well. So it's actually writing thetemplated code for us, which ishandy. Okay, so now it's going to gocreate some sample notes based on what

it'screated. Oh, so now it's going to gocreate an Obsidian folder inside of myvault with anapp.json file with some settings. Andit's also doing my appearance settingsand core plugins. Okay, so it's actuallythinking that it needs to create a wholenew Obsidian Vault for me. This is veryinteresting. Now, it's doing my hotkeys.I think one of the challenging thingsWith this tool, it’s kind of hard tointerject whilst the AI is automating mynotes. And I have to wait a little bitof time between prompts as well. So, I’mlooking at, you know, 5 to 10 minutesevery time I ask Claude to do something.

So, unless I’m really specific with myprompts, it might not give me the outputthat I want, but I can always revise andchange it later. But depending on howmuch time I want to spend waiting forClaude to automate everything and thengo back, review, and summarize, itcould be a bit of a waste of time.If I already had the information with asmuch detail as possible, that could saveme a lot of time.

Okay, so we can see here that my minimalistic vault is setup. So, let’s go have a look.We’ve got some templates. We’ve got a dailynote template. Well, that’s interesting.It’s even put emojis in there for me.Got a meeting template, projecttemplate, reference. There are some YAMLproperties here, too, which is nice.That’s what I asked for. Let’s actuallyadd some YAML properties in there. Ihad a look at the sourcecode. They’re just static dates. So,they’re not actually template snippets.

So, it's not going to be a dynamictemplate. I also don't like this. What'sunder here? I've got an example ofdaily. Okay. So, it's done. Here's how it looksif you do a daily journal. An inboxquick capture website redesign. Okay. So,this is an example of a project page,and then some references. Okay, interesting.And a readme page explaining what it'screated. Okay, well that wasinteresting, I guess. So I guess youknow if you give the AI enoughinformation, then it could come upwith some interesting automations here.So, I encourage you to experiment withMCP tools on a second Obsidian Boltthat's not your main Obsidian Vault, andsee whether you can find a good use casefor this new technology. How to set upMCP server for Obsidian. Option one isgoing to be MCP server for Obsidian. Andthis is using Marcus Funstein's MCP

server for Obsidian. And this MCP serverallows you to interact with Obsidian viathe Obsidian REST API. And this is goingto be an advanced setup. So we need todo a few steps here in order to get itworking. So the first thing we need todo is head over topython.org/downloads and select theDownload Python. Your version may varycompared to mine. Once you've downloadedthe installer, double click to installit and select install now. That will goinstall Python on your computer. Whilethat's running and installing, you canhead over todocs.astral.sh/uv and head up toinstallation and I want you to copy thisPowerShell script here. And then wesimply just open up PowerShell on ourcomputer and paste the command. Hit theenter key and that will go install UV.

Now we need to take note of this installlocation as we'll need to add it to ourconfig later. So, just go ahead,highlight and copy and paste that to anotepad. Now, this is optional, but youcan download and install my free startervault, or I'd recommend just using aempty vault to set this up because it isgoing to have access to your Obsidianfiles and be able to make changes toyour vault. So, it's best to do it in atesting environment first. I'll justselect get now and go download thestarter vault. Whilst I've gone and donethat, I can see that my Python setup wassuccessful. So I'll just close this.Then I'm going to extract my starterVault pro to the location that I want tocreate my Obsidian vault. You can seehere I've put it in my D drive underdemo vaults. I'm just going to renamethis to AI research vault. So now I need

to open this up in Obsidian. So go aheadand open Obsidian. So just select openand navigate to where you placed thatstarter kit. If you want to create a newvault, just select create. I've alreadyopened it. So I'm going to select AIresearch vault. So here's my vault thatI'm going to install MCP server on. Sonow I need to go get MCP server. So I'mgoing to head over to Marcus Funstein'sGitHub, and this will be MCP server forObsidian. Now there are a couple ways youcan do it. You can head up to code,download the zip, and place it in yourvault. Or what I like to do is just copythe command here and pull it down fromGitHub. So I'm going to go do that andI'm going to jump into PowerShell. Andthen I'm going to navigate to the vaultlocation. So the easiest way to do thatis to hold shift, right-click, and copy its path.

And then come back into PowerShell and changedirectory space. Right-click the mouse.And that's going to change to my demoVault AI research folder. Now, what I wantto do is come back over tohere and copy this command, the copy URL,to my clipboard. Go back into PowerShell,get clone, space, paste. Enter. That’sgoing to pull down the MCP servercalled MCP Obsidian to my AI researchvault. So, I can do a dir to list thedirectory, and I can see it’s listedhere. If I minimize and go into my file

explorer into my AI research vault, Ican see it’s here as well. And thenthere are all the files. If we jump intoObsidian, we can see that we have ourMCP server here. Now, you don’t need toplace it in the Obsidian vault, but Ijust like to place it in there just so Iknow where it is. You could put it inyour toolkit if you wanted to. I’ll justleave it here for the demo. And thenwhat I’m going to do is install Claude. So, head over toclaude.ai/download and install Claude.

So now that we’ve got Claude installed,head back into Obsidian, go down to yoursettings, head up to community plugins,select browse, type in REST, and selectthe local REST API. Go ahead and installand enable the local REST API. Jumpstraight into the options and copy yourAPI key and just go and paste that intoa notepad as well. So now we're ready toconnect Claude to Obsidian. So go clickstart and launch Claude. Now you'llnotice nothing happens, and that’sbecause we haven't set up theconfiguration yet. So to do that, whatwe're going to do is close Claude. Nownotice on the taskbar here, Claude isstill running. So we need to right-click

and close it here as well. And then whatI want to do is I want to head back overto the GitHub, and I want to scrolldown, and we can see here that we've gotour configuration that we need to add toClaude. So where do we find thatconfiguration? Well, there are a coupleways of getting to it. We can navigatedirectly to it here on Windows. So we canhighlight, Ctrl C to copy, then Windowskey R, paste, and hit okay. And that isgoing to open up our Claude desktopconfiguration. You can see it’scurrently empty. Now I'm using VisualStudio Code, but you can use any codeeditor or notepad that you would like.

So another option you can do is insideof Claude, with Claude open, we can comeup to the top here, and we can go underfile, then over to settings, clickDeveloper, select Edit Config, andthat’s going to show the config filehere. And then we can right-click andopen it in our editor, so whatever'squickest for you. Then, we need toadd our configuration. If I have alook here and scroll up, here’s theconfiguration that we need to add. So,I’m just going to copy this and then goback to our configuration and paste itin. Now, we need to make a few changeshere. We need to specify where weinstalled UVX, add somearguments, and include our

Obsidian environment API key. This isgoing to be from our local REST APIplugin. To save time, I’m just goingto paste it in, and then I’ll go throughit with you. The command that I’musing is my C users, the name of my userfolder, .lo bin where UV has beeninstalled. Then, I’m placing my ObsidianAPI key. I can double-check that bygoing here and copying it, then goingback into my code editor and making sureit’s the correct one. I’ve got somearguments here. I’ve got the locationof my directory, which is listed here, andit’s pointing to MCP Obsidian. Thatwill be different for you as well.

If you're not sure, you can just holdShift, right-click, and copy as path. Andthen when you paste that in, it'll showyou your path there. Now, notice howI've got forward slashes, notbackslashes. So, it's important to havea forward slash there. Now, I'll leavethis in the video description so you canmake changes to it as you would like.Make sure you hit save on that. So, nowwe've got our config file set up forClaude. So, what we want to do is closeClaude. Come down and force close itfrom our taskbar. Go ahead and launchClaude again. This time what shouldhappen is we should see a tool iconappear with our 12 MCP tools available.

And then inside there we can see all ouravailable MCP tools. We can also attachfrom MCP and see our MCP Obsidian MCPserver installed. So we're ready to go.I'll just copy and paste a prompt here.I'm researching MCP server for Obsidian.Can you create a research folder withthe relevant markdown notes about thistopic? Ensure that each note has validYAML and follows Obsidian's bestpractices. And we'll just hit enter onthat. So, I need to allow this in orderfor MCP to access my vault. I'm justGoing to hit allow. Now, it's alreadydetected my MCP folder. So, it's justgoing to scan through that folder andsee what I've got in there. So, it'signoring that folder, and it's going tocreate another folder called MCPserver research. We can see here thatit's created MCP overview. So this isgoing to take a few minutes to runthrough. I can see that it's alreadycreated that folder up the top here. Sowe'll just let it run its path, and we'llreview what Claude has done aftereverything completes. So it's probably taken aboutfive minutes to do that research for me,

and it's only created five markdownfiles in my vault. We can see that wehave an overview, installation setup,core functionality, API reference, andPython client information. So, I canjust review all these markdown notes andsee if they are useful to me. How to setup MCP tools in Obsidian. Let's go setup option two, MCP tools, easy setup onour Windows PC. This is alsoavailable to the public on GitHub. So ifyou want to go check out the sourcecode, you can have a look at it here. Sothe first thing to do is to go toGo to claude.ai/d to download and select Windowsand install the application. I'm goingto use the Obsidian Starter Vault for freeas my testing vault. Extract thecontents of the Obsidian Starter Vaultand change the name to what you would like to name the vault. I'llcall this one the AI research vault. Then wewant to go and open our new vault fromObsidian. You can open a folder as a vaultby selecting this option. If you'vealready opened it previously, then youcan select it on the left-hand side.

Next, navigate down to settings, goup to community plugins, select browse,do a search for REST, and select thelocal REST API. Go ahead and install andenable the local REST API. We'll jumpinto the options and we're going to copyour API key, which will be unique toyour device. So just go and copy andpaste that into a notepad. Head back upto community plugins. Select browse anddo a search for MCP tools by Jack Steam.

You can see a link here to theGitHub repository. This willallow us to securely connect Claudedesktop to our vault with searchtemplates and file managementcapabilities. So we'll go ahead andSelect "Install" and we need to enable MCPtools, then jump into the options.

Now we can see here that the MCP server isnot installed, even though we'veinstalled the plugin. So we need to goahead and select "Install Server." We cansee at the top right that it’sdownloading the MCP server from theGitHub repository. There are a fewdependencies here. So you can see thatit’s already installed the local RESTAPI and the Templator. I don’t have smartconnections installed, and that one isoptional. So it will show me what theversion is at the top there, and at thetime of recording, it is MCP server

version0.2.22. I can click on the server installfolder, and I can see that this pluginplaces an MCP tax server.exe file inmy Obsidian plugins MCP tools folder. Nowif you don’t like these sorts ofapplications being installed on yourcomputer, then go with the advancedoption that we covered earlier. So nowwe have our vault set up. Let’s go openup Claude. So select "Start" and thenselect Claude. Now we can see here thatClaude has detected 18 MCP tools available.

We can click and see all the types ofTools that are available with thiscommunity plugin. So, I can scroll downand see all the available tools. I canalso select "Attach from MCP" and have alook to see that my Obsidian MCP toolsare installed. So now I can startinteracting with my vault. So, I'll justgo ahead and use the same prompt that Iused in my showcase, and that will be: Iwould like to be motivated today. Canyou create me an inspirational folder inmy vault to inspire me to keep going?

And I'm going to submit. So, I need toallow this to run. Therefore, I need to selectallow for this chat. This will enableClaude to go and build this for mein my Obsidian vault. We can see onthe left-hand side here that it'salready created a folder called"Inspiration." Now, this will take alittle bit of time to complete. So, justbepatient. As I've already covered this inthe showcase, I'll just skip ahead tosave time in the video.

So, we can see that our "Inspiration Room"folder has been created successfully, andClaude is telling us the six things thatit's created. Then we can go see inour vault here that we have our dailyAffirmations, our goal-setting guide,inspirational dashboard, motivationalquotes, personal wins, and successstories. Now, I like to use an emptyvault in order to use MCP tools. Then Ican just take the best snippets from theautomation and put them into my mainvault. It's totally up to you if you want toconnect your main vault or not. But justremember that MCP tools can read andmanipulate markdown files in your vault.

And there you have it. How to automatenote generation inside Obsidian with MCPservers and Claw Desktop. I hope you'veenjoyed the video and are excited to trythese tools out for yourself. If youhave been experimenting with MCP toolsin other ways, please share yourthoughts and experiences in the commentsbelow. Thanks for watching, and I'll seeyou in the next video.

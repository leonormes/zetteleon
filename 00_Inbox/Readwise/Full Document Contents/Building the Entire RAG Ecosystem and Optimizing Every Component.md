Most teams, when creating a production-ready RAG system on their data, go through many rounds of experimentation and rely on several different components, each requiring its own setup, tuning, and careful handling. These components include…

1. **Query Transformations:** Rewriting user questions to be more effective for retrieval.
2. **Intelligent Routing:** Directing a query to the correct data source or a specialized tool.
3. **Indexing:** Creating a multi-layered knowledge base.
4. **Retrieval and Re-ranking:** Filtering noise and prioritizing the most relevant context.
5. **Self-Correcting Agentic Flows:** Building systems that can grade and improve their own work.
6. **End-to-End Evaluation:** Objectively measuring the performance of the entire pipeline.

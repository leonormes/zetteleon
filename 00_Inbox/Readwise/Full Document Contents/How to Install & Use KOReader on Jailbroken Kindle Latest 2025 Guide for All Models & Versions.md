Hello everyone! So today I'm going to show you how you can install KOReader onyour jailbroken Kindle. We all know that the biggest benefit of jailbreaking aKindle is the ability to install KOReader because it has a lot of features,especially when you are reading PDF files. First of all, I'm going to plugthis Kindle into my computer, just likethis. Okay, now that it is plugged in, I'm going to go to my computerscreen. As you can see, this is the official website of KOReader, so they havedifferent distributions for different devices. If you click download, then itwill take you to the GitHub repository of KOReader. From there, you can downloadthe latest versions of KOReader, but the problem with the latestversion is that, uh, since the jailbreak has just become available, it is not yetsupported for the latest jailbrokenKindles. That's why you have to use another version of KOReader, which I willlink in the description below. So that is the nightly build, Imean a slightly older version of KOReader, but the process will be the same.

In the future, when the latest version of KOReader supports the latest jailbrokenKindles, then you can just download from here. So I'm going to show you how youcan download it. For example, let's say these are all the releases fordifferent devices. For the Kindle, there are two versions: one isKindle Legacy, and another is Kindle. What you have to do is you have to justclick on it and then download the zip file.Just like this. I'm not going to installthis version; I have another version downloaded on my computeralready, which I have extracted in thisfolder. As you can see, these are the two folders that are required toinstall KOReader on your Kindle.So what I'm going to do is I'm going to open a new tab on my file manager andthen open the Kindle directory because my Kindle is already connected.It will show the Kindle rootdirectory, and I will just copy these two folderswhich I have downloaded and extracted from the zip.

File and then paste it into the Kindle'sroot directory just like this. Since this is a pretty big file, I mean, 97 megabytes, it will take some time toinstall. My Kindle is using a micro USB port for data transfer; that's why it's abit slow. But in your case, your Kindle might use a Type-C port; in that case, thedata transfer rate will be faster. So I'm going to wait for thecopying process to be finished. [Music]Remember again, for now, you cannotinstall the latest version of the KOReaderfrom the GitHub repository because it will not work on your Kindleuntil the developers fix that problem. So until then, you have to use the nightlybuild, which I will provide the link inthe description below. The process is allthe same, and in the future, if you want to update

your KOReader, in that case, you canjust download the updated files and then replace them just like this. The process willbe all the same. [Music]It is almost done. Okay, so the copy process has beendone now. I'm going to unplug the Kindle from my[Music] computer, okay, just likethis. If we go to the home of theKindle, then we have to openKUAL, and then we can see that there isKOReader added into our list. So we click in here, and then wewill click on Start.

As you can see at the bottom, itsays "Starting KOReader," that means the KOReader hasstarted already. So this is the quickstart guide of KOReader, and it will give you a quick overview of how you canuse the KOReader. I'm going to skipthis and go to the file browser. So thisis the file browser of the Kindle. From here, you can browse yourbook files and then open.

This is the home button of KOReader. You can go to theKOReader's home, and then you can see the documents folder. Inside these, you canKeep any files, and then you can read. You can keep files in other folders too.

Unlike Kindle's default UI, I'm going to show you how you can exit the KOReader.So, for this, you have to touch anywhere at the top header, and then you will seethat this is the KOReader menu. From here, you can go to KOReader settingsand other options, and from here, you will see that there's an exit option. So youhave to click on exit, and then there is an option torestart KOReader, then sleep mode, and then exit. So if you click[Music], exit it will take you to the homepage ofyour Kindle. I mean the defaultUI. Okay, so we have already come back to the default UI ofKindle. From here, I'm going to go to home. So as you can see, even afterinstalling KOReader, things are all the same. You can use your Kindle as always,you can read PDF books, ePub, KFX, or anything in your default UI. But if youwant extra functionality, only then can you launch the KOReader, or you canalways be inside the KOReader if you prefer that more.

I'm going to plug in the USB cable to load a PDF file to show you how itlooks on KOReader. Now that the USB isconnected, I'm going to go to my PC.[Music] And this is my Kindle'sdirectory, and I have a test PDF here, so I'm going to move this tothe downloads folder. In here, you can put this anywhere, so I'm going to paste thisinside the downloads folder, inside the documents folder ofKindle. So, it will take some time to load the PDF.

Okay, now that it is done, I'm going to unplug myKindle. Okay, now as you can see, this is the default reader, and if we open the PDF inhere, it looks like this. It does not have much functionality inhere, so reading PDF in Kindle is not always convenient. But after we jailbreakand install KOReader, reading is much more easier. So what we have to do is wehave to go to KUAL and then go toKOReader, and then start KOReader. Now it will start KOReader.

Just wait for it to start, and then this is the home page of KOReader, as you cansee. All the directories are here, so you go to your documents because we have putthe PDF in the downloads folder inside the documents folder. So this is the PDF fileas you can see, it is showing all the metadata. So we will click on it, and it'sopening. So this is the KOReader, as you cansee. I can clearly see that the KOReader is faster than the default PDFreader onKindle. There are various options; for example, we can go to the settings ofKOReader. Then here you can change contrast, font size, and whether Reflow is on or off.

Right now, the Reflow is off, and if we turn on PDF Reflow, it will looklike an EPUB book. It is easier to read, and everything is very[Music] nice. There are a lot of features in theKOReader. I'm going to create another video to show you all the features. If you wantto keep your Kindle like this and then go to sleep, for example, I'm going tolock my Kindle, and then it will show that it'ssleeping. So right now, it's in sleep mode, and it will preserve the battery. Itwill preserve the state; you don't needto exit KOReader. When youunlock the Kindle, you can start reading from here. I mean, if you use KOReaderregularly, then you don’t need toexit KOReader any time. You can just launch directly from KOReader. But if you want to go back to thedefault UI, then you can exit KOReader just like I showed you earlier.[Music] You just click in here and then click on exit, and it will exit to the defaultUI. So that's it for now. Thank you very much. [Music]

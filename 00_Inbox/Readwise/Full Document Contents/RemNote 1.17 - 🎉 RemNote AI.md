## Full Document
Hey, Martin here! Today we're excited toannounce RemNote 1.17 with RemNote AI tomake your learning more efficient,effective, and fun. We've added AIflashcard generation, AI tutor chat, imageto text conversion, flashcard insights, AIgrading, multiple choice explanations, andeven more! Let's jump right into it. First,you can now AI-generate flashcardsdirectly from any text, PDF, or web page.

First, go to a document in RemNote andpaste in some text. After pasting it in,drag your mouse to select the text thatyou want to generate cards from, andpress the new "Create AI Cards" button onthe popup. Here, you'll see that the cardsimmediately appear on your screen.They're displayed in the same format asin the editor, where each bullet isits own flashcard. Individual cards canbe enabled or disabled by checking thisbox, and you can customize them in avariety of ways. First, you can choosewhat kind of cards you want:Questions, which are the single-line ones,like this; multi-line, which go ontomultiple lines; cloze, which are fill inthe blanks, like this one here;definitions, such as the definition ofmitochondria; and descriptors, which areThese two quick questions are asking you forexample, what the purpose of themitochondria is. If, for example, you onlywant the clothes to fill in the blanks, youcan just go and uncheck the others hereand you'll see that the system

automatically starts generating newflashcards for you, letting you watch asthey're written in real time. Let'sreenable the different types here andthen make another adjustment with thebox down here. I can specify any changeor any focus style, etc., that I want justby typing it in. For example, maybe I wantthe cards to be more technical andspecific. If I press adjust cards here,they will automatically be rewrittenwith the style or focus that I want. Whenyou're done, you can save the cards andthey will appear immediately in youreditor. These are just normal Rflashcards, so you can go ahead anddelete ones that you decide you nolonger want, edit them, customize them, andreally make them yours. We viewgenerated flashcards as a reallyefficient way to generate a first draftof your cards, but do make sure that youread through them and adjust anylanguage that you dislike or try to add.

More connections to other ideas in yourhead. You can also generate cardsdirectly from PDFs and web pages. For aPDF, go to "Create" and then upload yourPDF. Once uploaded, you can go to anysection that you want to generate cardsfrom. Select the text in there and againjust press the "Create AI Cards" buttonwithin your PDF to generate cards. Fromweb pages, first search for and installthe RemNote Clipper, and then open it onany page. After you open the Clipper sidepanel, you can then just select text onany web page itself and press the "AIGenerate Cards" button. You'll then beable to generate cards directly in RemNotehere, in the same way. Now, what if yougenerate a card but don't fullyunderstand the idea behind it? Or what ifyou're learning something and want todrill down deeper into the idea? For that,we've added an AI tutor chat directly inRemNote. The tutor can see your currentbullet and flash card to help youquickly ask questions about them. For

example, let's say that I want to learnmore about how the mitochondria usesaerobic respiration. Here, you can nowjust type "slash explain" on any bullet,and the chat on the right willAutomatically, open and begin explainingthe idea. Here you'll see that weautomatically include formulas, diagrams,and images, and then you can immediatelybegin asking questions about it. Forexample, I could drill down into askingwhat ATP is, or I could use one of theautomatically suggested questions andjust click on one of those directly. Youcan type very informally with the chathere because it has the context of youreditor. For example, if I click on aerobicrespiration here, you can see that thatcontext is automatically beingprovided to the tutor. So if I just askit what or explain something, thenyou can see that it automaticallyunderstands what I'm talking about.

There's no need to switch betweendifferent tools and risk potentiallylosing your flow or getting distracted.

For any message, you can then click onany term that you want to understand ata deeper level. If I click glucose here,I'll see an explanation, an image of it,mnemonics, including analogy and acatchy phrase to help me remember it, aswell as a link to the full Wikipedia orAmboss article. Additionally, I can goand generate flashcards directly forAny response just by pressing the makeflashcards button once flashcards aregenerated. I can save them to my notes inone click, and I'll both see them on thenotes document on the left as well as Ican edit them directly in the AI chat.

Here, the AI tutor also automaticallyappears while practicing flashcards. Ifyou ever need help or have a question,just press the AI tutor button. Here, thetutor again automatically has context ofthe card that you’re on. You can just askit to explain or ask it any morespecific questions than you have. Deeplyunderstanding what you’re learning isthe foundation of any effective spacedrepetition practice, and being able toimmediately drill down into anyconfusions has been really useful in ourtesting. Next, we've added the ability toAI convert images to text in one click.If you go to any document and paste inan image, you can now go to the buttonhere and then press AI convert to text.After just a moment, you'll see that thetext streams in and then appearsunderneath the image in your document. Itautomatically will have headerformatting, indentation, and everythingthat you need to immediately then use.

These in your notes can even immediatelygenerate cards from them again just bydragging to select and then pressing createAI cards here. Once the cards are ready,you can just save them directly to yournotes, and they'll go right underneathyour image. This should work forhandwritten notes, pictures ofblackboards, and even math. If Ipaste in this math here and convert it,you can see we automatically get nicelyformatted math expressions of Basetheorem here. We've added a newversion of the AI image occlusion thatshould be significantly more accurate. Ifyou paste in an image that has labels

like this that you want to test yourselfon, you can just go to the top right andpress generate cards with AI. You'll seethat the new boxes should perfectlyselect out each individual label, ignoringany titles at the top or copyright stufflike this, and the text is automaticallybeing transcribed and saved to the imagein the background. For example, if Isearch for the aorta, you'll see thatthis image is appearing here inthe search and opening back up when Isearch for that word. We've alsointegrated this with a new and improved.

The AI grading system on your flashcardsallows you to enable the AI grading featurewhile practicing.You can find this option in the three-dot menu in the top right.By checking this box, you can enable itfor any individual card, or for the entiredocument or folder. After enabling,you can now type in your answer. For example,if you type "the superior vena," it willautomatically grade you against thewords that are either in the image or inthe text. If you get it wrong, for example,if you say that this here is the aorta,you'll receive automatic feedback fromthe AI tutor, telling you about what thecorrect parts are, as well as what theincorrect parts are, and how you can maybedifferentiate or resolve any confusions.

We've also added AI voice typing. You can goclick on the microphone icon on the rightand speak your answer.You can see that it's automaticallytranscribing what I say. If I say theword "done," it will automatically submitmy answer and then grade it with the AIfeedback. In this case, I didn't actuallyanswer the question, so it's explainingthe answer to me, as well as explainingwhat that idea is so that I can help.

To understand it at a deeper level, I canjust say the word "done" here, and weautomatically go to the next card andthen just keep on learning. If you want,you can also enable the text-to-speechfeature here to have it automaticallyread out cards to you, and then you canjust speak them back for a totallyhands-free experience. For now, the voicetyping only works in Google Chrome, butwe're hoping to bring it everywhere soon.

Even if you're not using typing, answeringor the AI grading here, it's often veryuseful to see broader context on theback of your flashcards. We've added anew feature called "flashcard insights"that automatically provides youinformation and insights into your flashcard. For example, if we go topractice this question here, then once wereveal the answer, we'll automaticallysee some explanations on the back forwhy this idea is true, as well as someproduct context. If you want to drilldown further into any of those ideas, youcan then just again open the AI chattutor on the right, and it willimmediately begin explaining the idea toyou and give you an opportunity to askany more specific questions.

A few different kinds of flashcard insightsfor dates. We've added an automatictimeline that shows you the surroundingcontext of events before and after theone that's on your card. Insights areautomatically selected based on what'smost useful. So for dates, you'll see thehistorical timeline, and then in thiscase, some broader context about WorldWar II. If you have a list, we'll show youa mnemonic acronym to help you rememberthe list more easily.

For multiple choicecards, we will automatically show the flashcard insights on the back of thecorresponding answer that you choose. Ifyou get it wrong, we will explain why andtell you what the right answer is. Ifyou get it right, we will drill down intothe right answer in even more detail.

Again, if you're confused, you can ask afollow-up question right with thisbutton here, and we'll automatically havecontext for the card that you're talkingabout. We've also made a number ofimprovements to the tab completionfeature for writing flashcards. First,the tab completion feature can now seethe part of any PDF that's visible onyour screen. For example, this paper hereWhich is a specific machine learningsystem that they designed. If we ask itwhat is a giraffe, we'll see that we get aresponse that's specific to this context,pulling text directly from the paperrather than talking more generally orabstractly about a giraffe. The tabcompletion should also be even fasterand more reliable than in the past. Itstill works with all single line,

multi-line, and multiple choice cards. AllPro users have 1,000 AI credits permonth to use these AI features. We'vealso added an extra Pro Plus AI planthat has 20,000 AI credits per month forusers who want to use the AI cardcreation, chat, grading, etc., at even higherlevels. You can upgrade to this plan inone click directly in RemNote, and itautomatically uses all of our differentAI providers, which use a mix of powerfulas well as optimized models. We'vedesigned these features to be asoptimized as possible so that we cangive you as many credits and uses as wecan. Many of the features, especially theAI card creation, though, are quite hungryin terms of credits because we want theoutput cards to be really good.

The month should be effectively unlimited for any reasonable use, and we'recurrently providing the credits to youat the same cost as our underlying AIproviders without us adding any extracharge on top. Finally, we've added a tonof other improvements and smallpolish since our 1.16 release. We've addedthe new insight popup, whichautomatically underlines technical wordsin your editor and lets youimmediately see the explanation, animmonics, and Wikipedia and Amboss for them.

We've built out a totally new all notespage, which has a timeline view, full pagesearch, and easier manipulation. We'vereleased the new RemNote Clipper, whichlets you easily capture notes and writeyour own notes on web pages, as well asgenerate those cards. We've added a newcard clustering feature, which lets youcreate cards that are tested togetherin your queue. For example, if I havethese cards here, I can just type SLcluster on the bullet under whichthey're indented. If I then go topractice them, you can see that all fourof the bullets are going to be testedhere together, and after I review oneThe prior cards before it, which remainon my screen, work with forwardand backward multiline close cards, all thedifferent card types. If you indentthem, that will work as well. We've alsoreleased a new fast desktop updater, atotal redesign of settings, and justthousands of other small improvements,bug fixes, and performance enhancements.

We're very excited about these new AIfeatures to accelerate your learning, butour number one priority does remainkeeping RemNote fast, polished, andstable. We're excited to see how you usethis first batch of RemNote AI features.Please send us your feedback and happylearning.

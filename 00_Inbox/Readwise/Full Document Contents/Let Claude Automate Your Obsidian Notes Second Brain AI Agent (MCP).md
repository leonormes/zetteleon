## Full Document
Today, I'll show you how you can connectClaude and Obsidian together to takeyour thinking to the next level. Watchhere as Claude is creating automaticconnections between all of my differentnodes, which leads to insights that Iwouldn't have come up with on my own.With this system, your ideas andresearch work for you without you havingto put in any extra effort at all. So,let's see how you can set it up. How dowe connect Claude with Obsidian? Well,there's a couple of steps you need tofollow, but if you just follow alongwith me, you'll be there in no time.

There's a couple of things you need.First of all, you need Claw for desktop.You cannot use the web client forthis because you need the full desktopapplication to use MCP servers. It's avery simple install. Next, you need tohave Python installed and you need toinstall UV, which is a package managerfor Python because this is going to bethe tool that Claude will call to startup the MCP server whenever Cloud Desktopstarts. Again, no worries if you don'thave this. All the links will be in thedescription.

Next, we're going to beGreat open-source contributor. I'vechecked out a couple different variantsof these servers, and some of them areread-only, but this one also allows youto create files, which is very nice, andI'll show that later on. So, once you'veinstalled the cloud desktop app, I wouldrecommend making sure you've got UVinstalled. The way that you can installthat in Mac or Linux is with a simplecommand. So, I'm going to go ahead andpaste that in my terminal just to makesure I've got it all installed. And

there you go. It is. And then the nextthing I'm going to do is I’m going to goahead and clone that MCP Obsidianserver. Great. So now if I check out ls,you can see that I've got MCP Obsidianinstalled right there. If I go into thefolder, you will see that there's a coupleof files. You know, it indicates it's aPython project, etc. So what else do weneed? Well, if we check out therepository instructions, you see that weneed to get an Obsidian REST API key.

But Obsidian doesn't really have a RESTAPI available by default. However,there's a great community plugin that wecan enable in our vault that gives us aREST API.

Open up Obsidian, and I'm going to goahead and create a new vault. So, I'mgoing to click on File. Then, I'mgoing to do Open Vault, and I'mgoing to create a new vault in the samelocation where I put the MCP project,but I'm going to put this vault inthe same folder as the MCP project. Youdon't have to do that, but it's justconvenient for me to show it off. AndI'm just going to call it MCP test fornow. Then, in terms of folder, I'm goingto put it in that folder where I put theMCP server. Again, not necessary, but Ijust prefer to do that in this case. SoI open up the vault, and what I can do

now is, in the settings, I will go toCommunity Plugins and turn on communityplugins. Then I'm going to go ahead andbrowse the community plugins, and I'mgoing to find the REST API plugin righthere. And this is the one you need. It'sused by a lot of different people, andit's quite a great plugin. I'm going toinstall it and immediately enable it aswell. And then check out the options,because in the options we will find theAPI key. Now I'm just showing this APIkey in plain text. It doesn't matterbecause I only run this locally.

You could technically host your MCP serveron some kind of cloud service, and thenthat way, of course, you will need thisAPI key. But in my case, it's justsomething that's necessary. But yeah, itdoesn't really hurt for me to share itbecause I'm running all of this locally.No other computer can actually accessthis API server, so it's totally fine.

Now I'm going to go ahead and copy thisAPI key, and we need to place itsomewhere, right? But where do weactually place it? Well, I'm going to goand reopen that terminal of mine becauseI'm going to put it in a .env file in thatfolder that we cloned. So, I'm justgoing to use Nano to create a new file.

You can also just do this in VS Code ora text editor; it’s totally fine. And thenyou want to call this Obsidian API key.Now, I'm getting that from therepository instructions. You see herethat you can create a .env file and youneed to use this Obsidian API key valueand then paste your API key in there. SoI'm going to go ahead and do exactlythat; I pasted in the API key. And nowwe can simply save this file. And now ifI do ls again, you will see that we'vegot this .env file, which will be referredTo every time the server startsup. Now then, how do we actually makesure that clone can access this MCPserver? Well, we have to change the MCPserver configuration for that. And there’s acouple of different options out there,but I’m going to follow this one here.

There’s a development serverconfiguration, which I think is a greatone if you’re just starting out. And youcan see here that UV is being used byClaude to start up the server. So, onething I do need to know is the directorywhere I put this folder in. So, I’mgoing to go ahead and check that out.

So, I’m going to cd out of that specificfolder and then just check out what mycurrent working directory is. And thenthat’s great. I’m going to refer to thatas well. But where do we actually putthis JSON configuration? Well, for that,let’s open Claude and have a look atwhere the MCP config actually is. So,once you open Claude, what you can do isyou can go into the CLA settings andthen check out developer and click onedit config. And then you’ll eventuallyjust land in the location where yourconfig JSON is defined. So, I’m going togo and open this one with just a simpleThe text editor, and you'll be able to seethat it's just a plain file at themoment. There's not much in here. So,I'm going to go ahead and copy thisdefinition from that repository andpaste it in here. Just going to movesome things around here because I do, ofcourse, want to change that directory toactually refer to the directory whereI've got this MCP server installed.

So, again, I have printed out thedirectory in here. So, I'm going to goahead and paste that and replace thevalue here with that. Now, that shouldbe all you need to do to get it to work.

But in my experience, I have had troublewith Claude finding this UV command. Sowhat I recommend you do is checkwhere exactly UV was installed by typinga command like whichUV. And in my case, I'm actually justgoing to copy this direct path where UVis installed. Whether you have to dothis or not depends on yourconfiguration, your machine, but I foundthis to be much more reliable. So I'mgoing to save it like this. So, it'sgoing to call UV with this directorycommand, and it will run the MCP Obsidianserver.

It will automatically install and keepdependencies installed for you, andyou don't have to do that manually.It will just do it the first time thatthis command runs. So, this is all thatyou should need to do. I'm going togo ahead and quit that config, and I'mjust going to also quit Claude andrestart Cloud Desktophere. Now, Claude is pretty silent. Itdoesn't really tell you much aboutwhether or not the MCP server isinstalled or not. However, you canactually see that I've now got this kindof tool icon with an eight availablebecause I've got eight MCP tools

available to me now. So, I can do thingslike appending content to a new orexisting file in a vault. I can do acomplex search, get file contents. It'sreally cool. But I'm just going to goahead and show you how this actuallyworks. So, let's go and open ourObsidian vault right next to Claude tosee how Cloud can investigate and updatethe vault as we go. Cool. So, you cansee that I've got an empty vault. Andjust to test, I can ask it to create anew file with random facts in Obsidian.So, this is just a nice random test toSee if it even works in the first place.

And now you can see that it's going torun that tool from MCP Obsidian. And youcan see that it passes parameters likethe file path, the content, and now Ihave to give permission for it to usethat tool. I'm just going to allow itfor this chat because it's convenient tojust be able to, you know, not have toclick that button every single time.

Right. And now you can indeed see thatthere's this random facts markdown file.Really cool stuff now. Of course, Claudeis pretty smart. So when you wanted toactually consistently create things likeconnections in your graph view, it canalso do that. It all just depends on howwell you define what Claude is supposedto be doing for you.

So in my case, I'mcurious to see if it can actually reworkthis file and maybe create a couple ofconnections and then create a couple ofother files to prove that it canunderstand how to create connectionsindependently. So let's go ahead and asksomething like that, right? I want youto prove you can createmeaningful connections tofill up my graph view in Obsidian, editAnd add a few more files to crossreference. Let's see how it picks up onthistask. So, first it's going to edit thatfile. Sure, goahead. And then you can already see,boom, we're getting interesting thingsin our graph view. I'm going to go aheadand highlight that a little bit becauseI know it's quite small. Let's go aheadand zoom in so you can indeed see. Whoa.

Okay, it's going quite quickly. You cansee it's starting to add animal facts,plant facts, and random facts. And therandom facts. Whoa. Okay, I can barelykeep up. It's connected to a coupledifferent elements. So, oh goodness.Maybe we should give this a second toprocess because it just keeps adding newand new information. Um, yeah, you cansee that on the left. It's just creatingnew and new files. So, I'm actually justgoing to go ahead and just stop it fromgenerating because I'm happy with this,but it's going a bit too crazy. I justwant to show how it works. So, you cansee here, for example, that random factsis connected to our history facts andthat is connected to historicaloddities. So, you can really see that.

Claude understands the point of Obsidianand how to create these differentconnections. So, I can, for example,click on historical oddities and getinto this new file that it created. Now,the nice thing about this is that itmeans that you can just give it a dumpof whatever notes you want to take, andthen it will create the connections foryou and keep them up to date if youmight be missing connections. I findthis to be amazing because while I likethe idea behind Obsidian and creatingthese connections, I find that I myselfoften forget to create them when I needto. So, it's really nice to have asystem that could create them for youproactively or just review your entirevault for you to see if you miss anyconnections. Really cool stuff. So, I'mgoing to give you some pro tips herethat you should really follow to get themost out of this plug-in because while Ishowed you some random examples, youwant to make this work for your usecase, right? So, I recommend you tocreate a separate cloud project and callit something like Obsidian Note Taker.

Now, the great thing about having aseparate project is that you can makeCloud is much more proactive and alwaysusing this Obsidian MCP tool. So, forexample, I can set project instructionsand say, "Use the Obsidian MCP tool asmuch as possible to help me out." Thegreat thing is that with something like thisyou can also immediately createa structured vault. For example, let'ssay that you want to use the PAR methodto keep track of your life's projectsand to organize your work. Well, I canask Claude to fill up myvault with example folder filestructures so I can follow the PARmethod. And if I do this, you will seehow easy it is to actually set up thatinitial vault. So, I'm just going toallow it to use MCP Obsidian for thisentire chat. And on the right here, Iactually cleared out that vault thatwe created previously, just so we have aclean start again. And once we getstarted here, you can actually see thatit creates a project folder, an areasfolder, and all of them have differentREADME files, which is great. We'restarting to get the resources folder nowas well. And then we are missing one. Weshould be getting something else here.

Yep, here we go. So, we also have theThe archive folder, which is great. So, evenif you're not familiar with the PARAmethod, you can ask Claude what it meansand how much your current vault complieswith the PARA method. And then you seethat it already proactively fills itwith just a couple of examples like theannual tax filing project here or thehealth area with fitness tracking andmedical information. Now, of course,this is all just examples, but you cansee how powerful this is and how you canapply it to your workflow and whateverway you use Obsidian. Now, if youthought this video was useful, youshould really check out the community inthe description below where I teach youhow you can become an AI native engineerusing tools like this to make yourselfmore productive and work together withAI models to create your future. I'llsee you there.

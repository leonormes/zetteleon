- Summary: The measurement problem asks why observing a quantum system can change its result. Some theories say an observer’s beliefs or consciousness might help determine what happens. Physicists disagree and there is no consensus, so these ideas remain speculative.

Here’s what you’ll learn in this story:

* The measurement problem in quantum mechanics looks at how an experimental outcome changes, simply by observing it.
* While most physicists agree that human observation isn’t needed for a particular outcome to occur, some branches of probability argue that an observer’s beliefs about a quantum system could result in the observation of distinct outcomes.
* As a thought experiment, this idea brings up scenarios in which “reality” measurements can be more subjective.

It’s a tale told many times over: A cat is left inside a box with a potentially deadly radioactive isotope. Is the cat dead or alive?

According to Austrian-Irish physicist Erwin Schrödinger, who designed this [thought experiment](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64358936/hot-schrodingers-cat/) in 1935 as an analog for the behavior of quantum systems, the cat is both alive *and* dead until someone opens the box to observe it. At that moment, this superposition of states collapses into a single observable state, alive *or* dead.

But what exactly made this happen? Was it because a human made an observation, or would the same outcome have occurred if a robot had made the observation instead?

This kind of mind-bending question is known as the measurement problem in [quantum mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65368553/quantum-entanglement-in-brain-consciousness/), and it’s a question that many physicists have lost sleep over—including Albert Einstein—and one that scientists still don’t quite have a definitive answer to. While most physicists agree that humans are not an essential part of this observation, some branches of probability, called QBism (Quantum Bayesianism), argue that an observer’s personal beliefs about a quantum system could result in the observation of distinct outcomes or realities.

Following this line of thinking can lead to even trippier questions. For example, does human [consciousness](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a66069227/science-of-true-darkness/) shape our reality? Does what an observer believes about Schrödinger’s cat help make the determination of whether the cat is alive or dead? What is really true is up for interpretation, including the idea that maybe we’re better off not knowing at all.

The measurement problem “is really a mystery of the universe, [but] I cannot believe that it is a problem,” says Magdalena Zych, PhD, a theoretical physics researcher at Stockholm University in Sweden. “We just have to somehow accept that there is this inherent randomness.”

In reality, the quantum systems that scientists work with are very different from cats in boxes.

Instead of cats, physicists study the behavior of particles, like photons or electrons. These experiments make measurements about fundamental properties like particle spin or momentum. But, not all at the same time. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dictates that to know one definite property of a particle means that you can’t definitely know another.

Eric Cavalcanti, PhD, is an associate professor of applied math, statistics, and physics at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia who researches the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics. He describes a typical quantum experiment where the state of an electron becomes entangled with a magnetic field, causing the path of the electron to enter a superposition. Putting a detector at the end of these potential paths is how a measurement can be made, he says.

“If an electron hits the detector it will ionize many atoms and lead to a cascade of electrons flowing into some large, microscopic current,” Cavalcanti says. “Which is when it is typically identified that a measurement has been made.”

But what about humans making this observation? Zych says you can make the argument that humans are also such a quantum system that can become entangled or “correlated”—after all, we are fundamentally made up of smaller quantum systems— but that human [consciousness](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a67953085/cia-gateway-process-secrets-revealed/) still wouldn’t be a necessary ingredient for the observation or measurement to take place.

“Physical observations [that] we do with our eyes very much count as a measurement,” she says, comparing photons hitting the human eye to photons hitting detectors in a lab. “The very interaction between the photons and the system will already play all the role of the measuring apparatus, so there is no need to add consciousness.”

While not necessary in the lab, the human observer does become important in thought experiments that explore the boundaries of this measurement problem. In these experiments, particles are swapped for imaginary physicists called Alice and Bob, and sometimes their friends, Charlie and Debbie.

Zych and Cavalcanti have both contributed to separate research that use this construction to explore the boundaries of measurements in quantum systems. [A 2020 paper](https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525083&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41567-020-0990-x) that Cavalcanti contributed to in *Nature Physics* investigates a variation of the [Wigner’s friend paradox](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a36633457/wigners-friend-paradox/), which looks at observers observing an observation, and finds that the “reality” of these measurements may be more subjective than previously thought. Zych explored similar reality-bending ideas in [a 2019 paper](https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525083&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-019-11579-x) published in *Nature Communications* that explored the idea that [time](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65653221/science-of-precognition-explained/) could also be in a superposition, meaning that it may be possible for an effect to sometimes come before the cause.

Does this all mean that we’re living in our own bespoke realities and that one day we could see a glass shatter before it was dropped? Not exactly. These examples are highly specific, and in the case of Zych’s require Alice and Bob to first experience time-dilation while orbiting a star in space.

While Zych and Cavalcanti’s ideas don’t directly apply to the human experience, that doesn’t stop scientists in other fields from exploring quantum phenomena in relation to the human condition.

One recent example is [a March 2025 paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2025.1551960/full) published in the journal *Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience* by Darren Edwards, PhD, an associate professor of public health and cognitive psychologist at Swansea University in Wales, UK. Inspired by ideas like QBism, Edwards proposes something called the “N-frame model” which argues that consciousness of a human observer is a crucial part of quantum observations and that a person’s conscious thoughts can affect how a superposition of states will collapse when observed.

“In psychology … the observer is not a passive recorder but an active shaper of experience, where perception is guided by context and expectation,” Edwards says in an email. “Similarly, in quantum mechanics, measurement is not simply passive detection … N-Frame uses these parallels to model the observer in a way that can bridge psychology and quantum mechanics, ultimately aiming to create meaningful tests for consciousness—whether human or artificial.”

Ideas like this don’t necessarily jive with current thinking in quantum physics, but Cavalcanti says he can see how these fundamental problems in quantum mechanics can influence how humans think about their own consciousness and reality. Although, he still believes that ultimately our observed reality is something determined by nature, not humans’ thoughts.

Which ideas you believe in depends on which interpretation of quantum mechanics you believe, he says, and fortunately—or maybe, unfortunately—there are plenty of those to go around.

“The status of [this] question in physics at the moment is that we have many options, but there’s no consensus on what the right answer is,” he says.

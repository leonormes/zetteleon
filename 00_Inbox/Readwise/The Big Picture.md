### Highlights
#### The Fundamental Nature of Reality
- What is the fundamental nature of reality? Philosophers call this the question of ontology—the study of the basic structure of the world, the ingredients and relationships of which the universe is ultimately composed. It can be contrasted with epistemology, which is how we obtain knowledge about the world. Ontology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of reality; we also talk about “an” ontology, referring to a specific idea about what that nature actually is.

- The broader ontology typically associated with atheism is naturalism— there is only one world, the natural world, exhibiting patterns we call the “laws of nature,” and which is discoverable by the methods of science and empirical investigation. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZWHR4CB&location=235))
- Purpose and meaning in life arise through fundamentally human acts of creation, rather than being derived from anything outside ourselves. Naturalism is a philosophy of unity and patterns, describing all of reality as a seamless web. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZWHR4CB&location=239))
- If you listed about one atom per second, it would take more than a trillion times the current age of the universe to describe a ship like Theseus’s. Not really practical. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZWHR4CB&location=346))
- It just means that the notion of a ship is a derived category in our ontology, not a fundamental one. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZWHR4CB&location=348))
- It’s hard to overemphasize the importance of this shift. Of course, even today, we talk about causes and effects all the time. But if you open the contemporary equivalent of Aristotle’s Physics—a textbook on quantum field theory, for example—words like that are nowhere to be found. We still, with good reason, talk about causes in everyday speech, but they’re no longer part of our best fundamental ontology.

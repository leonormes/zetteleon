## Highlights
- There are so many people working so hard and achieving so little. —Andy Grove ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078X4HKS9&location=340))
- The Santa Clara headquarters was an open expanse of low-walled cubicles, not yet a design cliché. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078X4HKS9&location=351))
- It almost doesn’t matter what you know …. To claim that knowledge was secondary and execution all-important—well, I wouldn’t learn that at Harvard. I found the proposition thrilling, a real-world affirmation of accomplishment over credentials. But Grove wasn’t finished, and he had saved the best for last. Over a few closing minutes, he outlined a system he’d begun to install in 1971, when Intel was three years old. It was my first exposure to the art of formal goal setting. I was mesmerized.

- Andy Grove was accustomed to having the last word, so let’s give it to him here. “Bad companies,” Andy wrote, “are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them.” So it was for Operation Crush. ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078X4HKS9&location=688))

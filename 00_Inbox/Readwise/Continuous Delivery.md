### Metadata
- Author: [[Jez Humble, David Farley]]
- Full Title: Continuous Delivery
- Category: #books

### Highlights
- The longer the release cycle, the longer the development team has to make incorrect assumptions before the deployment occurs, and the longer it will take to fix them. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003YMNVC0&location=829))
- The remedy is to integrate the testing, deployment, and release activities into the development process. Make them a normal and ongoing part of development so that by the time you are ready to release your system into production there is little to no risk, because you have rehearsed it on many different occasions in a progressively more production-like sequence of test environments. Make sure everybody involved in the software delivery process, from the build and release team to testers to developers, work together from the start of the project. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003YMNVC0&location=840))
- People are expensive and valuable, and they should be focused on producing software that delights its users and then delivering those delights as fast as possible—not on boring, errorprone tasks like regression testing, virtual server provisioning, and deployment, which are best done by machines. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003YMNVC0&location=961))
- If any of them fails, it means our application has a critical fault and should not be released under any circumstances. That means that a test to check the color of a UI element should not be included in this set of tests. ([Location 969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003YMNVC0&location=969))
- Does This Process Scale? One common objection we hear is that the process we describe is idealistic. It may work in small teams, these detractors say, but it can’t possibly work in my huge, distributed project! ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003YMNVC0&location=1002))
- Readers will notice that much of this book is inspired by the philosophy and ideas of the lean movement. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003YMNVC0&location=1007))

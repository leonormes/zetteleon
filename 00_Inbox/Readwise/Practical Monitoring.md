### Metadata
- Author: [[Mike Julian]]
- Full Title: Practical Monitoring
- Category: #books

### Highlights
- An anti-pattern is something that looks like a good idea, but which backfires badly when applied. Jim Coplien ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076XZWQVW&location=135))
- These anti-patterns can often be difficult to fix for various reasons: entrenched practices and culture, legacy infrastructure, or just plain old FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076XZWQVW&location=136))
    - Note: FUD comes up; a lot. I am wondering if some of our alerts are still about because of it

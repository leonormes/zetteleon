- Timaeus adds that a man who masters his emotions will live a life of reason and justice, and will be reborn into a celestial heaven of eternal happiness. A man who is mastered by his passions, however, will be reincarnated as a woman. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076O2VMI&location=613))
- worshipful attitude throughout this book as the rationalist delusion. I call it a delusion because when a group of people make something sacred, the members of the cult lose the ability to think clearly about it.

- I worked with a talented undergraduate, Scott Murphy. Our plan was to increase the amount of dumbfounding by having Scott play devil’s advocate rather than gentle interviewer. When Scott succeeded in stripping away arguments, would people change their judgments? Or would they become morally dumbfounded, clinging to their initial judgments while stammering and grasping for reasons?

- showing that we judge attractive people to be smarter and more virtuous, and we are more likely to give a pretty face the benefit of any doubt.16 Juries are more likely to acquit attractive defendants, and when beautiful people are convicted, judges give them lighter sentences, on average.17 That’s normal affective primacy making everyone lean toward the defendant, which tips off their riders to interpret the evidence in a way that will support the elephant’s desire to acquit.

- Suppose the gods were to flip a coin on the day of your birth. Heads, you will be a supremely honest and fair person throughout your life, yet everyone around you will believe you’re a scoundrel. Tails, you will cheat and lie whenever it suits your needs, yet everyone around you will believe you’re a paragon of virtue. Which outcome would you prefer?

    - Note: Needed somewhere to write. Straightimg out ideas in my mind sorts the chaff that confuses the issue. When things are mixed together it is hard to conceptual ise. When i try to put things in order i am removing the unimportant to get to the first principles

- Summary: Timeboxing is a time management technique where you set a fixed amount of time to complete a task and commit to finishing it within that period. It helps you stay focused and overcome procrastination by breaking tasks into manageable chunks. This method can improve productivity and create a better balance between different activities in your life.

## Highlights
- Timeboxing is a simple time management technique that involves allotting a fixed, maximum unit of time for an activity in advance, and then complete the activity within that time frame. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwccjswknbxvp7mhavkea0bh))

- In gist, timeboxing is a time management technique where you allocate a fixed time period to a planned activity. You work on the activity during the fixed time period and stop working on it once the time is up - then, you assess whether you've reached your planned goals.

- Define your goals
  Once you've picked out your tasks, think about what you want to accomplish with them, and in what time.
  For example, if you're working on writing a 10,000-word research paper, and you have 30 days to finish it, your long-term goal is clear - you want to write a well-researched paper before the 30 days are up, and get a good grade for it.
  But, in order to reach this ultimate goal, you'll also want to make it your goal to write a certain number of words per day - this preset number of words will be the daily milestone you'll need to reach each day.
  To beat this deadline, you'll have to write about 400 words per day - which means you'll finish in 25 days (400x25=10,000), and still have 5 extra days for revisions and editing, as well as unexpected errands that may throw you off track and make you lose time.
  When it comes to tasks you lack the motivation to do, you can make working on said tasks during a timebox a goal in itself - for example, make cleaning up your room for 15 minutes your sole goal. You can even make this timebox a recurring one - work on cleaning up your room for 15 minutes every day, and by the end of the week, you'll probably find that you've made great progress, without even breaking a serious sweat.

- Set the time
  Once you've decided on the task you'll tackle, and the goals you want to reach by tackling it, it's time you allocate a time period to this task - this step is almost identical to the second step in the time blocking time management technique.
  So, you decide when you'll start working on the task, and when you'll stop working on it - if the time frame permits, you can even mark this time in your calendar, to make sure you stay on track with your errands.
  As mentioned in the first step, you'll probably timebox your most demanding tasks, or tasks you lack the motivation to do - so, you'll need an optimal, short timebox to help make these tasks manageable.
  Let's take the 10,000-word research paper as an example once again - you've already figured out you need to write (and edit) 400 words every day, but you'll also want to limit the *time* per day you'll spend working on this task. And that's when classic timeboxing finally kicks in.
  You can limit your timebox for writing and editing the research paper to 3 hours per day - mark this time in your daily agenda, and make sure you stick to it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwccnb9ndqdfvmy2kze1gg4q))
- **Soft timebox** - soft timeboxes encompass one larger task you've broken down into smaller subtasks. Each time you finish one timebox, you move on the next related timebox. You keep your focus on one type of task, and there's a continuous flow, only slightly disrupted by symbolic milestones meant to help you parse your work and make it more manageable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwccpfzr34q2gk5r130r6y0y))
- **Hard timebox** - hard timeboxes are tasks you'll no longer think about once you're done with them. Each time you finish one timebox, you move on to the next, completely unrelated timebox. You shift your focus to a different type of task, and the milestones are more prominent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwccph2jrdba6h8vet5gkphz))
- Well, according to the [often discussed science of ultradian rhythms](https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/time-blocking/) the human mind cannot concentrate on a task for more than 90 minutes - so you should never allocate more than 90 minutes in one sitting to any task. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwccqjr5dwctywgagv41bcav))
- The length of your timeboxes is completely up to you, and the tasks you have to do - 15, 20, 30, or 45 minutes, they're all great choices for different types of tasks. Just make sure you never go over 90 minutes without taking a break. Which brings us to the next tip. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwccqqm2eskh6t5yb5tmshc9))

## Highlights
- Consider the political-science title: ‘The idea of a united Europe’: this noun-phrase seems to invite a simple display of knowledge, though it gives you little idea about where you might start. The title as a claim would, at least, invite an argument:         ‘The idea of a united Europe is unrealistic.’ Discuss.

- By breaking down a question into sub-questions, you can begin to set the parts of your overall argument into a meaningful order, and give direction to your thinking. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KQK8ZQ0&location=387))
- For Darwin, evidence came before claim—at least, this is what he implies here. In fact, he had a pretty good idea what he was looking for (a ‘principle’; a theory; a claim that he would make) in order to know what facts would be of use to him. It is no good looking for evidence before knowing what it might be evidence of. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KQK8ZQ0&location=464))

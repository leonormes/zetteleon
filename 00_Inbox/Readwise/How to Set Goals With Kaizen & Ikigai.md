## Highlights
- A bad teacher, or parent, can make you doubt your own abilities, for years to come. If you let their words continue to sting, you’ll continually assume that you’ll make the same mistakes, again and again. Even if a thousand other people tell you “You can do it,” the discursive meanderings of your inner voice, may insist that “you cannot.” ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NCTD4SM&location=228))
- This process is exemplified in this Toyota post: Even if a task is completed successfully, Toyota recognizes the need for a hansei-kai, [a] reflection meeting—a process that helps to identify failures experienced along the way, and create clear plans for future efforts. An inability to identify issues is usually seen as an indication that you did not stretch to meet or exceed expectations, that you were not sufficiently critical or objective in your analysis, or that you lack modesty and humility. Within the process, no problem is itself a problem. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NCTD4SM&location=459))

- Pick one failure or mistake you made in your recent past. Then, ask the following questions: What was your original goal? What efforts did you make toward this goal? What was the outcome of your efforts? What were you expecting? Why didn’t you get what you wanted? What were the wrong decisions you made, and why did they seem rational at the time?

- Consistently going through the process of daily contemplative reflection, will help to reveal your negative tendencies. Do your bad habits follow a pattern? Do they reliably occur at a certain time of day? Are your bad habits connected to any other negative aspect of your life?

- Look at the good to identify the bad If you only look at your failures, it can fill your mind with negative emotions. Recognizing mistakes is indeed of pivotal importance in Hansei. But this does not mean you cannot take time to reflect on what worked. And compliment yourself on your efforts that paid off.

- Let your mistakes become a driving factor that increases your commitment. Develop an inner process for refining your thoughts and beliefs. Your commitment to achieving a goal should always overpower a setback. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NCTD4SM&location=651))
- As 19th century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard wrote: Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NCTD4SM&location=699))
- Hansei provides a moment to digest the life choices of our past, and to analyze the teaching that failure brings. It is common to feel bad about the consequences of failing. But the point of this process is not to punish yourself, nor is it to shame yourself into redemption. Rather, it’s about self-improvement and utilizing past lessons to avoid recurring mistakes, and the recidivism of unhealthy habits.

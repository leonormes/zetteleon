    - Note: Q: Why aren't I reading books and what can I do about it
      A: You're likely not reading books because reading is a deeply personal, intentional activity that requires internal motivation, effort to find good books, and sustained focus without immediate rewards—unlike other media that's heavily marketed and designed for easy consumption. To read more, reduce distractions by managing phone use, find appealing books through recommendations or bookstores, adjust your reading habits by quitting books you don't like or reading multiple types, carry books with you, and create challenges or schedules that give you purpose and structure.

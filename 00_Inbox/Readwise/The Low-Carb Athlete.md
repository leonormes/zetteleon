## Highlights
- Carbohydrate Intake During Long Workouts: This is where things get interesting because there are two options: ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015M1MHFC&location=180))
- If you use this approach, your gut needs to be trained to absorb as many calories as it will be taking in on race day. So if you are, say, a Half-Ironman or Ironman endurance athlete, about once every two weeks, one of your long workouts (typically the bike or run) will need to be accompanied by the use of gels, sports drinks, bars, or other carbohydrate sources that you plan on using during the race. This is basically “training your gut.” You don’t need to do this very frequently, but just enough to allow you to become used to the nutrition plan you will be implementing during race day. Although volume will vary significantly depending on one’s size and training status, calorie intake for these carbohydrate-fueled long workouts for males will be 300-450 calories per hour on the bike and 200-300 calories per hour on the run, and for females will be 250-400 calories per hour on the bike and 150-250 calories per hour on the run. All your other long workouts can be minimally fueled, with a half to a quarter as many calories as you plan on consuming on race day, and you do not need to fuel at all during any workouts that are an hour or less. This practice of “minimally” training your gut to digest higher amounts of carbohydrates will help you to become fat adapted, and is much different than the typical practice that athletes implement of fueling every training session as though it were a race.

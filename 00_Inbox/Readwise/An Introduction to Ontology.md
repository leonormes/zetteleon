## Highlights
- Those not acquainted with these symbols will be able to find good introductions in a variety of places. I highly recommend Paul Tomassi’s Logic or, if you want something shorter, Joe Morrison’s Logic. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EUYBWP4&location=172))

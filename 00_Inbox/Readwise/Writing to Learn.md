## Highlights
- Another is that the essence of writing is rewriting. Very few writers say on their first try exactly what they want to say. Recently ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BOQEBFE&location=248))
- Beware of dashing. “Effortless” articles that look as if they were dashed off are the result of strenuous effort. A piece of writing must be viewed as a constantly evolving organism. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BOQEBFE&location=254))
- Thomas Gover’s tales of Wöhler and Mendeleyev and other chemists who journeyed into the unknown, I thought, “What an interesting subject!”—no small thought for someone with chemistry anxiety. Then I thought: Probably every subject is interesting if an avenue into it can be found that has humanity and that an ordinary person can follow. Writing was such an avenue—perhaps, in fact, the main route. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BOQEBFE&location=304))
- Where does writing figure in all this? Writing is a tool that enables people in every discipline to wrestle with facts and ideas. It’s a physical activity, unlike reading. Writing requires us to operate some kind of mechanism—pencil, pen, typewriter, word processor—for getting our thoughts on paper. It compels us by the repeated effort of language to go after those thoughts and to organize them and present them clearly. It forces us to keep asking, “Am I saying what I want to say?” Very often the answer is “No.” It’s a useful piece of information.

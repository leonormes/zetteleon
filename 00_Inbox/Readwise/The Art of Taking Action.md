## Highlights
- The new discovery is… Taking Action: Doing what needs to be done When it needs to be done In response to the needs of the situation. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PR814K0&location=215))
    - Note: Puts the benefits felt from doing the action as if it were an antidote to life's ills. Taking action is the purpose of thought but I have got to a point where thought is itself an ends
- The traditional mental health system has generally overlooked this approach in lieu of talk therapy, self-analysis, dream interpretation, and so forth. Yet the ability to get things done has tremendous healing power. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PR814K0&location=219))
    - Note: I am sure that trying to think yourself happy doesn't work. The brain is not trying to get to an end point. It is live and ready to deal with whatbis happening now.
- Talking about what you need to do, researching your options, making a plan, going to therapy, ruminating about your inaction—these can all be effective strategies for avoiding what you know needs doing. The bottom line is you know what to do and you just need to do it! ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PR814K0&location=268))
    - Note: Haha, yes. My whole life.
- The fundamental change we need is a shift from a feeling-centered approach to decisions to a purpose-centered approach. The question isn’t “What do I feel like doing?” but, rather, “what needs to be done?” ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PR814K0&location=1480))
- Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn ([Location 1604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PR814K0&location=1604))
- He categorized three habits of mind that stop us from “just doing it.” •    Checking: defined as second-guessing ourselves or others; •    Holding: hanging on to feelings about an interaction after it was completed; for example, bearing a grudge; and •    Making: taking the words or actions of another and inventing a story about what our mind thinks those actions/words meant. (I call this finding a thread and knitting a sweater out of it.) ([Location 1615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PR814K0&location=1615))

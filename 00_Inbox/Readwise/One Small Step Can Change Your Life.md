## Highlights
- When we’re sitting, our muscles go into a form of hibernation, causing our bodies to shut down the enzyme (called KK1) that breaks down some of the fat in the blood. ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=48))
- So when you ask small questions, your amygdala (where the fight-or-flight response occurs) will remain asleep, and the cortex, always hungry for a good time, will wake up and take notice. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=494))
- If you tend to berate yourself with negative questions (Why am I so fat?), try asking: What is one thing I like about myself today? Ask this question daily, writing your answer down in a journal or on a sheet of paper you keep in a specially designated place. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=598))
- If I were guaranteed not to fail, what would I be doing differently? ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=648))
- What is one small step I could take toward reaching my goal? ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=652))
- What is one small step I could take to improve my health (or relationships, or career, or any other area)? ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=657))
- Is there a person at work or in my personal life whose voice and input I haven’t heard in a long time? What small question could I ask this person? ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=660))
- What is one small thing that is special about me (or ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=665))
- They can’t overcome the cultural training that says change must always be instantaneous, it must always require steely self-discipline, and it must never be pleasurable. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=901))
- Resolution: Use time more productively. Small Steps: Make a list of activities that take up your time but are not useful or stimulating to you. Watching television, browsing through stores, and reading things you don’t find pleasant or productive are frequent sources of poorly used time. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1005))
- We are so accustomed to living with minor annoyances that it’s not always easy to identify them, let alone make corrections. But these annoyances have a way of acquiring mass and eventually blocking your path to change. By training yourself to spot and solve small problems, you can avoid undergoing much more painful remedies later. ([Location 1104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1104))
- Learning to Spot Small Problems Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20, and it’s always easier to spot a crack in the ceiling after rain has soaked the plaster. But it’s possible to train yourself to see small warning signs more clearly. Try these exercises to sharpen your small-problem vision: ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1135))
- Recall a major mistake you’ve made at some point in your life. Now, take some time to consider whether there were small signs along the way indicating that things were not going according to your plans or wishes. What measures did you have to take to correct the problem? Did you halt your “assembly line” and start all over? Did you ignore the problem in the hopes you’d achieve your result on time anyway? ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1138))
- Identify one small mistake you have made today, without becoming angry with yourself for making this mistake. This single act, especially if you perform it daily, will raise your awareness of small mistakes. ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1141))
- Now ask yourself whether the small mistake you identified in exercise 2 reflects a larger problem, or if it has the potential to gather velocity. (If you misplaced your car keys, for example, ask yourself if you are trying to juggle too many things at once, or are so distracted that you might eventually make a more serious mistake.) By paying attention to this mistake, you will reduce its frequency. If you feel this mistake indicates a more significant problem in your life, ask yourself: What kaizen step can I take to correct this situation? ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1142))
- Ask yourself whether there are ways in which you irritate your family, friends, co-workers, or customers. Your new awareness alone reduces the probability that you will make this mistake again, but you should also ask yourself whether this mistake is part of a bigger problem. If you can peg the error to a larger issue, you’ll give yourself further incentive to work on it! ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1146))
- “Confront the difficult while it is still easy; accomplish the great task by a series of small acts.” —Tao Te Ching ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1188))
- Any resistance to the small step you have chosen. The challenge is to make the step so small that it is effortless. If your inner voice is harsh and angry at you for not making the change sooner, it will demand a bigger step than may be practical. Remember, you are counting on the repetition of the small step to “program” the brain for the life changes you wish to make. Even small signs that you are resisting the small step—that you are having to push yourself to do the step—are an indication that the step is too big, inviting the amygdala and the harsh voice to awaken and interfere.

- “No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.” —Aesop, “The Lion and the Mouse” ([Location 1381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GU2RHCG&location=1381))

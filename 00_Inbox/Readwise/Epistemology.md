## Epistemology

![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Cs0IBp02L._SL200_.jpg)

### Metadata
- Author: [[Robert M. Martin]]
- Full Title: Epistemology
- Category: #books

### Highlights
- A belief that’s just a hunch or a guess doesn’t carry with it a great likelihood of being true, no matter how strongly it’s held. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00L1EP1RG&location=422))
    - Note: Being true is context dependent. On some level it is true that I am holding a Google phone. But on a quantum level it is just energy, particles and probability.

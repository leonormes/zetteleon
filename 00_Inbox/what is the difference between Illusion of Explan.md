While both the Illusion of Explanatory Depth (IOED) and the Dunning-Kruger effect involve an overestimation of one's own understanding or ability, they differ in their focus and the specific nature of the overestimation.1

The Illusion of Explanatory Depth (IOED) refers to the tendency for people to believe they understand complex phenomena or the workings of devices with far greater detail and coherence than they actually do.2 This illusion is particularly strong for *explanatory knowledge* – the understanding of how things work or the causal relationships within a system.3 The core of the IOED is that individuals can often recognise a concept or device and may even be able to use it, leading them to *assume* they understand the underlying mechanisms in depth. However, when pressed to provide a detailed explanation, they quickly encounter the limits of their knowledge and realise their understanding is much shallower than they initially believed. This highlights a disconnect between a feeling of familiarity or recognition and actual, detailed explanatory knowledge.

The Dunning-Kruger effect, on the other hand, is a cognitive bias where people with low ability or competence in a specific task or area tend to overestimate their performance and ability compared to objective standards or their peers.4 This effect stems from a deficit in *metacognition* – the ability to accurately assess one's own knowledge and skills.5 Individuals affected by the Dunning-Kruger effect lack the very expertise required to recognise their own incompetence.6 They not only perform poorly but also lack the capacity to recognise that they are performing poorly, leading to an inflated self-assessment.7 This bias is typically observed in individuals with limited proficiency in a particular domain and relates to their overall competence or skill level, rather than specifically their ability to explain something.8

In essence, the key differences are:

- **Focus:** IOED is about overestimating one's understanding of *how things work* (explanatory knowledge), while the Dunning-Kruger effect is about overestimating one's overall *ability or competence* in a task or domain.  
- Mechanism: IOED arises from mistaking familiarity or recognition for deep understanding, often exposed when attempting to explain.9 The Dunning-Kruger effect results from a lack of the metacognitive skills needed to recognise one's own incompetence.10  
- Scope: While the Dunning-Kruger effect is most pronounced in those with low competence, the IOED can affect a broader range of people, including those with moderate knowledge, regarding complex systems they haven't tried to explain in detail.11

In simpler terms, someone experiencing the Illusion of Explanatory Depth might believe they understand how a bicycle works just by looking at and riding one, only to struggle when asked to draw or explain the function of its components. Conversely, someone affected by the Dunning-Kruger effect in the context of cycling might genuinely believe they are a highly skilled cyclist despite having poor technique and performance, because they lack the ability to accurately judge their own skills.

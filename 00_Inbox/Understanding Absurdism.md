## **Understanding Absurdism**

The video begins by introducing Albert Camus, a renowned French philosopher and Nobel Prize laureate, and his central philosophical concept: absurdism \[[00:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=1)\]. Absurdism, as explained in the video, is the inherent conflict between our human desire to find meaning in life and the universe's apparent lack of any inherent meaning \[[00:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=19)\]. To navigate this "absurd" condition, Camus suggests that we must embrace it. This involves accepting the meaninglessness of the universe and, in turn, creating our own purpose by actively engaging with the world and finding joy in the present moment \[[00:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=34), [00:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=41)\].

## **Six Ways to Enjoy Life, According to Albert Camus:**

1. **Embrace Absurdism** \[[01:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=66)\]: The video explains that Camus believed the world is fundamentally meaningless, and our constant search for meaning is what creates the feeling of absurdity \[[01:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=78)\]. He proposed three responses to this:  
   - **Suicide**: Camus rejected this, arguing that it evades the problem of meaninglessness rather than confronting it \[[01:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=111)\].  
   - **Faith**: He also rejected faith, viewing it as an escape from reality based on false promises \[[02:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=136)\].  
   - **Acceptance**: The preferred response is to accept the lack of inherent meaning and create your own, living in spite of life's limitations \[[02:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=153)\]. The video uses the myth of Sisyphus to illustrate this, showing how one can find meaning in the struggle itself, rather than in achieving an external goal \[[03:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=183), [03:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=216)\]. By accepting that you give life its meaning, you gain the freedom to change that meaning at any time, leading to a more fulfilling existence beyond societal pressures \[[05:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=302)\].  
2. **Embrace the Present Moment** \[[05:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=358)\]: Despite the absurdity of life, Camus argued that we can find meaning by appreciating the world around us in the present moment \[[06:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=371)\]. The video encourages focusing on the "here and now," fully experiencing life as it unfolds, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future \[[06:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=394)\]. This can be achieved by noticing the beauty in everyday life, seeking new perspectives, being kind to others, and practising mindfulness \[[07:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=447)\].  
3. **Cultivate Passions and Hobbies** \[[09:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=541)\]: Camus saw hobbies as a vital form of rebellion against the rigidity of life \[[09:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=560)\]. His own passion for football is used as an example of finding pleasure in physical activity and camaraderie \[[09:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=577)\]. Hobbies provide a counterbalance to monotony, offer a means of creative expression, and help us connect with the world \[[10:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=636)\]. The video stresses the importance of making time for leisure and enjoyment, even with a busy schedule, as it is an essential component of a meaningful life \[[11:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=667)\].  
4. **Choose Love** \[[11:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=719)\]: The video highlights Camus' belief that love is the most important aspect of life \[[12:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=727)\]. He advocated for prioritising love, even if it requires difficult choices or sacrifices, and for listening to one's heart \[[12:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=753)\]. Love serves as a shield against the absurdity of the world, a form of rebellion against life's challenges, and a source of protection \[[14:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=846)\]. The video advises living in the present and expressing love openly, being willing to take risks for what brings joy and fulfilment \[[14:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=859)\].  
5. **Travel** \[[15:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=900)\]: Camus viewed travel as a transformative experience that breaks routines, offers new perspectives, and pushes us out of our comfort zones \[[15:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=928)\]. It is a way to confront ourselves, embrace the absurd, and broaden our understanding of the world \[[15:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=943)\]. To counteract potential negative feelings of alienation while travelling, Camus suggested maintaining some routine, seeking connections with others, and being mindful of one's emotional state \[[16:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=997)\]. The key to successful travel, according to the video, is to find a balance between novelty and familiarity \[[17:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xple1n-c&t=1041)\].  
6. Connect with Others \[17:59\]: The video concludes by emphasising Camus' belief in the importance of human connection for our survival and well-being, especially in times of crisis \[18:04\]. He argued that grand heroic acts are not necessary; simple acts of kindness and decency can make a significant difference \[18:29\]. Human connections give life meaning and purpose \[18:37\]. Despite the challenges of modern life, such as busy schedules and technology-induced isolation, the video stresses that prioritising human connection is vital \[19:14\]. It suggests several ways to foster these connections, including engaging in meaningful conversations \[20:24\], participating in community events \[20:40\], practising empathy and compassion \[21:03\], and sharing in the joys and sorrows of others \[21:21\].

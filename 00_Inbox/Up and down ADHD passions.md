Neuroscience offers compelling insights into the cyclical nature of interests and the fluctuating intensity of thoughts experienced by individuals with ADHD, an experience you describe as a "thought battery." The book *ADHD 2.0: New Science and Essential Strategies for Thriving with Distraction* by Edward M. Hallowell, M.D., and John J. Ratey, M.D., along with broader neuroscientific research, provides a framework for understanding this phenomenon.

## **The "Glitchy Switch": Task-Positive and Default Mode Networks**

A key concept from *ADHD 2.0* that speaks to your experience is the interaction between two crucial brain networks: the **Task-Positive Network (TPN)** and the **Default Mode Network (DMN).**

- **The Task-Positive Network (TPN)** is engaged when you are focused on a task, such as working on a project or frying an egg. When the TPN is active, you are in a state of doing, often losing self-conscious awareness.  
- **The Default Mode Network (DMN)** becomes active when the mind is wandering, daydreaming, or reflecting on the past and future. The DMN is the seat of imagination and creativity.

In a neurotypical brain, these two networks have an "anticorrelation property," meaning when one is on, the other is off, like a seesaw6. However, in the ADHD brain, this switch can be "glitchy"7. The DMN can intrude on the TPN, causing distraction8. Conversely, an individual can get "stuck" in the DMN, leading to the kind of brooding and rumination you describe as dull and empty9.

When you are hyperfixated on a subject, your TPN is highly engaged, and the "glitchy switch" may be temporarily less disruptive. The thoughts feel "backed up by a strong feeling" because your brain is flooded with neurotransmitters like dopamine, which enhances motivation and makes tasks feel rewarding10. This heightened state of focus and engagement can make every related thought seem vibrant and full of potential.

## **The "Demon" Of the DMN and Emotional Dysregulation**

When you are in a period of disinterest and mental fog, it is likely that you are caught in the DMN11. For the ADHD brain, this can become a "Demon"12. This is because individuals with ADHD often have a lifetime of negative experiences, such as failure and frustration, stored in their memory banks13. When the DMN is active without a positive focus, it can lead to negative, self-critical thoughts and a feeling of emptiness14.

This ties into the concept of **Rejection-Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)**, an extreme emotional sensitivity to perceived criticism or rejection15151515. While not a formal diagnosis, it describes a common experience for those with ADHD. The "dull and empty" feeling you describe can be a manifestation of this emotional dysregulation, where the "thought battery" is depleted, and thoughts lack their usual positive charge. This experience can indeed resemble depression16.

## **The Role of the Cerebellum and Exercise**

*ADHD 2.0* also highlights the role of the cerebellum in regulating not just physical balance but also emotional and cognitive stability17. An under-stimulated or less efficient cerebellum can contribute to the emotional and attentional fluctuations seen in ADHD18. The book suggests that exercises that challenge balance and coordination can strengthen the cerebellum, potentially leading to better emotional regulation and focus191919191919191919.

Furthermore, exercise has a direct impact on brain function by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters that are crucial for attention and motivation20. A regular exercise routine can help to charge your "thought battery" more consistently.

## **The Power of "Finding Your Right Difficult"**

The book emphasizes the importance for individuals with ADHD to find their "right difficult"—a challenge that engages their creativity and strengths21. When you are in a hyperfixation period, you have likely found a temporary "right difficult." The key to maintaining a more consistent "thought battery" is to build a life that incorporates these kinds of stimulating challenges more regularly, preventing your brain from getting stuck in the "Demon" of the DMN.

In essence, your experience of a fluctuating "thought battery" is a hallmark of the ADHD brain's unique neurobiology. The intense, vibrant thoughts during periods of interest are a result of a highly engaged TPN, fuelled by dopamine. The dull, foggy periods reflect being stuck in the DMN, a state that can feel akin to depression due to the emotional dysregulation inherent in ADHD. By understanding these neurological underpinnings, you can utilise strategies like targeted exercise, structuring your environment, and actively seeking out engaging challenges to help regulate your "thought battery" and lead a more consistently fulfilling life.

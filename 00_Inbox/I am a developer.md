That's a really insightful idea, particularly with the challenges ADHD can present in terms of task initiation and maintaining a sense of relevance. Combining the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology with the user story/requirements model from software development has a lot of potential to address these specific issues.  
Let's break down why this could be effective and what it might look like:  
**Why it could be effective for you:**

1. **Focus on Value and Purpose (The "Why"):**  
   - **Standard GTD:** Sometimes, GTD tasks can become acontextual "to-dos." You know *what* you need to do, but the "why" can get lost, making tasks seem boring or irrelevant later.  
   - **User Story Approach:** User stories inherently focus on the *value* or *benefit* ("so that..."). By framing your personal projects and tasks in this way, you're constantly reminding yourself of the underlying motivation and desired outcome. This can be a powerful antidote to the "boring and irrelevant" feeling.  
2. **Empathy for Your Future Self (The "Who"):**  
   - **Standard GTD:** Tasks are often written from your current perspective.  
   - **User Story Approach:** The "As a..." part of a user story encourages you to think about the beneficiary. In a personal GTD context, this is often "As my future self," "As a relaxed me," "As a productive me," or even "As a \[role I play, e.g., 'keen gardener'\], I want...". This can help you connect more empathetically with the reasons you set the task.  
3. **Clarity on the Goal (The "What"):**  
   - **Standard GTD:** Aims for clear next actions, but the overall project goal can sometimes be less explicitly tied to each task.  
   - **User Story Approach:** The "I want to..." clearly defines the goal or action from the user's perspective. This keeps the objective front and centre.  
4. **Improved Task Initiation:**  
   - When a task is framed with a clear benefit for a specific (future) version of yourself, it can provide a stronger intrinsic motivation to start. Instead of "Do laundry," it becomes "As someone who enjoys a calm morning, I want to have clean clothes ready for the week, so that I can get dressed without stress and feel put-together." This reframing can make the task feel less like a chore and more like an act of self-care or a step towards a desired state.  
5. **Breaking Down Overwhelm (User Story Mapping):**  
   - **Standard GTD:** Project planning encourages breaking things down, but the method isn't always as visual or narratively structured as story mapping.  
   - **User Story Mapping:** This technique visually lays out the user's journey and the steps (stories/tasks) needed to achieve larger goals (epics). For someone with ADHD, seeing the whole picture and how individual tasks contribute to a larger, meaningful outcome can be incredibly helpful in reducing overwhelm and maintaining focus. It provides context and shows progress.

**What a Combined GTD and User Story/Requirements Model Might Look Like:**  
Here's how you could adapt and integrate these concepts:

1. **Capture (GTD Principle):**  
   - Continue capturing everything that has your attention. No change here.  
2. **Clarify & Organise (GTD Principles with User Story Twist):**  
   - **For Projects (anything requiring more than one step):**  
     - **Define the "Epic" or "Theme":** What's the overall big goal? This is your main project title.  
     - **Identify the "User" (You\!):** Who benefits? (e.g., "Future Me," "Productive Me," "Relaxed Me," "Me as a Learner").  
     - **Create High-Level User Stories (Project Outcomes):** Instead of just a project name like "Plan Holiday," frame it as a user story:  
       - *Example:* "As a 'Refreshed Explorer,' I want to plan a rejuvenating trip to Scotland so that I can de-stress, see new sights, and create lasting memories."  
     - **Break Down into Smaller Stories/Tasks (Requirements):** For each larger project story, break it down into smaller, actionable user stories that represent tasks or smaller goals.  
       - *Example (for the holiday):*  
         - "As a 'Refreshed Explorer,' I want to research flight and accommodation options so that I can find the best deals and comfortable places to stay."  
         - "As a 'Refreshed Explorer,' I want to draft an itinerary so that I can make the most of my time and see key attractions."  
         - "As a 'Refreshed Explorer,' I want to book flights and accommodation so that my travel plans are secured."  
   - **For Single Next Actions (if not part of a multi-step project):**  
     - You can still apply the "so that..." principle to add immediate clarity and motivation.  
     - *Example:* Instead of "Email John," try "Email John about the report *so that* I can get his feedback before the deadline and avoid a last-minute rush."  
3. **User Story Mapping for Projects:**  
   - **Visualise the Flow:** For your more significant projects, use a simple story mapping technique.  
     - **Backbone (Narrative Flow):** What are the major stages or activities of your project? (e.g., For "Write Blog Post": Idea Generation \-\> Research \-\> Drafting \-\> Editing \-\> Publishing).  
     - **User Stories/Tasks:** Under each stage, list the specific user stories/tasks you've defined.  
     - **Prioritisation (Optional but helpful):** You can arrange stories vertically by priority or in releases/phases (e.g., "Must do this week," "Can do next week").  
   - **Tools:** This can be as simple as sticky notes on a wall, a whiteboard, or digital tools like Trello (using lists for stages and cards for stories), Miro, or dedicated story mapping software. The visual and tactile nature of physical notes can be particularly engaging.  
4. **Reflect (GTD Principle):**  
   - **Weekly Review with a "Value Lens":** During your weekly review, don't just look at your task lists. Re-read your project user stories.  
     - Ask: "Does this still provide the value I anticipated?" "Is this 'so that...' still relevant and motivating?"  
     - This helps you prune tasks or reframe them if their perceived importance has genuinely changed, rather than just feeling "boring."  
5. **Engage (GTD Principle):**  
   - When you pick a task to do, quickly re-read its user story format. This micro-reaffirmation of purpose can be the nudge you need to initiate.

**Example: GTD Project "Organise Home Office" adapted:**

- **Traditional GTD Project:** Organise Home Office  
  - Tasks: Buy shelves, sort papers, declutter desk, set up filing system...  
- **GTD \+ User Story Approach:**  
  - **Project User Story (Epic):** "As a 'Focused Professional,' I want to create a calm, organised, and efficient home office so that I can work productively, reduce stress, and easily find what I need."  
  - **Task User Stories:**  
    - "As a 'Focused Professional,' I want to research and purchase suitable shelving units so that I can store books and materials neatly and accessibly."  
    - "As a 'Focused Professional,' I want to sort through all loose papers so that I can eliminate clutter and identify what needs to be filed or discarded."  
    - "As a 'Focused Professional,' I want to design and implement a simple filing system so that I can quickly retrieve important documents."  
    - "As a 'Focused Professional,' I want to declutter and arrange my desk space so that I have a clear area to concentrate and work comfortably."

**Addressing Your Specific Challenges:**

- **Task Initiation:** The explicit "so that..." provides immediate purpose, making it easier to see the benefit and start.  
- **Boring/Irrelevant Tasks:** If the "so that..." no longer resonates during your weekly review, the task *might* genuinely be less important, or you might need to reframe the benefit to reconnect with its value. This helps differentiate between ADHD-related motivational dips and a genuine change in priorities.  
- **GTD Project Planning:** User story mapping offers a more visual, narrative, and value-driven approach to project planning than just listing project support materials and next actions.

I think this hybrid approach has a strong chance of being effective for you. It leverages the robust framework of GTD while infusing it with the motivational and clarifying power of user stories, directly addressing the "why" that can be so crucial when dealing with ADHD. Start small, perhaps with one project, and see how it feels. Good luck\!

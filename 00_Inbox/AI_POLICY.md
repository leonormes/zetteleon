# AI Contribution Policy

This project welcomes contributions, including those authored with the assistance of AI tools. However, AI-generated pull requests must meet the following requirements:

## Requirements

1. **Prior Approval Required.** The pull request must link to an issue or discussion where the proposed solution has been approved by a maintainer. Do not submit AI-generated PRs without prior discussion — they will be closed without review.

2. **Self-Identification.** The pull request must clearly identify itself as AI-generated or AI-assisted, including the name of the tool or agent used (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Google Jules, Google Antigravity, etc.).

3. **PR Standards Apply.** The pull request must meet all the same standards as any other contribution (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)):
   - All CI checks must pass (tests, formatting, type checking).
   - UI changes must include a screenshot or screencast proving the feature works.
   - Changes must be compatible with both Desktop and Mobile.
   - The Obsidian API must be used where applicable — do not introduce custom implementations of functionality the platform already provides.
   - Documentation must be updated alongside code changes.

4. **Use the PR Template.** The pull request must use the repository's pull request template and complete all required checkboxes.

5. **Human Review.** The submitter is responsible for reviewing and understanding the AI-generated code before submitting. "The AI wrote it" is not an acceptable explanation for bugs, regressions, or code that doesn't follow project conventions.

## Agent Skills

This repository includes agent skill definitions in `.agents/skills/` that AI coding tools can use for context when contributing:

- **`code-review`** — Guidelines for reviewing code quality, correctness, and maintainability. Covers DRY, SOLID, error handling, performance, security, and TypeScript best practices.
- **`obsidian-plugin-development`** — Reference for the Obsidian TypeScript API, plugin lifecycle, UI patterns, vault operations, and common conventions used in this project.

AI agents should reference these skills when generating or reviewing code for this project.

## Enforcement

Pull requests that do not comply with this policy may be closed without feedback.

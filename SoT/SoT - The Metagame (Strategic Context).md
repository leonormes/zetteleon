## 1. Definition

The **Metagame** (or "Meta-game") is the strategic layer that operates *outside* or *beyond* the explicit rules of a competition or system. It involves manipulating the environment, context, psychology, and incentives to influence the outcome before the "game" is even played.

> [!definition] Metagame
> The use of out-of-game information, resources, or strategies to affect in-game decisions. It is the "game about the game."

## 2. Core Mechanisms

Metagame strategy relies on four primary levers:

1.  **Context Manipulation:** Changing the environment so that the standard optimal strategy becomes suboptimal.
2.  **Psychological Warfare:** Shaping the opponent's (or user's) perceptions and expectations to force errors.
3.  **Incentive Engineering:** Designing systems where the "winning move" is also the desired behavior (e.g., in business or gamification).
4.  **System Exploitation:** Identifying and leveraging the "physics" of the system (rules, physics engines, bureaucracies) rather than just playing within them.

## 3. Domains of Application

### A. Competitive Sports
-   **Tactics:** Referee management, disrupting opponent rhythm, "trash talk," strategic rule interpretation (e.g., "professional fouls").
-   **Goal:** To gain a marginal advantage that the raw mechanics of the sport do not explicitly provide.

### B. Business & Organizational Behavior
-   **Tactics:** "Office politics," shaping corporate culture, designing KPI structures, lobbying for regulatory changes.
-   **Goal:** To encourage desired outcomes (productivity, innovation) through environmental design rather than direct mandate.

### C. Gaming (Esports/Tabletop)
-   **Tactics:** Deck building (Magic: The Gathering), counter-picking heroes (Dota/LoL), studying patch notes to find broken mechanics.
-   **Goal:** To win at the "Select Screen" rather than relying solely on mechanical skill during the match.

## 4. Ethical Considerations

The Metagame often treads the line between "Smart Strategy" and "Unsportsmanlike Conduct."

-   **The Line:** Strategies that violate the *spirit* of the game while adhering to the *letter* of the rules are often considered "Cheese" or unethical (e.g., spawn camping).
-   **The Reality:** High-level competition *always* evolves into the metagame. To ignore it is to play a suboptimal game.

## 5. ProdOS Integration

In ProdOS, we apply Metagame thinking to **Productivity**:

-   **The Game:** Completing tasks.
-   **The Metagame:** Designing the environment (Context) so that completing tasks is the path of least resistance.
    -   *Example:* [[SoT - The Honeyman Method (Adaptive Routines)]] is a metagame strategy to "hack" the energy levels of an ADHD brain.
    -   *Example:* [[SoT - Temporal Management (Blocking and Boxing)]] manipulates the "Time" variable to force efficiency (Parkinson's Law).

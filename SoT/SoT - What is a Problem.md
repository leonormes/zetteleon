## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Definition
> A **Problem** is a specific structural relationship between an agent and their environment characterized by a **Gap** plus **Uncertainty**.
>
> It exists effectively only when three components are present simultaneously:
> 1.  **Current State:** Where you are now (Reality).
> 2.  **Desired State:** Where you want to be (Goal).
> 3.  **The Gap (Uncertainty):** You do not immediately know the transformation path to move from current to desired.

If the path is known, it is not a problem; it is a **Task**.

## 2. Core Components & Logic

### A. The "Gap + Uncertainty" Model

From logic and cognitive science (Newell & Simon), a problem is defined by **imperfect knowledge**.

- **Scenario A:** You are hungry -> You have an apple -> You eat it.
    - *Analysis:* Gap exists, but Method is known. **This is a Task.**
- **Scenario B:** You are hungry -> You have no food and no money -> You don't know how to eat.
    - *Analysis:* Gap exists, and Method is unknown. **This is a Problem.**

### B. Systems Thinking Perspective

In systems thinking, a problem is not an isolated "bad event" but an **emergent property** or dysfunction of a system. It is a "System of Interest" where interacting components produce an output that deviates from the desired norm, and the causal mechanism is not fully understood.

## 3. Productivity Framework: The Distinctions

Precise definitions prevent "busy work" (treating problems like tasks) and frustration (treating constraints like problems).

| Concept | Definition | Key Characteristic | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Situation** | A neutral snapshot of reality. | No "Desired State" implies no problem. | **Acceptance** or Monitoring. |
| **Goal** | The targeted Desired State. | Defines the destination, implies no difficulty. | **Direction Setting**. |
| **Task** | A unit of work with a *known path*. | **Zero Uncertainty**. Can be executed immediately. | **Execution** (Do it). |
| **Problem** | A Goal with **Resistance/Uncertainty**. | **High Uncertainty**. The path must be discovered. | **Solution Design** (Figure it out). |

### The "Knowledge Gap" Test

To identify what you are facing, ask: **"Do I know exactly what step to take next?"**

- **YES:** You are procrastinating on a **Task**.
- **NO:** You have a **Problem**. You must switch modes from "Doing" to "Solving" (gathering info, designing a path).

## 4. Constraints: Boundaries, Not Problems

A **Constraint** is a condition that bounds the "solution space." It is a variable that cannot be changed within the current scope.

- **Hard Constraints:** Binary limits (e.g., Physics, Laws, "Budget = $0").
- **Soft Constraints:** Preferences (e.g., "Finish by Friday").

**The Relationship:**
- **Problems** are the search for coordinates (the solution).
- **Constraints** are the edges of the map (the search space).
- *Insight:* Constraints are helpful filters that reduce the infinite possibilities of a problem.

**The Control Test:**
To distinguish a Problem from a Constraint, use the 1-Minute Decision Tree:

> "Can I, my team, or my boss change this factor right now?"
> - **YES:** It is a **Problem**. Solve it.
> - **NO:** It is a **Constraint**. Optimize *around* it.

## 5. Practical Application

### Structuring Problem-Solving

Before attempting to solve, explicitly define the three components to avoid "Solutioneering" (jumping to fixes):

1.  **Current State:** (e.g., "Conversion is 1%")
2.  **Desired State:** (e.g., "Conversion is 3%")
3.  **The Gap:** (e.g., "We don't know *why* users drop off.")
    - *Implication:* The next step is **Discovery** (Analytics), not **Action** (Redesign).

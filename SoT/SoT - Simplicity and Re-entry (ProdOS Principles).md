## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Simplicity and Re-entry
> ProdOS prioritizes **radical simplicity** and **frictionless re-entry** to enable sustained "writing to think" over complex, un-used systems. The goal is to lower the activation energy for creative work by systematically externalizing the mental model and minimizing decision points.

## 2. The Problem: Over-Complication as Procrastination

The desire for a "perfect" or "singing and dancing PKM" often leads to system-building becoming a form of productive procrastination. This "meta-work" provides dopamine from organization but avoids the core task of deep thinking and knowledge synthesis.

-   **Failure Mode:** Systems are built but never *used* for their intended purpose.
-   **The Cost:** The mental model of a complex system is forgotten upon re-entry, leading to "starting fresh" loops and abandoning big ideas.

## 3. ProdOS Solution: The Re-entry Designed System

ProdOS is explicitly designed to counter over-complication and facilitate re-engagement with complex thoughts.

### A. Externalized Mental Model

The system acts as an "Extended Mind" by offloading the burden of recall from internal working memory.

-   **Protocol:** Every significant thought process is initiated and maintained in a **[[SoT - PRODOS - Knowledge Synthesis (Thinking)#Externalizing the Mental Model: The SESSION Note Protocol|SESSION Note]]** or a **HEAD Note**.
-   **Explicit Context:** The `Now, Next, Why` structure ensures that the core mental model, next steps, and intent are captured *at the point of exit*, ready for instant reload.

### B. Frictionless Capture & Re-entry

The easier it is to start and resume, the more likely deep work will occur.

-   **Minimal Setup:** Use simple Markdown files. Avoid proprietary formats.
-   **Direct Access:** Store notes as local files (`Obsidian`), ensuring flexibility and future-proofing.
-   **Intentional Re-entry Points:** Deliberately create mechanisms (like "incubator blocks" or explicit "Next" steps) to guide future self.

### C. Embrace Iteration over Perfection

The "perfect" system is an illusion. Focus on getting to "good enough" and then iterating.

-   **"Improve 1%" Mindset:** Small, consistent improvements are prioritized over grand, unimplemented designs.
-   **[[SoT - Process Primacy (Systems Over Goals)]]:** The goal is the continuous process of thinking and acting, not a static "perfect" knowledge base.

## 4. Operational Principles for Simplicity

1.  **"Just Write to Think":** The primary act is putting thoughts down. Linking and organizing are secondary, LLM-assisted processes.
2.  **Date-Stamped Entries:** Simple chronological markers ensure discoverability without complex tagging.
3.  **Explicit Metadata:** Use YAML frontmatter to add clear, future-proof context (e.g., `status: incubator`, `purpose: return-to`).
4.  **"Incubator Blocks":** Explicitly mark sections of notes for future elaboration.

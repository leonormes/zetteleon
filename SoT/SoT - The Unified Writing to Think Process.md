## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Definition
> **Writing to Think** is the process of using writing not as a tool for communication (Type A), but as a tool for discovery (Type B).
>
> The act of externalizing thought forces linearity, exposes gaps in logic, and allows for objective examination. It is the primary mechanism for transforming **Exploratory Writing** (messy, raw) into **Explanatory Knowledge** (structured, clear).

## 2. The Four Philosophical Pillars

This process synthesizes four distinct philosophies into a single cognitive workflow:

1.  **Annie Murphy Paul (The Extended Mind):** Thinking *outside* the brain using movement and space.
2.  **Natalie Goldberg (Writing Down the Bones):** Accessing raw, energetic "first thoughts" by bypassing the internal critic.
3.  **William Zinsser (On Writing Well):** The craftsman's toolset for refining raw thought into clear prose (clarity = understanding).
4.  **Joe Moran (First You Write a Sentence):** The artist's focus on rhythm and generosity in the sentence itself.

## 3. The Six-Stage Workflow

### Stage 0: Prepare (The Extended Mind)
*   **Goal:** Prime the mind for insight.
*   **Action:** Move your body (walk), engage with nature, or tune into interoception (gut feelings). Do not start at the screen.

### Stage 1: Generate (The Goldberg Layer)
*   **Goal:** Capture raw energy.
*   **Action:** Timed writing sprints. Keep the hand moving. Don't cross out. Lose control. Bypassing the internal editor allows the subconscious to speak.

### Stage 2: Clarify (The Zinsser Layer)
*   **Goal:** Strip the clutter to find the truth.
*   **Action:** Prune qualifiers ("a bit," "sort of"). Replace passive verbs with active ones. If you can't write it clearly, you don't understand it yet.

### Stage 3: Understand (The Writing to Learn Layer)
*   **Goal:** Demystify complexity.
*   **Action:** "Reason your way to the meaning." Write sequentially: "This means X, which implies Y..." Use the act of writing to expose gaps in your own logic.

### Stage 4: Connect (The Zettelkasten Layer)
*   **Goal:** Integrate the new thought.
*   **Action:** Link the clarified note to existing concepts. How does this contradict, support, or extend what you already know?

### Stage 5: Synthesize (The Outcome Layer)
*   **Goal:** Build the map.
*   **Action:** Create **Structure Notes** or **MOCs**. Zoom out to see the larger argument forming from the atomic notes.

## 4. The Core Distinction: Type A vs. Type B Writing

*   **Type A (Explanatory):** Writing for an audience. Polished, linear, authoritative. (The final Product).
*   **Type B (Exploratory):** Writing for yourself. Messy, recursive, questioning. (The Process).
*   **The Rule:** Do not judge Type B writing by Type A standards. You must allow the mess to find the meaning.

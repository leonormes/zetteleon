## 1. The Core Tension: Purpose vs. Features

Most productivity systems fail for ADHD users not because the features are bad, but because the **purpose** is misaligned.

-   **The Trap:** Confusing "features" (linking notes, organizing folders) with "outcomes" (reducing anxiety, completing tasks).
-   **The Result:** The system becomes a "Displacement Activity"—a way to feel productive (dopamine from organizing) without actually solving the executive dysfunction (closing open loops).

## 2. Failure Mode A: The "Shoulder Massage" (Zettelkasten)

> [!analogy] The Analogy
> Using Zettelkasten to cure ADHD is like getting a shoulder massage for a sore calf. The massage feels good, but it doesn't treat the injury.

-   **System Intent:** Zettelkasten is designed for **Public Output** (publishing papers). It thrives on open-ended complexity.
-   **ADHD Need:** The ADHD brain needs **Internal Input** (Activation Energy) and **Closed Loops** (Stopping points).
-   **The Mismatch:** Zettelkasten is an "infinite game" with no definition of "Done." For an ADHD brain, this lack of closure creates anxiety, leading to abandonment.

## 3. Failure Mode B: The Monotony Trap (Hyperfixation-Burnout)

-   **The Cycle:**
    1.  **Hyperfixation:** High dopamine during setup/learning of a new system.
    2.  **Maintenance:** The novelty fades; using the system becomes "admin."
    3.  **Burnout:** The brain craves new novelty and abandons the "boring" system.
-   **The Reframe:** You didn't fail the system; the system failed to provide the necessary stimulation.

## 4. Failure Mode C: The Graze vs. Process Gap

-   **The Problem:** I'm "grazing" on thoughts (low-effort capture/collection) instead of "processing" them (high-effort refinement/synthesis).
-   **The Tension:** I love *building* the system (Architecting) but resist *operating* it (Janitorial Work).
-   **The Constraint:** Insufficient **Activation Energy** to switch contexts from passive intake to active "Thinking Mode" and perform deep processing. This leads to system abandonment despite frictionless capture.

## 5. The PRODOS Solution: System as Prosthetic

PRODOS is designed to avoid these traps by redefining the "Customer":

1.  **Cognitive Debugging > Publishing:** We use notes to "debug" our own thinking (fixing mental models), not to build a library for others. A note is "Done" when the confusion is resolved.
2.  **Simulation > Storage:** The system is a "Runtime Environment" for simulating tasks (reducing anxiety), not a "Database" for storing facts.
3.  **Novelty Injection:** The "Ignition Protocol" (Mystery, Spite, Urgency) is engineered to manufacture the dopamine required to keep the system running.
4.  **Activation Bridge:** Implement "5-Minute Workbench" rules or dopamine-pairing strategies to lower the activation energy for context switching and processing.

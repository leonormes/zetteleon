## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Definition
> **"Think like a man of action, act like a man of thought."** (Henri Bergson)
>
> This principle bridges the gap between Analysis Paralysis (Thinking without Acting) and Recklessness (Acting without Thinking). It demands that all thinking must converge on a **Minimum Viable Action (MVA)**, and all action must be followed by reflection.

## 2. The Core Conflict

*   **The "Thinker" Trap:** You fall into "Encyclopedia Building"—collecting ideas with no endpoint. Thinking becomes a form of procrastination.
*   **The "Actor" Trap:** You react impulsively without a plan, leading to wasted effort or "motion" rather than progress.

## 3. The Four Protocols

### A. Shrink the Thought (The Forcing Function)
Thinking must be decisive, not exploratory.
*   **The Question:** "What is the *single, specific action* this thinking is supposed to lead to?"
*   **The Effect:** If you can't answer, you are procrastinating. Stop thinking.

### B. Define the Action (The MVA)
"Thoughtful Action" does not mean "Big Action." It means "Intentional Action."
*   **The Method:** Identify the **Minimum Viable Action (MVA)**.
    *   *Not:* "Learn about nutrition."
    *   *Is:* "Write 'Buy one book' on the list."
*   **The Why:** Small actions bypass the "Wall of Awful" (initiation paralysis).

### C. Time-Bound Containers (The Constraint)
Thinking expands to fill the time available.
*   **The Rule:** 15 minutes to Plan -> 5 minutes to Do.
*   **The Hard Stop:** When the timer rings, thinking ends. You must execute the best *current* hypothesis.

### D. Act First, Then Think (The Feedback Loop)
Real-world data beats theoretical models.
*   **The Cycle:** Guess -> Do -> Reflect.
*   **The Shift:** Instead of thinking to find the *perfect* action, take a *good-enough* action and then "think" about the result. This turns "failure" into "data."

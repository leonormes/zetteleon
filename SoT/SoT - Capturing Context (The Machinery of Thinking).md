## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Definition
> **Context Capture** is the practice of recording the *process* of thought, not just the *product*.
>
> A useful note does not just state "X is true"; it captures **why** you believe X, **what** triggered the thought, **how** you felt about it, and **what** assumptions underpin it. It preserves the "Cognitive State" for future re-entry.

## 2. The Core Problem: The "Crystallization Error"

Traditional note-taking fails because it commits the **Crystallization Error**: freezing a dynamic, living thought process into a static, dead conclusion.

-   **The Symptom:** Notes feel disconnected and "generic," like Wikipedia entries.
-   **The Cause:** You stripped away the **Context** (the problem you were solving), the **Emotion** (surprise, frustration), and the **Reasoning** (the path you took).
-   **The Result:** You cannot "re-load" the mental model later because you lost the breadcrumbs.

## 3. The Solution: Capturing "The Machinery"

To build an external brain, you must capture the machinery of your thinking, not just the output.

### The "Why-How-What" Layer

Every significant note should include:

1.  **Why-Now:** What specific problem or emotion triggered this note *today*?
2.  **Why-Me:** How does this contradict or confirm *my* existing beliefs?
3.  **Future-Hook:** When will Future-Me need this? (e.g., "Useful for debugging auth service").

### The Note Types (Thinking Scaffolds)

Stop treating all notes as "Information." Categorize them by their cognitive role:

| Type | Definition | Structure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model Note** | A framework for prediction. | "Analogy", "When it works", "Where it breaks". |
| **Move Note** | A specific tactical pattern. | "When in situation S, do move M, to get outcome O." |
| **Moment Note** | A specific event or story. | "What I thought before", "What happened", "What changed". |
| **Delta Note** | A record of learning. | "Previous Belief" vs "New Belief" + Evidence. |

## 4. Practical Protocols

### A. The "Thinking Snapshot" (5-Minute Protocol)

When an insight strikes, do not write a textbook. Write a Snapshot:

-   **Question:** What was I asking?
-   **Hunch:** What is my hypothesis?
-   **Model:** If I had to name this mechanism, what is it?
-   **Next Time:** How do I use this?

### B. The "Voice-to-Thinking" Pipeline

Speaking often captures context better than writing.

1.  **Record:** Talk out the problem for 2 minutes.
2.  **Distill:** Listen once. Extract *only* the Model, the Example, and the Tension.
3.  **Discard:** Delete the audio. Keep the distilled "Machinery."

### C. The "No Orphan Notes" Rule

Every note must have an **Anchor**:

-   Relates to **Project**: [Name]
-   Relates to **Decision**: [Name]
-   Relates to **Question**: [Name]

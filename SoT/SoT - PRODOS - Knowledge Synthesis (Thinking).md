## 1. Definition: What is Thinking

In ProdOS, "Thinking" is defined biologically and functionally:

> [!definition] The Simulation Engine
> Thinking is the **offline simulation of action**. It is an evolutionary mechanism designed to **decouple** stimulus from response, creating a buffer where potential futures can be modeled, tested, and discarded without real-world consequences.
>
> *Purpose:* **Entropy Minimisation.** To reduce uncertainty and surprise by predicting outcomes.

## 2. The Problem: The "Open Loop" Bug

The human brain uses 20% of the body's energy to run these simulations. When thinking is not "grounded" (output to a stable medium), the simulation loops indefinitely, consuming energy without producing resolution. This is experienced as **Anxiety** or **Overthinking**.

**ProdOS solves this by Externalizing the Simulation.**
-   **Internal RAM:** Expensive, volatile, prone to looping (Anxiety).
-   **External Disk (Obsidian):** Cheap, stable, linear (Progress).

## 3. The Thinking Workflow (Refinement)

To transform "Noise" (Anxiety) into "Signal" (Knowledge/Action), we use the **Refinement Loop**:

1.  **Capture (The Dump):** Get the simulation out of the brain. Write it down in a `HEAD` note. (See [[SoT - PRODOS (System Architecture)#A. HEAD Notes (The Workbench)|HEAD Note Definition]]).
2.  **Decouple (The Pause):** Identify the *Trigger* (Spark) and the *Model* (Hypothesis).
3.  **Simulate (The Work):** Manipulate the variables in the note, not the head.
4.  **Resolve (The Output):**
    -   **If Actionable:** Create a **Next Test** (Action).
    -   **If Insight:** Synthesize into an **SoT** (Knowledge).

## 4. Synthesis: From Volatile to Stable

Knowledge Synthesis is the process of promoting "verified simulations" into the Canon.

-   **HEAD Notes** are the *Lab Experiments*.
-   **SoT Notes** are the *Published Papers*.

We do not keep every thought. We keep only the **Models** that have been verified to accurately predict reality.

## 1. Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Definition
> The **Four Laws of Behavior Change** are a practical framework for building good habits and breaking bad ones. They map directly to the four stages of the **Habit Loop** (Cue, Craving, Response, Reward), providing a lever for intervention at each stage of automaticity.

---

## 2. The Habit Loop

All habits proceed through four distinct stages in a feedback loop. Failure at any stage prevents the habit from forming.

1.  **Cue:** The trigger that initiates the behavior (notices the reward).
2.  **Craving:** The motivational force or desire (wants the reward).
3.  **Response:** The actual behavior or action performed (obtains the reward).
4.  **Reward:** The end goal that satisfies the craving (teaches the brain).

## 3. The Four Laws (How to Create a Good Habit)

To build a habit, you must solve the problem of "how to act" at each stage.

| Stage | Law | Principle | Actionable Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cue** | **1st Law** | **Make It Obvious** | **Implementation Intentions:** "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]." <br> **Habit Stacking:** "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]." <br> **Environment Design:** Make cues visible (e.g., fruit on the counter). |
| **Craving** | **2nd Law** | **Make It Attractive** | **Temptation Bundling:** Pair an action you *want* to do with one you *need* to do. <br> **Social Norms:** Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. |
| **Response** | **3rd Law** | **Make It Easy** | **Reduce Friction:** Decrease the number of steps. <br> **Prime the Environment:** Prepare tools in advance. <br> **2-Minute Rule:** "When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do." |
| **Reward** | **4th Law** | **Make It Satisfying** | **Immediate Reinforcement:** Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit. <br> **Habit Tracking:** visual proof of progress. |

---

## 4. The Inversions (How to Break a Bad Habit)

To eliminate a habit, you invert the laws to increase friction or remove the reward.

| Stage | Inversion | Principle | Actionable Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cue** | **Inversion of 1st** | **Make It Invisible** | **Remove the Cue:** Hide junk food, delete apps, put phone in another room. |
| **Craving** | **Inversion of 2nd** | **Make It Unattractive** | **Reframe Mindset:** Highlight the benefits of avoiding the habit. |
| **Response** | **Inversion of 3rd** | **Make It Difficult** | **Increase Friction:** Add steps (e.g., take batteries out of the remote). <br> **Commitment Device:** Restrict future choices to the one you want. |
| **Reward** | **Inversion of 4th** | **Make It Unsatisfying** | **Accountability Partner:** Ask someone to watch your behavior. <br> **Habit Contract:** Make the costs of your bad habits public and painful. |

## 5. Core Principles & Rules

### The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change

> "What gets rewarded is repeated. What gets punished is avoided."
>
> *Crucial Detail:* The reward or punishment must be **immediate**. The brain prioritizes immediate outcomes over delayed ones (Hyperbolic Discounting).

### Implementation Intentions (The 1st Law Power Tool)

Research shows that vague intentions ("I will exercise more") fail. Specific plans ("I will run at 7am in the park") succeed because they automate the **Cue**.

- **Formula:** `I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].`

### Habit Stacking (The Diderot Effect)

Leverages the "Synaptic Pruning" of existing habits to build new ones.

- **Formula:** `After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].`

## 6. Practical Application Plans

### Developer Example
- **Goal:** Code for 1 hour daily.
- **Law 1 (Obvious):** "I will open VS Code at 8:00 AM." (Implementation Intention). Sticky note on monitor (Environment).
- **Law 2 (Attractive):** "I can listen to my favorite podcast only while coding." (Temptation Bundling).
- **Law 3 (Easy):** "I will code for just 2 minutes." (2-Minute Rule). Keep laptop charger plugged in (Prime Environment).
- **Law 4 (Satisfying):** "After I commit code, I will log 'Success' in my tracker." (Immediate Reinforcement).

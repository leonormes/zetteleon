A precise word for this concept is parsimonious. In psychology and neuroscience, the brain is often described as *parsimonious* in its use of energy and effort—meaning it tends to use the least amount necessary, sometimes at the expense of accuracy or completeness.

Other words and phrases that capture this idea include:

- Minimizing (as in "the brain is a minimizing system")
- Economical (though this is usually positive, it can imply stinginess)
- Frugal (suggests careful or sparing use, sometimes excessively so)
- Conservative (in the sense of conserving resources)
- Effort-averse (emphasizing avoidance of effort)
- Cognitive miserliness (a term in psychology for the brain’s tendency to avoid expending effortful thought)

But parsimonious is the most commonly used term in scientific literature to describe the brain’s tendency to use as little energy and effort as possible, sometimes to the detriment of optimal outcomes.

For example:

*"The human brain is parsimonious, often defaulting to energy-saving shortcuts even when they lead to errors or biases."*

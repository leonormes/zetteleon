## 1. Old Definitive Statement

> [!definition] Definition
> PRODOS is a **cognitive operating system** that utilizes a **Tri-State Routing Logic** to direct inputs into three distinct processing engines: **Action** (Kinetic), **Storage** (Static), or **Synthesis** (Dynamic).
>
> It functions as a "Microservices Architecture" for the mind, treating **Obsidian as the IDE** (Source of Truth) and **Todoist as the Runtime** (Execution Engine)

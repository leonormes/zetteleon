## HEAD - Integrating Rocks into ProdOS

### The Spark

Derived from ProdOS Task: "Add rocks to prodOS".

I need a way to track "Rocks" (90-day/Quarterly Goals) as defined in EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System).

### My Current Model

Rocks sit between "Vision" (SoT) and "Projects" (Active).

Currently, ProdOS has `Projects` and `SoT`s. Rocks are likely a specific *type* of Project or a container for Projects.

They need high visibility.

### The Tension
- **Visibility:** Projects are often hidden in folders. Rocks need to be "in my face" to ensure quarterly alignment.
- **Connection:** How does a Rock relate to the daily tasks?
- **Review:** How do I review progress on Rocks vs. just ticking off tasks?

### The Next Test
- [ ] Define a "Rock" attribute in the Project Template (or a separate Rock Template).
- [ ] Create a "Quarterly Dashboard" note that lists the current 3-5 Rocks.
- [ ] Link one active Project to a Rock and visualize the hierarchy.

> [!abstract] The Spark
> I realized my previous assumption—that "work causes anxiety"—might be wrong. It is possible that **"Not knowing what the work IS"** is the actual source of the anxiety. She is paralyzed by the *Fog of War*, not the enemy itself.

## 🎓 Mode: Learning / Understanding

> [!question] The Epistemic Gap
> - **I understand:** When I have a clear roadmap, I feel calm (even if the work is hard).
> - **I am confused by:** Why my attempts to *give* her the roadmap (lecturing) increased her anxiety instead of reducing it.
> - **My Hypothesis:** The "Roadmap" I gave her was too big (Map of the World). It looked like *more* data to process. She needs a "Next Turn" instruction, not a cartography lesson.

## 🧠 My Current Model (The "Infinite Loop" Theory)
- **The Mechanism of Anxiety:** Anxiety is often the brain's reaction to **Ambiguity**. When the path is unclear, the brain spins up multiple simulations to predict every possible disaster. This consumes 100% of CPU (Executive Function).
- **The Solution (Clarity):** Defining the task kills the simulations.
    - *Vague Task:* "Do Photography Coursework" $\rightarrow$ Brain simulates failing, being judged, not knowing software, missing deadlines. (High Anxiety).
    - *Defined Task:* "Find 3 photos of shadows." $\rightarrow$ Brain simulates looking at photos. (Low Anxiety).
- **The Reframing:** Structure is not a "Cage" to force her to work; Structure is a **"Handrail"** to stop her from falling.

## ⚔️ The Tension (The Delivery Mechanism)
- **My Instinct:** "Here is the full specification of the GCSE." (I think I'm giving clarity; she hears "Here is a mountain").
- **Her Need:** "Just tell me I'm safe for the next 10 minutes."
- **The Paradox:** To reduce anxiety, I must provide structure, *but* the act of explaining the structure triggers the "Overwhelm" response.

## 🧪 Next Test (The "Flashlight" Protocol)
*Experiment: Provide clarity on ONLY the immediate step, hiding the rest of the mountain.*

- [ ] **Action:** Sit with her and say: *"Forget the GCSE. We are just going to make **one** folder on your desktop called 'Unit 1'. That is the only goal for today."*
- [ ] **Hypothesis:** If I reduce the scope to a 2-minute "Win," her shoulders will physically drop (Relief).
- [ ] **Observation:** Does defining the *container* (the folder) reduce the fear of the *content*?

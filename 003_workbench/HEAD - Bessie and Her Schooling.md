Every day, she just sits in the dark room and plays games on the computer. This is depressing. I feel she spends too much time doing games. The same game.

She is not learning for her GCSEs.

She is doing what she wants and avoiding what she doesn't want. [[HEAD - I think this is bad experience]]. She is learning to avoid any work or stress. But taking the easiest option every time doesn't lead to an easy life.

It might seem harmless to just sit playing games but these are her formative years. She is learning helplessness. She is learning that if she would rather not do it she doesn't have to. We are re-enforcing the idea that she should only do what she feels like doing. These are all problems I suffer from. Just because I do something doesn't make it right.

Is it loving to just give her what she wants and to avoid conflict?

Zofja has her view which affect the responses she has to Bessie's behaviour. I think she is too reactive and not having a level-headed response.

> Bessie is sitting in the dark playing the same game daily. She is ignoring GCSEs. I feel depressed watching it because it mirrors my own struggles with avoidance.

## 🧠 My Current Model (The Diagnosis)
- **Observation:** She avoids work to play games.
- **Assumption A (The Behaviour):** This is "[[HEAD - Learned Helplessness]]." She is training herself to choose the easy path.
- **Assumption B (The Projection):** She is doing this because she is like me (inheriting my problems).
- **Assumption C (The Parenting):** By avoiding conflict, we are reinforcing the behaviour. "Keeping the peace" is actually "Enabling."
- assumption D: When I try to explain things out goes on one ear and it the other. Bessie didn't like just listening. Maybe she prefers doing to learn [[HEAD - But My Brain Understands by Doing]]

## ⚔️ The Tension (The Conflict)
- **Internal:** I want her to have agency, but I am afraid to enforce rules because I fear conflict/rejection.
- **External:** Zofja is "Reactive" (High Entropy response), whereas I want a "Level-headed" (Structured response). These two systems are fighting, sending mixed signals to Bessie.
- **The Gap:** We want "Agency" (her choosing to work), but we are considering "Coercion" (forcing her to work). These are opposites.

## 🧪 Next Test (The Experiment)
- [To be defined in Step 3]
I could try 'explaining' my ideas in a different way. Show her an example. Find a way to start the portfolio? Set up the photo workflow.

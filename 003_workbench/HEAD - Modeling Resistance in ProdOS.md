## HEAD - Modeling Resistance in ProdOS

### The Spark

Derived from ProdOS Task: "include the resistence idea in prodOS".

"The Resistance" (Steven Pressfield) is the force that prevents us from doing our most important work. I need to explicitly model this friction.

### My Current Model

I treat all tasks as "Physics" (Time/Energy). I ignore "Psychology" (Fear/Resistance).

High resistance tasks often get skipped for "easier" tasks, even if they are high priority.

Identifying resistance might change how I schedule or break down a task.

### The Tension
- **Subjectivity:** Resistance is a feeling, not a hard metric. How do I record it?
- **Actionability:** If I label a task "High Resistance", what does the system *do* about it?
- **Avoidance:** Will labeling it just make me avoid it more?

### The Next Test
- [ ] Add a `resistance` field (Low, Med, High) to the Project or Task frontmatter.
- [ ] Create a view/query that highlights "High Resistance" items and suggests a "Micro-Step" breakdown strategy for them.

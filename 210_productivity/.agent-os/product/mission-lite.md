# Product Mission (Lite)

ProdOS is an AI-driven productivity operating system featuring a conversational "GTD Co-Pilot" that helps knowledge workers with ADHD achieve stress-free productivity by intelligently suggesting the next best action through real-time synthesis of tasks, notes, and priorities using multi-agent orchestration.

ProdOS serves ADHD knowledge workers and platform engineers who need intelligent next-action recommendations without decision paralysis. Unlike traditional productivity tools that present overwhelming task lists, ProdOS features a conversational AI co-pilot powered by specialized agents (MasterAgent, RetrievalAgent, ReasoningAgent) that synthesizes information from all connected systems (Todoist, Jira, Obsidian) to provide contextually appropriate suggestions with clear reasoning through simple queries like "What's next?" or "Show me low-energy tasks for 30 minutes."

## HEAD - Clarifying Project Stages

### The Spark

Derived from ProdOS Task: "ProdOS should help clarify stage".

Projects often languish because it's unclear if they are "Incubating", "Active", "Blocked", or "Someday".

### My Current Model

I likely have too many "Active" projects that are actually stalled.

I need clear criteria for "State Transitions".

A project shouldn't be "Active" unless it has a defined Next Action and a recent review.

### The Tension
- **Definition:** What exactly separates "Incubation" from "Active"?
- **Limit:** Should I enforce a WIP (Work In Progress) limit on "Active" projects?
- **Visuals:** How do I visualize these stages in the file explorer or dashboard?

### The Next Test
- [ ] Define the 4-5 core stages (e.g., Inbox, Incubation, Active, Maintenance, Archive).
- [ ] Write the "Exit Criteria" for Incubation (e.g., "Must have a 'Why' and a 'First Step'").
- [ ] Update 3 existing project notes to reflect these new stages.

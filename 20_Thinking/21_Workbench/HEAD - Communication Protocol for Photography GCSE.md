> [!abstract] The Spark
> I tried to explain the "Structure of the GCSE" to her yesterday, assuming that if she understood the *framework*, she would take ownership. Instead, she physically "shut down" (glazed eyes, silence). My attempt to help is actually blocking her.

## 🕷️ Mode: Debugging / Problem Solving

> [!failure] The Gap
> - **Current State ($S_c$):** I broadcast high-bandwidth structural information (Lecturing). She receives it as "Noise" or "Pressure" and disengages. Output = Zero Ownership.
> - **Desired State ($S_d$):** She queries me for help when stuck. She maintains the mental model of the project herself. Output = Proactive Ownership.
> - **The Gap ($\Delta$):** I lack a communication protocol that transfers *agency* without transferring *anxiety*.
> - **Constraints:** I cannot "make" her interested. I cannot change her processing speed. I must work *with* her current executive function limits.

## 🧠 My Current Model (The Diagnosis)
- **The "Architect's Fallacy":** I assume she needs the *Blueprint* (The Syllabus Structure) before she can lay the first brick.
- **The Reality:** For an overwhelmed teenage brain, the Blueprint is terrifying. It looks like a mountain. She shuts down because she can't see the path, only the height.
- **The "Lecture" Mechanism:** When I explain "what she needs to do," I am taking the *cognitive load* of planning away from her. I am doing the thinking; she is just the hard drive. Ownership requires *her* to do the thinking.
- **Hypothesis:** She doesn't need a Lecturer; she needs a **Rubber Duck**. She needs me to sit there and ask dumb questions so *she* has to explain the plan to *me*.

## ⚔️ The Tension (Conflict)
- **My Instinct:** To provide clarity by explaining everything perfectly (Top-Down).
- **Her Need:** To build clarity by discovering one piece at a time (Bottom-Up).
- **Conflict:** By satisfying my need for order (explaining the structure), I am violating her need for safety (manageable chunks).

## 🧪 Next Test (The "Co-Pilot" Protocol)
*Experiment: Invert the flow of information.*

- [ ] **Action:** The "Ignorant Client" Game.
    - Instead of explaining the GCSE structure, I will say: *"I'm confused about what the exam board actually wants. Can you show me one photo you like, and we figure out why it gets marks?"*
- [ ] **Rule:** I am forbidden from uttering a declarative sentence. I may only ask questions. (e.g., *"What happens if you do X?"* rather than *"You should do X"*).
- [ ] **Metric:** Does she speak more words than me during the session? (Target: >50% her).

It sounds like you are dealing with a heavy burden, but identifying it as "Resistance" is a crucial first step. In the framework of Steven Pressfield and the other authors provided, Resistance is not a personal flaw or a symptom of ADHD alone; it is an objective, active force of nature that aims to stop anyone trying to do creative or difficult work [1, 2].

Here is the direct advice from the texts on overcoming Resistance when you are stuck in chronic avoidance:

**1. Start Before You Are Ready**
The most critical instruction is to stop preparing. Do not research, do not outline, and do not "get your ducks in a row" [3, 4]. Resistance feeds on the time you spend getting ready. You must act immediately, even if you feel unqualified or terrified [5]. As Pressfield writes, "Don't think. Act. We can always revise and revisit once we've acted" [6].

**2. Turn "Pro"**
You must shift your mindset from an amateur to a professional.
-   **Amateurs** wait for inspiration or for the "right" feeling to start. They identify too closely with the work and are paralyzed by the fear of failure [7, 8].
-   **Professionals** show up every day, no matter what. They understand that the work is a job. They do not wait for motivation; they sit down and do the work because they are committed to the craft, not just the fun parts [9].

**3. Ignore the "Chatter"**
Your brain will generate endless excuses (rationalizations) for why you shouldn't work right now. This "chatter" is Resistance manifesting as logic [10]. It will tell you that you are too tired, that you need to clean the house first, or that you have ADHD and *can't* focus. You must recognize this voice as the enemy and ignore it completely [11].

**4. Use "The Process"**
When the task feels too big (which triggers paralysis), switch to "The Process." Do not think about the finished product or the outcome. Focus exclusively on the smallest immediate task in front of you—finishing a single rep, a single sentence, or a single email [12].

**5. Mechanical Tricks**
-   **The Pomodoro Technique:** Set a timer for 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5-minute break. This breaks the intimidation of a long workday [13].
-   **Start at the End:** If you are stuck on how to begin, figure out the ending or the final output first, then work backward [14].

Does looking at your procrastination as an external enemy ("Resistance") rather than a personal failure change how you feel about starting?

### 🛑 The Compile (Exit Strategy)
*When the thinking stops, extract the value and archive this note.*

- [ ] **The Next Test:** (What is the binary Pass/Fail action?)
- [ ] **The Update:** (Did I update the relevant SoT?) `[[Link SoT Here]]`

---

### 🚀 The Tri-State Output (Router)
*Where does this thinking go next? Pick one path.*

> **Path A: Kinetic (Action)**
> *I figured it out. I just need to do it.*
> - [ ] **Task:** (Write the binary Next Action here) `-> Send to Todoist`

> **Path B: Static (Storage)**
> *I learned a fact / defined a spec. No action needed.*
> - [ ] **SoT Update:** (What did I learn?) `-> Merge into [[SoT - Topic]]`

> **Path C: Dynamic (Still Thinking)**
> *I am pausing this thread. Serialize state to resume later.*
>
> 1. [ ] **The Save State:** (Write 1 sentence: "I stopped at X, the very next step is Y")
>    - *Constraint: If you don't write this, you fail the 60-Second Restore Test.*
> 2. [ ] **The Pointer:** (Create Todoist Task with Link) `-> Schedule for [Date]`
> 3. [ ] **TTL Check:** (Is this the 3rd resume? If yes, refactor to Project).

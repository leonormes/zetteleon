This relates to the fact that Bessie is learning to avoid things she doesn't like. She is avoiding life and avoiding challenges. I think that procrastination is a debilitating problem. If she learns to deal with stress and negative feels with avoidance she might not get the most from life.

The avoidance is a coping mechanism and can be successful depending on your tolerance for not achieving the things you actually want.

She has anxiety as if she has stronger feelings. But how do we know they are not the same feelings as others have but others have learned better ways of dealing with it?

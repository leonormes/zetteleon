## The Spark

> [!abstract] The Spark (Contextual Wrapper)
Received an email outlining the mandatory annual FITFILE Data Security Awareness training, with a deadline of EOB 19 Dec 2025.

## My Current Model
-   Mandatory training required by 19 Dec 2025.
-   Instructions provided two distinct paths:
    1.  For those who have completed it previously (sign-in, find course, play, complete).
    2.  For those new to the training (register, add reporting permissions, enrol, play, complete).
-   A specific note about the FOI section and assessment question.

## The Tension
-   **Path Ambiguity:** I am unsure which of the two training paths applies to me. Have I completed this specific e-LfH 'Data Security Awareness (NHSD)' training before?
-   **Context Capture:** The email contains critical URLs and instructions that need to be readily accessible when I perform the task.
-   **Prioritization:** While mandatory, this task needs to be integrated into my existing workflow.

## The Next Test
-   [ ] **Determine my training status for 'Data Security Awareness (NHSD)' on e-LfH.**
    -   *Method 1:* Attempt to sign in to <https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/> and check 'My elearning' for the course.
    -   *Method 2:* Review past training records or calendar entries for "Data Security Awareness (NHSD)" or "e-LfH" from late last year or early this year.
    -   *Success Criteria:* I know definitively whether I need to register or if I already have an account with the course listed.

## Action Plan (Once Path is clear)

### If Already Completed before
1.  Sign in to e-LfH portal: <https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/>
2.  Locate 'Data Security Awareness (NHSD)' under 'My elearning'.
3.  Click 'Data Security Awareness - Level 1'.
4.  Click 'Play', complete the course and assessment.

### If not Completed before
1.  Register an account on e-LfH: <https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Register> (using FITFILE email).
2.  Go to 'My Account' -> 'Reporting Permissions'.
3.  Enter username KOTS0262, click 'Find', then 'Add User'.
4.  Send my e-LfH username to the email sender.
5.  Go to 'My e-Learning' -> 'Full Catalogue'.
6.  Scroll to 'Data Security Awareness (NHSD)', click it.
7.  Click 'Data Security Awareness – Level 1', then 'Enrol', then 'Continue with Enrolment'.
8.  Go to 'My elearning', click 'Data Security Awareness (NHSD)'.
9.  Click 'Data Security Awareness - Level 1'.
10. Click 'Play', complete the course and assessment.

**Important Note:** Even if the FOI section doesn't apply to FITFILE, there will be a question about it on the assessment.

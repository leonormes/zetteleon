I am developing a prodOS anti-adhd system. I have created a lot of notes about it. They are mostly organised but as the idea of big and ambitious it is a little internally inconsistent. The sot for each component is spread across several notes. I need you to review the full prodOS description and look for inconsistencies. If you look at a system like GTD it has well defined section and processes that all fit together and are pulling in the same direction. I want my prodOS to solve a clear problem in a direct a way as I can. Any ambiguity is a breeding ground for ADHD woes.

Title: Action-Oriented Thinking: The A-C-T Framework for LLM Use

Tags: #ADHD #productivity #LLM #synthesis #Zettelkasten #ACTFramework

The challenge of combining divergent thinking (ADHD/LLMs) with the need for clarity is the Collector's Fallacy: mistaking information acquisition for knowledge integration.

The solution is the principle: "Think like a man of action, act like a man of thought." This is achieved by shifting from being a content consumer to a Process Director, using a repeatable, LLM-powered structure to force convergence and action.

⚡️ The A-C-T Framework

This three-step loop replaces over-thinking with a series of small, measurable actions (MVA) and reflections.

| Phase | Role / Core Question | LLM Prompt Function | Output / Action Artefact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Action | Define the Goal: What single action is this thinking supposed to lead to? | Converger: Converts amorphous input into a Minimum Viable Action (MVA). | A single, concrete MVA (e.g., 'List three expenses'). |
| Container | Define the Boundary: What is the finite scope of the work? | (Self-Prompted/Obsidian) | A One-Note-Container Goal in Obsidian (e.g., 'I must write one note, 100 words, titled X'). |
| Thought | Define the Insight: What did I learn from the action I just took? | Synthesiser: Analyses the raw data/results of the MVA and generates the next logical step. | A new, atomic Zettel reflecting on the data, plus the Next MVA. |

🛠️ Key Tactical Levers

 - MVA (Minimum Viable Action): Focus on the smallest, physical, concrete next step to break inertia (e.g., "Write three bullet points," not "Solve the problem").
 - Model Selection: Use Gemini 2.5 Flash for A-Phase actions (convergence, quick summaries, filtering). Its speed and efficiency reduce the output size, preventing the "comprehensive answer" trap that feeds the Collector's Fallacy.
 - Action-First Learning: Prioritise PoC (Proof of Concept) tests over reading (e.g., 90 minutes of doing on a test cluster reveals more friction than days of reading documentation). Knowledge is generated by action, then refined by thought.

This is a classic ADHD "displacement activity." You are substituting the difficult, ambiguous pain of **Executive Function** (doing the work) with the satisfying, low-stakes dopamine of **Administrative Friction** (organizing the work).

Your analogy is precise: **Writing is the Psychiatrist; Organizing is the Alcohol.** You are currently drunk on folder structures.

Here is your "Rehab Protocol" to separate the tool from the trap, using the core principles of PRODOS.

## 1. The Diagnosis: Why "Organizing" Fails as a Memory Aide

You want a memory aide that "brings relevant info to the forefront."

- **The Trap:** You believe that if you classify data perfectly (tags, folders, links), it will magically appear when needed.
- **The Reality:** "The Collector's Fallacy". Complexity increases *friction*. The more you organize, the harder it is to retrieve. A "rich mental model" evaporates, and returning to a complex web of notes requires high activation energy.

## 2. The Solution: Shift from "Librarian" to "Operator"

You need to fire yourself as the "Librarian" of your system. Your cognitive style is Abstract-Conceptual; you should be the **Architect** and the **Executor**, never the Administrator.

Use these three constraints to strip away the "alcohol":

### Constraint A: The "Zero-Toil" Rule (Stop Categorizing)

The "toil" of organizing drains the executive function needed for the actual task.

- **The Ban:** You are no longer allowed to create tags, move files into folders, or design templates.
- **The Fix:** Dump everything into **one** folder (`00_Inbox` or `Daily Note`).
- **The Mechanism:** If structure is needed, the "Chief of Staff" LLM does it. If the LLM doesn't do it, it stays messy. Your brain is for thinking, not filing.

### Constraint B: The "State Restore" vs. "Archive" Mindset

You don't need an archive; you need a **Save State**.

- **The Trap:** "I might need this later, so I'll index it." (Hoarding).
- **The Fix:** "What do I need to see *instantly* when I return to this project?"
- **The Mechanism:** The **60-Second Context Restoration Test**.
    - Every active project gets **ONE** note (The SoT).
    - At the very top, it must have the **MVU (Minimum Viable Understanding)** and the **Next Action**.
    - Everything below the fold is irrelevant history.

### Constraint C: Reality is the Only Output

The "buzz" you get from organizing is false progress.

- **The Trap:** "I fixed my folder structure!" (Internal change).
- **The Fix:** "Did I change the external world?" (External change).
- **The Mechanism:** Thinking is only valid if it compiles to a **Verifiable Next Action**. If you spend 20 minutes writing and don't generate a binary test (Pass/Fail action), delete the note. It was just anxiety, not work.

## 3. The "Psychiatrist" Workflow (How to Write Safely)

To use the "Psychiatrist" (writing to think) without drinking the "Alcohol" (organizing), follow this strict loop:

1. **Open a blank `HEAD` note.** Do not title it properly. Do not tag it.
2. **Vomit the chaos.** Write out the confusion, the blocks, the arguments. (This is the therapy).
3. **Run the "Logic Linter".** Ask yourself (or the LLM): "What is the actual tension here?".
4. **Extract the Action.** Isolate the single next step.
5. **Nuke the rest.**
    
    - Put the *Action* in your task manager.
    - Put the *one crucial insight* (if any) into the Project SoT.
    - **Archive/Ignore the HEAD note.** You don't need to organize the "working out." You solved the equation; you only need the answer.

## 4. Summary: How to Avoid the Danger

The danger comes from believing that structure = clarity. It does not.

Action = Clarity.

|**The Alcoholic Trap (Organizing)**|**The Psychiatrist Solution (ProdOS)**|
|---|---|
|Creating a perfect template.|Writing a messy list of bullet points to find the bug.|
|Linking 5 notes together.|Defining 1 action to take in the real world.|
|Asking "Where does this file go?"|Asking "What is the next test?"|
|**Feeling:** "I am in control."|**Feeling:** "I am uncomfortable, but moving."|

Next Step:

Go to your most cluttered, over-organized project note. Delete the tags. Delete the "backlinks" section. Delete the metadata. Leave only two things at the top:

1. **Summary:** "What is this?" (2 sentences).
2. **Next Test:** "What am I doing next?" (1 checkbox).

Do you have the courage to delete the noise?

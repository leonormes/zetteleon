## Problem and Requirements Statement for Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

### Context / Problem

I frequently work on complex technical topics (e.g., Azure AKS backup) and accumulate extensive notes heavily resembling official documentation. These notes, while thorough, are generic, verbose, and do not reflect my evolving understanding, assumptions, or thought process. When I return to a topic, I struggle to quickly recall or reestablish my *unique mental model*, leading to wasted time, frustration, and sometimes restarting from scratch.

### Core Challenge

There is a fundamental disconnect between:  

- The large, formal, often cumbersome documentation-style notes I accumulate  
- And the concise, intention-driven, assumption-rich *personal understanding* that lives in my head

My goal is to bridge this gap by building a PKM system that externalizes *my* unique thinking clearly and accessibly while preserving essential context and links.

### Requirements

1. **Alignment with Mental Model:**  
   The PKM artifacts must reflect my current understanding, concrete intent, assumptions, and open questions in a language/narrative natural to me—*not* just a regurgitation of reference docs.

2. **Structured and Lightweight:**  
   Notes should be concise (bullet/small paragraph style), chunked by intent/concept, and scalable to complex topics without becoming overwhelming.

3. **Actionable and Searchable:**
   Each note should include or link to small, achievable tasks for reinforcement (mini-demos, experiments).  
   It should be easy to retrieve just the relevant personalized knowledge quickly — e.g., for re-entry into a project or decision point.

4. **Maintainable and Iterative:**  
   The PKM system should encourage frequent iteration and refinement as I deepen understanding, surfacing changed assumptions or added insights clearly.

5. **Cross-Context Linking:**  
   Notes should link both laterally (concept A references concept B) and temporally (version/dates of understanding) to provide a living map of knowledge growth.

6. **Adaptable to ADHD Needs:**  
   It must minimize friction for re-entry and reduce overwhelm by focusing on dopamine-friendly micro tasks and clear boundaries for "what to do next."

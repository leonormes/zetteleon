I want to convey an idea to my 13 year old daughter. I spent 30 years as a musician and love music. She has a great interest in music. I have this idea that authentic music is raw of the people music like the tribal music or film music and early blues or jazz and so on. It is music that's purpose is music and social bonding and human tradition. But there is also music that is commercial and pop and controlled by business rather than human emotion and expression. This is not a value judgement. I just want her to understand the distinction. Early house music and illegal raves were people spontaneously coming together in celebration and there was no commercial engine behind it. It was organic. The same for early punk or rock when the artist was in charge. Hip-hop is another and the list goes on. Although just my opinion I think that authentic human expression is better than plastic pop that is just for mass consumption to get the most money. When radio and record companies artificially generate hype so as to sell.

But I am not expressing this idea very well. Elaborate on what I am trying to say and express it more impact fully

Here is an elaboration of your idea, framed in a way that might help you express it to your daughter.

You are trying to articulate a core concept in music: the difference between music born from **expression** and music designed as a **product**.

It's not about "good" vs. "bad," but about *intention* and *origin*. A great way to frame this for a 13-year-old is the difference between **"Music from the 'Ground Up'"** and **"Music from the 'Top Down'."**

## 1\. Music from the 'Ground Up' (The Spark)

This is the "authentic" music you're describing. It's music that starts with people.

- **It's born from a need:** It starts with a real, raw human feeling—a need to celebrate, protest, mourn, tell a story, or simply connect with others. It's the sound of a community finding its voice.
- **The artist is in charge:** The person or group creating it has the final say. They are trying to get a specific feeling or idea out, not trying to fit into a pre-made box.
- **It builds its own scene:** This is your point about early house, punk, and hip-hop. This music didn't start on the radio. It started in basements, warehouses, parks, and small clubs. People came together *around* the music, creating a culture (fashion, language, dance) organically. The "illegal rave" is a perfect example: the music was so important that people were willing to break the rules just to experience it together.
- **It's 'raw' because it's honest:** It's not polished to perfection. You might hear 'mistakes', feedback, or off-key notes, but that's part of its power. It's the sound of human beings trying something new, pushing boundaries.

**Examples you gave:** Tribal music (for ritual), early blues (expressing hardship), early punk (expressing frustration), early house (creating collective joy).

## 2\. Music from the 'Top Down' (The Polish)

This is the "commercial" music you're describing. It's music that often starts with a business.

- **It's born from a goal:** The starting point is often a market-driven goal: "We need a summer hit," "This artist needs a song for a TikTok trend," or "What kind of song is most popular on playlists right now?"
- **It's often made by a team of specialists:** Instead of a band in a garage, it might be a "songwriting camp" with specialist producers, data analysts, and multiple writers, all working to create a perfect 'product'.
- **It's designed for a system:** This music is engineered to sound great on the radio, to be catchy in the first 15 seconds, and to appeal to the widest possible audience. It follows the "rules" (like song length, structure, and sound) because its goal is mass consumption.
- **It's 'polished' because it's a product:** Just like a new phone or a blockbuster film, it's tested, refined, and packaged. The goal is to remove any "friction"—anything that might make a listener tune out.

## 3\. How to Bridge the Gap (It's a Spectrum)

This is the most important part. It's not a hard line. It's a spectrum, and many artists move between these two worlds.

- **Use an analogy:** You could compare it to food.
	- **'Ground Up' music** is like a home-cooked meal. It's made with personal passion, it has a unique flavour, it might be a bit messy, but it's full of heart. It's made for the people eating it.
	- **'Top Down' music** is like a perfect fast-food burger. It's engineered by experts to taste good to millions of people, every single time, no matter where you are in the world. It's incredibly well-crafted, but its purpose is different.
- **Share your preference (as a preference):** This is where you can be honest without being judgemental. You could say:
	> "After playing music for 30 years, I've found that the music that sticks with me the most is the 'Ground Up' stuff. I love listening and trying to hear the *person* in it, or the *moment* it came from. That raw energy is just what I find exciting. But that's just me."
- **Make it an activity, not a lecture:** The most impactful way to get this idea across is to *listen* with her.
	- Put on an early, raw punk track or an old blues recording. Say: "Listen to this. It's messy and loud, right? What do you think they were feeling? It feels like they just *had* to get this out."
	- Then, put on a perfectly produced modern pop song. Say: "Now listen to this. You can hear the craft, can't you? Every sound is perfectly placed. It's designed to make you want to dance *immediately*. That's an incredible skill."
	- Then ask her: "What do you listen for in music? What makes a song great *for you*?"

This approach turns it from a lecture about "plastic pop" (which might feel like a criticism of her taste) into a shared conversation. You're not telling her *what* to think; you're giving her a new, powerful "lens" to help her think about the music she loves, and to discover new music for herself.

This report provides an analysis of your GP interactions from the provided medical record, structured to prioritise efficiency and the underlying logic of events, in line with your **Abstract-Conceptual and Top-Down cognitive style**.

Your medical history indicates chronic management of mental health conditions (Depression/Anxiety, ADHD) and a recent focus on weight management.

## 📝 Health Overview (1974–2025)

---

### **1. Core Diagnoses and Chronic Management**

Your medical record shows continuous management for three primary conditions: **Depression/Anxiety**, **Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**, and recent **Weight Management** efforts.

- **Depression/Anxiety:** This is a **long-term issue**, first coded as **Anxiety State unspecified** in August 1984, followed by **Depression NOS** (Not Otherwise Specified) in December 2010 and February 2008.
    - **Management:** Primarily managed with the antidepressant **Fluoxetine 20mg capsules** starting in October 2015, with various dosing regimes over the years. The dosage was increased to **40mg** on 24 June 2024 due to poor motivation and lack of interest, and a depressed mood was noted in an undated entry. Earlier, you had a brief trial of **Citalopram** (Mar 2008) and **Escitalopram** (Apr–Jul 2008).
- **ADHD:** This was coded as a **Minor** problem in August 2022.
    - **Management:** Managed with **Elvanse 50mg capsules** (Lisdexamfetamine), starting around March 2023. A note from July 2024 indicates a requirement to remain under a specialist for continued prescribing under a shared care arrangement. Consultation notes mention finding that you "couldn't tolerate" Elvanse privately, leading to a trial increase of Fluoxetine to help motivation (Jan 2025).
- **Weight Management:** A significant focus in 2023-2025.
    - **Intervention:** Beginning in May 2023, you commenced treatment with **Mounjaro Injection** (Tirzepatide) via private weight loss consultations (MedExpress). The dose appears to have been titrated up and then down:
        - **Start:** 2.5mg (9 May 2025), then 5mg (19 May 2025).
        - **Titration:** 7.5mg (27 May 2025), 10mg (June–August 2025).
        - **Latest:** Back to 5mg (12 November 2025).
    - **Objective Measures:** Your **Body Mass Index (BMI)** has shown a clear downward trend during this period:
        - May 2023: $37.04\ \text{Kg/m}^2$ (Weight 120 Kg)
        - May 2025: $34.8\ \text{Kg/m}^2$ (Weight 114 Kg)
        - July 2025: $29.91\ \text{Kg/m}^2$ (Weight 98 Kg)
        - November 2025: $27.78\ \text{Kg/m}^2$ (Weight 91 Kg)

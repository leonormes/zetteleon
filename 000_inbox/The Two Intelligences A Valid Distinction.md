### **The Two Intelligences: A Valid Distinction**

Your distinction is a very effective way to frame a central debate in intelligence research. Psychologists have similar concepts:

* **Crystallised Intelligence (Gc​):** This is the accumulation of knowledge, facts, skills, and experience. It is the ability to use learned knowledge. This aligns perfectly with your concept of **applicative intelligence**. It tends to increase with age.  
* **Fluid Intelligence (Gf​):** This is the capacity to reason, solve novel problems, identify patterns, and think abstractly, independent of any pre-existing knowledge. This is very close to your **generative intelligence**, as it's about creating solutions and seeing connections that weren't there before. It is believed to peak in early adulthood and then slowly decline.

So, your personal observation has identified a fundamental dichotomy that intelligence researchers have grappled with for decades. We often overvalue Gc​ (applicative) because it's easier to measure with tests (e.g., vocabulary, general knowledge), while Gf​ (generative) is much harder to quantify but is often the source of true innovation.

### **Why Do We Take Intelligence So Seriously?**

Despite its fuzzy definition, we have a deep-seated societal and biological obsession with intelligence for several reasons.

1. **Evolutionary Hardwiring:** For most of human history, the ability to solve problems, anticipate threats, and innovate (e.g., create better tools, find new food sources) was directly linked to survival and reproductive success. A smarter individual or a smarter tribe had a better chance of thriving. We are evolutionarily primed to value and seek out intelligence as a marker of fitness.  
2. **Predictive Power (Even if Flawed):** While IQ tests are controversial, psychometric measures of general intelligence (the 'g' factor) are one of the single best predictors of a wide range of life outcomes. This includes academic success, job performance (especially in complex roles), income, and even health and longevity. Societies are built on the assumption that placing more competent people in more critical roles leads to better outcomes for everyone. Therefore, we take it seriously because, on a statistical level, it works as a rough sorting mechanism.  
3. **The Foundation of Meritocracy:** Modern Western societies are, at least in theory, built on the idea of meritocracy—that power and privilege should be earned through ability, not inherited through birthright. In this system, intelligence is seen as the ultimate 'merit'. It becomes a justification for social hierarchies. We take it seriously because it underpins our societal narrative of fairness and organisation.  
4. **Cognitive Heuristics:** The human brain relies on shortcuts (heuristics) to make sense of a complex world. Labelling someone as 'smart' or 'not smart' is a quick and easy way to categorise their potential and reliability. It's a mental shorthand that simplifies social interactions, even if it's often inaccurate and unfair.  
5. **Ego and Identity:** For many people, their perceived intelligence is a core part of their self-worth. Being seen as intelligent brings social status and self-esteem. This makes discussions about intelligence highly charged and personally significant.

### **Why We Fail to Recognise True Genius**

This is the corollary to your first point. If real, breakthrough intelligence is 'generative', then by its very nature, it is difficult for the existing system to recognise.

1. **Paradigm Blindness:** The philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn described 'paradigm shifts'. A truly generative idea often doesn't just add to the existing body of knowledge; it shatters the framework that knowledge sits within. When Copernicus proposed a heliocentric solar system, he wasn't just adjusting planetary tables; he was challenging a worldview that was thousands of years old. To his contemporaries, who were operating within the old paradigm, his ideas seemed absurd, not brilliant. A genuinely new idea is often unrecognisable as 'intelligence' because it doesn't compute on the existing operating system.  
2. **The Dunning-Kruger Effect:** This cognitive bias states that people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. A key implication is that to know how good someone is at something, you need a certain level of competence yourself. People of average intelligence may literally lack the cognitive architecture to grasp the scale and implication of a truly towering intellect. You cannot appreciate the genius of Einstein's field equations if you haven't grasped Newtonian physics. In short, **it takes one to know one**, at least to some degree.  
3. **Communication and The Curse of Knowledge:** A highly intelligent person can struggle to explain their thoughts to others, not because they are a poor communicator, but because the concepts are so new or complex that there is no shared language for them yet. This is the 'curse of knowledge'—once you know something, it's hard to imagine what it's like not to know it. The genius lives in a world of connections and ideas that are invisible to others, making it incredibly difficult to bridge the gap.  
4. **Social and Emotional Filters:** We don't evaluate others in a vacuum. A brilliant person might be socially awkward, abrasive, or threatening to the egos of those in power. We may dismiss their intelligence because we are put off by their personality or intimidated by their insights. We often prefer confident mediocrity to insecure genius.

In conclusion, we are caught in a paradox. We are driven by an evolutionary and societal need to identify and reward intelligence, yet the very tools and paradigms we use to do so make us blind to its most profound and transformative manifestations. We take 'applicative intelligence' seriously because it is useful and measurable, but in doing so, we risk failing to recognise the 'generative intelligence' that drives humanity forward.

## 🛠️ Required Tasks and Actions

Based on the email thread, here is a structured summary of the tasks that need to be actioned, prioritising the necessary steps for deployment and network connection:

### 1. Pre-Deployment Technical Checks (Immediate)

This is the purpose of the scheduled technical call, primarily driven by Jamie Wade (LCRCA Senior Engineer).

- **Review Prerequisites:** Run through the prerequisites to ensure a smooth deployment.
- **Confirm Environment Access:** Confirm that FITFILE has the necessary access to the environment.
- **Complete Deployment Steps:** Get started on the actual deployment during the 2-hour slotted time, assuming readiness.

### 2. Rollout Strategy Clarification (Prerequisite for Full Deployment)

Jamie Wade requires confirmation of the intended deployment pattern to correctly initiate change control.

- **Determine Rollout Pattern:** Clarify the intended rollout pattern (e.g., Phased approach like PoC Production, or a full deployment).
- **Advise on Change Request Timing:** Use the rollout pattern to determine when Jamie needs to raise a Change Request on the LCRCA side.

### 3. Change Request Submission (Required for Full Network Connection)

This is a specific, high-level administrative task for the LCRCA team, contingent on the rollout decision.

- **Submit Change Request (If Required):** If a **full deployment** and **connection to the LCRCA main network** are required, the LCRCA team will need to submit a change request.

### 4. Internal Coordination (FITFILE)

- **Prep Call Discussion:** Susannah Thomas is discussing Jamie's email further on an internal prep call at **3pm today** (08 December 2025) with Robin Mofakham and Leon Ormes.

Would you like me to outline the timeline of the scheduling for the technical call based on the emails?

The specific anti-pattern your wife is using is called **Forecasting**.

In the context of YNAB and Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB), forecasting is when you plan using money you expect to receive in the future rather than money you actually possess right now [1].

Here is a simple way to explain this concept and why it conflicts with the method:

### 1. The Anti-Pattern: Forecasting (Dreaming vs. Doing)
Forecasting is looking at future income and assigning it to future expenses in your head or on paper before the money arrives. This is dangerous because it is a series of guesses built on "what-ifs" [2]. It relies on everything going perfectly according to plan; if that future check is delayed or a surprise expense hits today, the plan breaks because the money wasn't actually there to back it up [1, 3].

### 2. The ZBB Rule: Only Budget Money You Have *Right Now*
The core of YNAB is **Rule One: Give Every Dollar a Job**. This rule requires you to look only at the dollars currently sitting in your bank account and ask, "What does *this* money need to do before I get paid again?" [4, 5].

*   **The Envelope Analogy:** Explain it like physical envelopes. You cannot put cash into an envelope labeled "Special Purchase" until you physically hold that cash. You cannot fill an envelope with an I.O.U. or a promise of money coming next week [6].
*   **The Scarcity Reality:** Focusing only on cash on hand creates a feeling of scarcity, which is actually a good thing. It forces you to prioritize. If you plan with future money, you falsely feel like you have enough for everything, which stops you from making necessary trade-offs with the money you have today [7, 8].

### 3. The "Mental" Budget Trap
You mentioned the plan is "in her head" and the category is not in YNAB. In YNAB, if a job (expense) is not written down as a category, it does not exist [9].
*   **Mental accounting fails:** When plans are only in your head, you often "spend" the same dollars twice—once for the new item and once for the electric bill [10].
*   **The Solution:** She should add the category to YNAB *now*, even if the balance is $0 [11]. This makes the desire visible. However, she must wait until the new money actually hits the bank account before assigning dollars to that category [12].

**Summary for your wife:**
"We can't give a job to a dollar we haven't hired yet. Until the money lands in the account, we can't rely on it. Let's make a category for it now so we don't forget, but we leave it at $0 until the cash actually arrives. That way, we know our budget is 100% real and not just a guess."

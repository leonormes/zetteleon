Hi Alex,

Thank you for reaching out. Please see below our key points regarding Bessie, covering who she is at her core, her specific challenges, and our hopes for her education.

*   **Strengths and Character:** Bessie is naturally inquisitive, caring, thoughtful, and highly creative [1]. At home, she is articulate and engaged; she has a particular passion for Art, History, and Film, and loves animals (especially horses) [1-3].
*   **The "Two Personas" / Masking:** There is a stark contrast between the calm, relaxed child we see at home and the distressed or defiant behaviours reported at school. We believe this is due to "masking" her neurodivergent traits (ADHD and potential ASD) to fit in, which leaves her exhausted and overwhelmed by the school environment [4, 5].
*   **Specific Learning Struggles:** Due to her Dyslexia/SpLD and visual stress (Mearles Irlen), she finds copying from the board incredibly difficult and demotivating [6, 7]. She often struggles to process verbal instructions quickly and has difficulties with working memory and spelling [8, 9].
*   **Anxiety and Behaviour:** Her behaviour in school (such as walking out of lessons) is often a flight response to anxiety and sensory overwhelm rather than willful "naughtiness" [10, 11]. She has a deep fear of being humiliated or getting things wrong publicly, which stops her from asking for help [12].
*   **Mental Health:** She has experienced significant emotional distress, including self-harm linked to bullying and school pressures. She requires an environment that prioritizes emotional regulation and safety over sanctions to help her re-engage [13, 14].
*   **Aspirations:** Bessie has a clear ambition to become a special effects make-up artist or work in the film industry [2, 15]. We want her to regain her confidence and love for learning so she can pursue these creative pathways.
*   **What we want for her:** Our main priority is for the support outlined in her ISP (such as the use of a laptop, blue paper resources, and scaffolded tasks) to be applied **consistently** across all subjects [6, 16]. We want her to feel understood by her teachers so she can access the curriculum without constant anxiety.

Kind regards,

Zofia and Leon Ormes

Here is the GTD methodology as an example of well organised system. It all fits together. Load it as context so you understand my request

## **I. Core Philosophy: "Mind Like Water"**

The central premise of GTD is that the human mind is designed for having ideas, not for holding them. When we try to keep track of commitments internally, we create "open loops"—incomplete tasks that pull on our attention and create stress. This stress comes not from having too much to do, but from breaking agreements with oneself by failing to capture and manage these open loops.

The goal of GTD is to achieve a state of "mind like water"—a martial arts concept describing a mental state that is clear, calm, and ready to respond appropriately to any stimulus without overreacting or underreacting,. To achieve this, one must move from "hope" to "trust" by externalizing all commitments into a reliable system.

## **II. The Matrix of Self-Management**

In *Making It All Work*, Allen expands the methodology by defining self-management through two axes: **Control** and **Perspective**.

- **Control:** Mastering the workflow of daily inputs and activities.
- **Perspective:** Aligning actions with higher-level goals and values.

Balancing these creates four potential archetypes:

1. **Victim/Responder:** Low control, low perspective. Operating in crisis mode.
2. **Micromanager/Implementer:** High control, low perspective. Obsessed with structure but lacking direction.
3. **Crazy Maker/Visionary:** Low control, high perspective. High creativity but unable to execute; often overcommitted.
4. **Captain and Commander:** High control, high perspective. The ideal state of "flow" and focus.

## **III. Getting Control: The Five Steps of Mastering Workflow**

To gain control over the "stuff" of life, GTD prescribes a five-stage workflow process,:

**1. Capture (Collect)**

- Gather every incompletion, idea, or commitment into a physical or digital "in-tray".
- The goal is to get everything out of your head so the mind stops worrying about forgetting it.
- Tools include physical in-baskets, paper notepads, and digital devices.

**2. Clarify (Process)**

- Process the in-tray item by item. Never put items back into "in".
- **The Key Question:** "Is it actionable?".
    - **If No:** It is trash, reference material, or something to incubate (e.g., Someday/Maybe).
    - **If Yes:** Determine the **Next Action** (the very next physical, visible activity required).
    - **The 2-Minute Rule:** If the action takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.
    - If it takes longer, either **Delegate** it or **Defer** it to a list.

**3. Organize**

- Park the results of thinking into specific categories.
- **Calendar:** Use for time-specific actions and day-specific actions only. Do not use the calendar for general to-do lists,.
- **Next Action Lists:** Organize deferred tasks by context (e.g., Calls, At Computer, Errands, Agendas for people/meetings),.
- **Projects List:** A "project" is any outcome requiring more than one action step that can be finished within a year. This list serves as an index of open loops.
- **Waiting For:** A list of items delegated to others that you need to track.

**4. Reflect (Review)**

- The system must be reviewed to remain trusted.
- **The Weekly Review:** The "critical success factor" of GTD. A weekly session to empty your head, process all in-trays, review lists, and update projects to get "clear, current, and creative",.
- Daily reviews involve looking at the calendar and context-appropriate action lists.

**5. Engage (Do)**

- Make choices about what to do in the moment based on four criteria, in this order:
    1. **Context:** What can I do where I am? (e.g., you can't buy milk if you are at the office).
    2. **Time Available:** Do I have 10 minutes or an hour?
    3. **Energy Available:** Do I have the mental freshness for a proposal, or should I just file papers?
    4. **Priority:** Given the above, what is the most important option?

## **IV. Getting Perspective: The Horizons of Focus**

To align daily actions with larger goals, GTD defines six levels of perspective, often described using an altitude analogy,,:

- **Ground (Runway):** Current actions (phone calls, emails, errands).
- **Horizon 1 (10,000 ft):** Current Projects (outcomes achievable within a year),.
- **Horizon 2 (20,000 ft):** Areas of Focus and Accountability (roles and responsibilities, e.g., "Parenting," "Asset Management"),.
- **Horizon 3 (30,000 ft):** Goals and Objectives (1–2 year outlook),.
- **Horizon 4 (40,000 ft):** Vision (3–5 year long-term desired outcomes),.
- **Horizon 5 (50,000 ft):** Purpose and Principles (Ultimate intention and core values),.

Allen advocates a **bottom-up approach** (starting with the runway/current actions). By clearing the decks of daily distractions first, one frees up the mental space required to think about higher-level goals and visions,.

## **V. Project Planning: The Natural Planning Model**

For projects requiring more thought, Allen suggests following the brain's natural way of planning, rather than "unnatural" formal planning which often stifles creativity,.

1. **Purpose/Principles:** Why are we doing this?.
2. **Vision/Outcome:** What does wild success look like?.
3. **Brainstorming:** Getting ideas out (e.g., mind mapping).
4. **Organizing:** Sorting ideas into components, sequences, and priorities.
5. **Next Actions:** Deciding on the specific physical actions to start.

I am developing a prodOS anti-adhd system. I have created a lot of notes about it. They are mostly organised but as the idea of big and ambitious it is a little internally inconsistent. The sot for each component is spread across several notes. I need you to review the full prodOS description and look for inconsistencies. If you look at a system like GTD it has well defined section and processes that all fit together and are pulling in the same direction. I want my prodOS to solve a clear problem in a direct a way as I can. Any ambiguity is a breeding ground for ADHD woes.

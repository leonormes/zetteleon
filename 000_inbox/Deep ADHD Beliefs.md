title: Deep ADHD Beliefs

This is a profound and common struggle, particularly when grappling with ADHD, which can make consistency and self-regulation challenging. The feelings you describe—believing you are lazy, a chronic procrastinator, and incapable of sustaining productivity—are deep-seated **identity beliefs**.

To dismantle these deeply rooted, unuseful beliefs, the most effective approach is to focus on changing your **identity**, not just your results. Your current identity is a "repeated beingness" derived from the accumulation of past actions, which serve as evidence for your beliefs (e.g., "I am a procrastinator" is true because you have proof of procrastination).

The strategy is to systematically create **new evidence** that reinforces a desired identity, using small, manageable actions that work *with* your ADHD, not against it.

Here is a comprehensive strategy for dismantling those beliefs, broken down into identity shifts and actionable systems:

---

## 1. Shift Focus: From Outcomes to Identity

The core of overcoming these beliefs lies in shifting your perspective from chasing goals (which often leads to disappointment and reinforces the feeling of failure) to committing to a **process** and embracing a new **identity**.

### Identify and Edit Your Beliefs

The first step is moving away from the belief that you are simply "a failure".

1.  **Acknowledge the Current Identity:** Recognize the blanket statements you repeat to yourself (e.g., “I’m always late,” “I’m terrible at sustaining routines”). These long-held stories create **internal pressure to maintain your self-image** and behave consistently with those beliefs.
2.  **Decide on a New Identity:** Instead of focusing on the *outcome* (e.g., "finish a big project" or "lose weight"), focus on the *type of person* who achieves those results. Ask yourself: **"Who is the type of person that could sustain a productive routine?"**. The answer might involve identities like: "I am a reliable person," "I am a person who shows up," or "I am a consistent worker".
3.  **Reframing Self-Perception (The Inversion of the 2nd Law):** Your specific cravings and habits are attempts to address fundamental underlying motives, such as reducing stress or achieving approval. If you associate tasks with positive feelings, they become more attractive.
    -   **Change "Have to" to "Get to":** Instead of viewing tasks as burdens (e.g., "I *have* to start this difficult work"), reframe them as opportunities (e.g., "I *get* to build endurance/skills" or "I *get* to work toward financial freedom").
    -   **Reframe Procrastination:** Procrastination is often a form of **motion** (planning, strategizing) that allows you to feel like you're making progress without the risk of **failure** that comes with taking action. Recognize that you want to delay failure, and instead focus on **practice, not planning**.

### Use Habits to Cast Votes for the New Identity

Every action you take is a **vote for the type of person you wish to become**. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time, not to be perfect.

-   If your goal is to become a writer, **each time you write a page, you are a writer**.
-   If your goal is to be a consistent worker, **showing up for two minutes** is a vote for that identity.

When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.

## 2. Implement the "Make It Easy" Strategy

The belief that you "fail at everything" is often reinforced by starting habits that are too large and create too much friction. The goal is to make good habits so convenient that you will do them even when you lack motivation.

### Focus on the Minimum Viable Habit (MVH)

To combat procrastination and the overwhelmed feeling associated with ADHD, utilize the **Two-Minute Rule**.

-   The Two-Minute Rule states that **when you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do**.
-   The point is not the minuscule task itself, but to **master the habit of showing up**.
-   **Downscale** your productive routines into MVHs, or "gateway habits," that lead naturally toward a productive path:
    -   **Instead of:** "Write for two hours," use **"Open my notes"**.
    -   **Instead of:** "Clean the house," use **"Put one item of clothing away"**.
    -   **Instead of:** "Study for class," use **"Read one page"** or **"Open my notes"**.

### Reduce Friction (The Law of Least Effort)

We naturally gravitate toward the option requiring the least amount of work, which is known as the **Law of Least Effort**. You can use this law to your advantage by reducing the friction associated with good habits.

1. **Prime the Environment:** Prepare your environment in advance to make future actions easier. For instance, if you want to exercise, set out your workout clothes. If you want to write, leave your laptop open to the document.
2. **Increase Friction for Bad Habits (Inversion of the 3rd Law):** Make procrastination and other unwanted habits difficult or nearly impossible.
    - If you frequently check your phone (a source of distraction that compounds into toxic results), 48], **leave your phone in another room** until lunch. The friction of retrieving it is often enough to deter mindless use.
    - If you waste time watching television, **unplug the console and put it in a closet** after each use.

## 3. Implementation Strategies for Consistency

For the "chronic procrastinator" label to be dismantled, you need clear, predictable systems to initiate the new, desired behavior automatically.

### Achieve Clarity with Implementation Intentions

People often think they lack motivation when they really lack **clarity**. Implementation intentions transform vague desires (like "be more productive") into concrete plans.

- Use the formula: **I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]**.
    - *Example:* "I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen".
- This removes the need to make a decision in the moment of action.

### Use Habit Stacking

Habit stacking leverages the brain’s tendency to chain behaviors, pairing a desired new habit with a **current habit** you already perform reliably.

-   Use the formula: **After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]**.
    - *Example:* "After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for sixty seconds".
    - *Example:* "After I close my laptop for lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk".
- For your ADHD-related goal of establishing a routine, this structure provides a necessary, predictable cue, which is especially important as habits are strongly rooted in their surrounding context.

### Utilize Accountability and Tracking

To ensure that "failing at everything" becomes a defunct belief, you need immediate feedback that affirms your success.

1.  **Habit Tracking:** Tracking keeps you honest and provides **visual proof of your hard work**. It acts as a reward, as it is satisfying to complete an entry or mark an X on the calendar. Tracking a habit leverages the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Laws of Behavior Change simultaneously, making it obvious, attractive, and satisfying.
2.  **Accountability Partner:** Knowing that someone is watching creates an **immediate cost to inaction** and can be a powerful motivator. You are less likely to procrastinate or give up if you risk failing to uphold promises to others. You can make a commitment to others by telling family, friends, or co-workers about your habit change.

## 4. Addressing Internal Struggles and Setbacks

The deep-seated feeling of being a failure is often perpetuated by a cognitive system that resists discomfort and makes setbacks feel fatal.

### Work with Resistance and Groundlessness

Habit change requires encountering discomfort and fear, which the **Childish Mind** (the part that craves comfort and pleasure) rebels against, playing a **Mind Movie** of how things should be easy.

1.  **Notice the Resistance:** Use **mindfulness** to turn inward and observe the resistance, the urge to quit, or the feeling of difficulty. Be curious about what the resistance feels like.
2.  **Practice Groundlessness:** The feeling of uncertainty or disappointment is referred to as **groundlessness** (not having solid ground under your feet). Practice staying with this feeling of discomfort and uncertainty instead of avoiding it through distraction.
3.  **The "Quit on the Third Time" Technique:** If you feel the urge to quit your MVH (e.g., writing that first paragraph), notice the impulse, pause, and continue. When the urge comes a second time, do the same. **Only quit on the third urge**. This gives you a tool to manage the impulsive nature of resistance.

### Manage Setbacks (Never Miss Twice)

The key insight is that **the first mistake is never the one that ruins you**. It is the subsequent spiral of repeated mistakes that establishes a new, bad habit.

-   **Create the "Never Miss Twice" Rule:** Make a rule to **never miss two days in a row**. If you miss a day, make sure you get back on track immediately, even if you just perform your Two-Minute Rule habit.
-   **Practice Forgiveness (Self-Compassion):** When you fail, **forgive yourself for any transgressions** and see the mistake as an opportunity to learn and solidify your understanding. Missing a few days makes almost no difference in the long term; what counts is what you do on the vast majority of days.
-   **The Plateau of Latent Potential:** Recognize that results are often delayed, leading to a **Valley of Disappointment**. The work is not wasted; it is simply being stored until you cross a critical threshold. Patience is essential to overcome this feeling that your productive routine is failing.

## Summary of Actionable Steps to Start Dismantling Beliefs

The most important step is to start small, standardize, and focus on reinforcing a new identity of consistency:

| **Handling Failure**             | **Never Miss Twice:** If you skip your habit one day, ensure you perform the MVH the very next day, reaffirming your identity as someone who doesn't miss workouts/tasks. | 4th Law: Make It Satisfying, Self-Compassion           |

**Analogy:** Changing a deeply ingrained negative identity is like carving a new riverbed. The old riverbed (your established bad habits and associated beliefs) is deep and strong. You cannot instantly dam the old flow. Instead, you must patiently and consistently channel small amounts of water (atomic habits) into the new path (your desired identity). Initially, the water barely makes a difference, but over time, through the continuous repetition of these small flows, the new channel deepens, and the course of the river—your life—is permanently diverted.

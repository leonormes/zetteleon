I'll provide you with a comprehensive overview of the psychological concepts and research related to self-perception versus others' perceptions. Let me search for the most current research on some of these specific questions.Now I have excellent information to provide a comprehensive answer. Let me address each of your questions systematically.

Comprehensive Guide to Self-Perception vs. Others' Perceptions

I'll address each of your questions with research-based insights and practical frameworks.

1. **Established Psychological Concepts and Models**

Yes, there are several established psychological concepts that illustrate the relationship between self-perception and others' perceptions:

**The Johari Window** is the most well-known visual model. The Johari Window is a visual framework you can use to understand more about your conscious and unconscious biases, which can improve your self-awareness and your understanding of others. It was created by psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham in 1955 while they were researching group dynamics.

The model divides knowledge into **four quadrants**:

- **Open Area (Arena)**: What both you and others know about you
- **Blind Spot**: What others see but you don't recognize in yourself
- **Hidden Area (Façade)**: What you know about yourself but haven't shared with others
- **Unknown Area**: What neither you nor others know about you

**Self-Other Agreement** is the formal psychological term. The degree to which a person sees him or herself as do others. This is actively studied in personality psychology research.

2. **Research on Self-Other Agreement Overlap**

The research shows **moderate levels of agreement** between self and others' perceptions:

**Overall Agreement Levels:**
In a meta-analytic study of more than 100 studies, Connelly and Ones (2010) found the following mean self-other correlations (corrected for reliabilities) for the dimensions of the FFM: Emotional Stability: r = 0.43, Extraversion: r = 0.51, Openness: r = 0.45, Agreeableness: r = 0.39, and Conscientiousness: r = 0.50.

These correlations of 0.39-0.51 indicate **moderate agreement** - better than chance, but far from perfect alignment.

**Variation by Trait Type:**

The overlap varies significantly based on trait observability:

The self has special access to inner experiences and thoughts to which others do not have access. For instance, the self has direct access to internal feelings of guilt and anxiety, whereas others may have a more difficult time knowing such feelings. However, for highly external or observable traits, such as "sociable" and "friendly," presumably both the self and other would have access.

**Greater overlap** occurs for:
- **Extraversion** (most observable - how talkative, energetic, sociable you are)
- **Observable behaviors and skills**
- **External characteristics**

**Smaller overlap** occurs for:
- **Internal emotional states** (anxiety, depression, self-esteem)
- **Agreeableness** (intentions behind behavior)
- **Values and beliefs**
- **Hidden thoughts and motivations**

3. **Factors Influencing Self-Other Alignment**

Several key factors determine how well your self-view aligns with others' perceptions:

**Relationship Quality and Length:**
Self-other agreement fluctuates predictably with additional information and exposure. Also, providing specific trait information can increase self-other agreement for both the specific trait about which information has been received and other linked trait judgments.

The status of the relationship between self and observer has appeared to be a relevant factor. Self-perceptions seem to be more in line with family ratings, followed by ratings of friends and cohabitators.

**Trait Visibility:**
Traits that are high on observability and neutral in social desirability tend to yield high convergence.

**Motivational Factors:**
The main motivational difference between self-perception and other-perception is the degree of ego-involvement. Although self-ratings as well as other-ratings could be influenced by a positivity motive, ego-protective biases contort self-ratings more than other-ratings.

**Self-Verification:**
People very actively try to get others to see them as they see themselves. You actively work to create consistency by communicating who you think you are.

**Important Finding on Self-Enhancement:**
In a large-scale meta-analysis (N = 33,033; k = 152 samples), self-report means generally did not differ from informant-report means (average δ = −.038). This suggests people are generally not seeing themselves more positively than others see them - the discrepancies are more about different perspectives than self-enhancement bias.

4. **Well-Known Frameworks**

**The Johari Window** (as described above) is the primary framework. Here's how it works practically:

It uses a chart with four quadrants — like the panes of a window — to organize different traits, improve your understanding of yourself, and clarify how others think of you.

**How to Use It:**
When people provide feedback about you, and you are receptive to it, your Open Area expands horizontally and your Blind Area gets smaller.

**The SOKA Model** (Self-Other Knowledge Asymmetry) is another framework that explains:
- You have better access to your internal states, thoughts, and intentions
- Others have better access to observing your actual behaviors and their impact
- Both perspectives are valuable but incomplete

**Practical Application:**
A good outcome is a perfect alignment between how you see yourself and what others see you. This happens when you are a very open leader who has worked with a stable group for some time. A common outcome is a difference between how you see yourself and how others see you.

**Practical Examples**

**Example 1: The Helpful Interrupter**
You might see yourself as enthusiastic and eager to contribute ideas (self-perception: "helpful and engaged"). Others might perceive you as someone who interrupts and dominates conversations (other-perception: "overbearing"). The reality is both are partially true - your enthusiasm manifests as interruptions. This is a **blind spot**.

**Example 2: The Anxious Achiever**
You might feel constant anxiety and self-doubt about your work (internal state). Others see you as confident and competent because you consistently deliver high-quality results (observable behavior). The gap exists because **others can't access your internal experience**.

**Example 3: The Strategic Silence**
You carefully consider your words before speaking because you value thoughtfulness (self-knowledge: "reflective and careful"). You haven't shared this with colleagues, so they might perceive you as disengaged or lacking opinions (other-perception: "quiet and uninvolved"). This represents your **hidden area**.

**Important Caveats About Individual Differences**
1. **Self-Awareness Varies**: People know fairly well how their personalities were perceived by close others (i.e., strong correlations between metaand other‐perceptions of Big Five traits), and they can make valid distinctions between how they see themselves and how others see them, but this ability varies considerably.
2. **Developmental Differences**: Self–other personality agreement tends to be lower in younger samples such as adolescents. Agreement improves with age and experience.
3. **Context Matters**: The level of agreement between self-report and peer report is fairly good and is actually no better or worse than the level of agreement between any two specific peers. This means even peers may disagree about you - there's no single "true" perception.
4. **Cultural Factors**: Self-perception and the importance of alignment with others' views vary across cultures, with collectivist cultures often placing higher value on social harmony and external perceptions.
5. **Clinical Considerations**: Certain psychological conditions (narcissism, depression, anxiety) can significantly distort either self-perception or the ability to accurately perceive how others see you.

**Key Takeaways**
1. **Agreement is moderate, not perfect**: Expect around 40-50% overlap between your self-view and others' perceptions on most personality traits.
2. **Both perspectives have value**: Your self-knowledge about intentions and internal states is valid; others' observations of your behavior and impact are also valid.
3. **Active work required**: Individuals with higher self-awareness tend to have better psychological wellbeing, more satisfying relationships, and improved job performance. Self-awareness allows us to manage our emotions, align our behaviour with our values, and communicate more effectively.
4. **Seek feedback regularly**: The most effective way to reduce blind spots and increase alignment is through honest feedback from people who know you in different contexts.
5. **Share authentically**: Reducing your hidden area by appropriately self-disclosing helps others understand your motivations and creates more aligned perceptions.

The journey toward alignment between self-perception and others' perceptions is ongoing and requires vulnerability, curiosity, and a willingness to see yourself from multiple perspectives. The goal isn't perfect agreement, but rather understanding the different lenses through which you can be known.

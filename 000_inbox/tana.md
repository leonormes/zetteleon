am drawn to tana.

- It feels like it would answer the problem of finding related notes.
- But it instantly made me start tidying.
-  Satisfaction from the tagging and grouping.
- And that is my trap
- I wasn't doing the thinking thing.
    - Cognitive realignment
    - large thought collider
    - think mash
- it is too much a distraction.
- it misses out on the systems I have created with LLM.
- it is more of a walled garden
- not going to invest more time in it. It is powerful but it is an ADHD minefield
